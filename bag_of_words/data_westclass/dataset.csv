PALESE,  The Toxiocology Center, Department of Pharmacology, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa 52242  Received March 12. 1975  The availability of a sensitive and specific assay for formic acid remains one of the limiting factors in our understanding of its role in the toxicity of methanol in man and lower animals (1). A great deal of information has been generated on the oxidation of methanol in lower animals and in primates (2-5) and, recently, the disposition of formaldehyde in animals has been studied (6). However, little is known concerning the disposition of formate in vivo in animals despite the relative wealth of information available on the metabolism of this substance in vitro (7,8). This is due partly to the lack of a suitable assay for formate in body fluids and tissues. Several methods have been used to estimate the level of formate in body fluids. Most of these techniques take advantage of the useful analytical technology in formaldehyde measurements. Grant (9) and later Reitbrock et al. (10) have used this to good advantage. However, it is our experience that procedures which depend on the reduction of formate to formaldehyde are tedious and subject to considerable variability. Furthermore, a steam distillation step is necessary for proper preparation of samples of tissues and body fluids. Therefore, another method has been developed in our laboratory. Since the description of a bacterial dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase, (EC 1.2.1.2.), by Johnson et al. (11) we have studied this enzyme either alone or in coupled reactions as a specific and sensitive method for the determination of formic acid. The method that is described in this report takes advantage of a coupled system of formate dehydrogenase with a diaphorase-catalyzed reduction of resazurin, a nonfluorescent substance, to resorufin, a fluorescent dye which is easily quantified by fluorometric methods. The adaptation of this coupled reaction to the measurement of organic acids was suggested by Guilbault and his colleagues (12) and with certain adjustments to the reactions cata1 To whom reprint requests should be mailed. 117 Copyright All rights  @ 1975 by Academic Press, Inc. of reproduction in any form reserved.  118  MAKAR  ET  AL.  lyzed by formate dehydrogenase and diaphorase a sensitive and specific assay for formic acid in body fluids has been obtained. Its use in determining blood formic acid levels in monkeys poisoned with methanol is described. MATERIALS Resazurin and resorufin were purchased from Pfaltz and Bauer. Nutrient agar was purchased from Baltimore Biological Laboratories and yeast extract was obtained from Difco Laboratories. Diaphorase, Type II, NAD, and NADH were purchased from the Sigma Chemical Company. All other reagents employed in these investigations were of the highest available purity. Pseudomonas oxalaticus, strain 11883, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. METHODS Growth  and Maintenance  of P. oxalaticus  A modification of the method of Johnson et al. (11) was employed for the maintenance and growth of P. oxalaticus. Cultures of P. oxalaticus are initially plated onto blood agar plates and incubated for approximately 2436 hours at 30”. The culture was then transferred to slopes consisting of nutrient agar and 5 mM sodium oxalate. Slopes were then incubated for 24 hours at 37” and immediately stored at 4”. The organism was subcultured at least once a month in this fashion. Induction  of Formate  Dehydrogenase  in P. oxalaticus  To induce formate dehydrogenase (FDH) in P. oxalaticus, a stored slope of bacteria was used to inoculate 50 ml of liquid culture medium. The growth medium consisted of (NH&S04, 2.5 g; MgS04 . 7Hz0, 0.2 g; CaCl, * 2Hz0, 0.001 g; FeSO, . 7Hz0, 0.005 g; MnSO, . 5Hz0, 0.0025 g; N&MOO, . 2HZ0, 0.0025 g; K2HP04, 8.7 g; NaH2P04 . 2Hz0, 7.8 g per liter of water. Yeast extract, 0.2%, and sodium oxalate, 0.05%, were added to this growth medium. A 50 ml aliquot of this liquid culture was placed in an Erlenmeyer flask and incubated at 37” on a rotary shaker. At the end of 24 hours, 10 ml of this medium was transferred to a 2 liter Fernbach flask containing 500 ml of liquid growth medium plus 20 mM sodium oxalate as the sole carbon source. A 1 ml aliquot of bromothymol blue solution (0.02%) was added to monitor pH changes visually. This liquid culture was incubated at 37” on a rotary shaker and the pH of the medium was carefully maintained at 7.0 by the addition of appropriate amounts of 1 M oxalic acid solution. The bacteria were harvested in the logarithmic phase of growth (about 24 hours later). This was equivalent to an optical density change in the liquid growth medium of about 0.5 at 540 nm.  FORMATE  Preparation of Cell-free from P. oxalaticus  119  ASSAY  Extracts  Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation in a Sorvall RC-2B refrigerated centrifuge. All subsequent operations were carried out at a temperature of O-4”. Pellets were washed twice with 100 vol of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer containing 1 mM disodium EDTA and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol at pH 7.4. The cells were then resuspended in a given volume of buffer and subjected to sonication (40 Watts at 20 kilocycles for 3 minutes at 15second intervals with 30 second cooling periods). The preparation was then centrifuged at 13,000g for 20 minutes. The supernatant solution was then centrifuged at 165,OOOg for 36 minutes in a Spinco model L-5 ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was analyzed for FDH activity. Measurement of Formate (FDH) Activity  Dehydrogenase  The specific activity of the cell-free extract was determined by measuring the rate of NADH formation at 340 nm on the Gilford 2000 spectrophotometer. A final reaction volume of 2 ml contained 1 mM sodium formate, 2 mM NAD, 0.1 ml formate dehydrogenase (FDH) preparation (2-3 mg protein/ml), and 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The specific activity of this preparation varied between 0.2-0.6 pmoles NADH/mg protein/minute. Protein analysis was conducted using the microbiuret method (13). Formate  Analysis  The enzyme preparation was stored in l-2 ml fractions in small vials at -80” in the presence of dithiothreitol (0.1 mM) and disodium EDTA (1.0 mM). No loss in activity was observed after 6 months of storage. It has been shown by Guilbault and colleagues (12) that pyridine nucleotide-dependent assays may be conducted with the use of the following coupled reactions: NAD+ NADH  + HCOOH +  resazurin (nonfluorescent)  -=+ a  NADH  + H+ + CO,  NAD+  + resorufin .  (1) (2)  (fluorescent)  Optimal conditions were determined and a routine procedure was developed from experiments described in Results. A final reaction volume of 1 ml contained NAD, 1 mM; resazurin, 20 mM; diaphorase, 0.03 units, and FDH, 0.006 units, in 100 mrvr phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. One unit of diaphorase activity (EC 1.6.4.3) is defined as the amount of enzyme which oxidized 1 kmole of NAD per minute at pH 7.5 and 25” in the presence of  120  MAKAR  ET  AL.  dichlorphenolindophenol. Standard reactions contained sodium formate concentrations between 0.5 and 10 ~glml. The reactions were started by the addition of FDH and incubated for 15 minutes at 37”. Reaction mixtures were placed in boiling water for 3 minutes and centrifuged to remove precipitated protein. The supernatant was brought up to a final volume of 6 ml with water. The change in fluorescence between 0 and 15 minutes (&) was determined using an Aminco-Bowman spectrophotofluorometer with an excitation wavelength at 565 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. A standard curve using 0.5 to 10 pg of formate/ml of reaction mixture was prepared for each experiment. Arterial blood and urine samples obtained from a monkey which had been given 3 g/kg of methanol orally were analyzed for methanol, formate, pH, pCOz and pOz. Blood gases and pH were measured using a blood gas analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory, model 213). Methanol blood levels were determined by a modification of the method of Baker et al. (14). Formate was analyzed by the method described above. Blood samples (1.0 ml) were diluted with 1.4 ml of H,O, thoroughly mixed and allowed to stand for 5 minutes. Then, 0.3 ml of 7.5% ZnSO,.7H,O was added and samples were thoroughly mixed. Then, 0.3 ml of 0.4 N NaOH was added dropwise with mixing and samples were centrifuged at 35,000g for 20 minutes on a RC-2B Sorvall centrifuge to sediment the protein. Aliquots of the protein free supernatant were used for formate and methanol analyses. RESULTS Specificity of Formate Dehydrogenase (FDH)  The lower limit of sensitivity for the spectrophotometric measurement of NADH is about 0.1 mM which can be increased greatly by determination of NADH using fluorometric techniques. However, with the use of a crude extract of P. oxalaticus and certain body fluids the measurement of NADH directly by fluorometric means gave less than satisfactory results due to fluorescent high background values. Also, attempts at purification of the FDH yielded preparations which were much more unstable than the crude preparation. Therefore, the coupled fluorometric method described by Guilbault et al. (12) in the presence of FDH was used in order to obtain a reasonably fast and sensitive method for formate measurements without having to spend a great deal of time on either enzyme purification or tissue preparation for analysis. Although Johnson et al. (11) had shown that methanol, ethanol, formaldehyde, oxalate, acetate, pyruvate, and malate did not react with FDH, these studies were repeated in order to show that these and other substances did not react or inhibit either the activity of FDH in the crude prepara-  FORMATE  TABLE SPECIFICITY  121  ASSAY  1  OF FORMATE  Compound  Resorufin formation  Formate* Methanol Ethanol 4-Methylpyrazole Pyruvic acid Lactic acid Sodium oxalate Citric acid Malic acid Acetaldehyde Formaldehyde Propionic acid Butyric acid Acetic acid  + -  ASSAY  Percentage of inhibition” 0 0 0 10 0 IO 0 10 0 0 0 0 0  ” Resorufin formation was measured in the presence of 0.1 mM sodium formate with other reactants as described in Methods. h The reactivity of a compound was determined by measuring resorufin formation as described in Methods.

Table 1 shows that a number of closely related substances and physiological metabolic intermediates do not serve as a substrate for FDH. At 0.1 mM concentrations, pyruvate, oxalate, and malate produced about a 10% inhibition of the reaction whereas the other substances tested had no effect on the reactions in the presence of 0.1 mM formate. The concentration of pyruvate and malate used in these studies represents about 20-40 times the concentrations that would be observed when blood would be analyzed for formate under our conditions. Determination of Optimal Conditions for Formate Determinations The pH optimum reported by Quayle (15) for FDH was at 7.6. This was repeated and found to be 7.4 using spectrophotometric measurements at 340 nm. At pH 7.4 the Michaelis constant (K,) was found to be 0.13 mM a value similar to that reported by Quayle (15). The reaction catalyzed by diaphorase displayed a pH optimum between 6.0 and 6.4 and the coupled reaction had a pH optimum of 6.0 (Fig. 1). The K, for formate measured by the coupled fluorometric assay was about 0.15 mM, a value that closely approximates the value obtained at pH 7.4 using the spectrophotometric method.

The amount of formate dehydrogenase was kept at about 0.006 units/ml of reaction mixture for optimal conditions and reactions were routinely performed at 37” for 15 minutes with shaking in a Dubnoff metabolic shaker under an atmosphere of air. Under these conditions no appreciable decomposition of NADH occurred and the fluorescence intensity of resorutin decreased only about 1% from values obtained at pH 7.4. A standard curve of formate concentration as determined by the FDH assay coupled with resazurin and diaphorase is shown in Fig. 3. It should be noted that under these conditions the curve is not linear and a standard curve was employed with every series of determinations. The limit of sensitivity is about 0.5 pg/ml of reaction mixture under these conditions. Table 2 shows that the recovery of formate from blood using a protein precipitation method involving zinc sulfate and sodium hydroxide, a method which was modified from that described by Somogyi (16). An average recovery of about 95% was achieved. Trichloroacetic acid was found to be inhibitory to the coupled reaction and competitive with formate as its TABLE 2 RECOVERY OF SODIUM FORMATE FROM BLOOD Formate addeda @g/ml blood) 10  20 50 100 200  Amount recovered (pgiml blood) 9.5 18.5 46.9 97.2 193.8  2 0.7 -r- 0.8 f 1.4 k 2.4 zt 3.3  Mean % recovery 95 93 94 97 97  ” Results were obtained from at least four determinations after the indicated amount of sodium formate was added to whole blood.

Perchloric acid was also unsatisfactory as a protein precipitant. Placing blood in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes was also less satisfactory than zinc sulfate:sodium hydroxide since the resulting supematant retained interfering pigments and blood treated this way contained some inhibitory substances which were apparently removed by the zinc sulfate:sodium hydroxide precipitation. The concentrations of zinc sulfate and sodium hydroxide carried over to reaction mixtures did not influence reaction rates. Urine samples were treated with one-sixth the amount of zinc sulfate:sodium hydroxide as that used for blood, amounts which assured complete removal of protein prior to formate analysis.

An oral dose of methanol (3 g/kg) was given as a 20% (w/v) solution.  FORMATE  ASSAY  125  was administered orally to a pigtail monkey (Mucaca nemestrina) as a 20% solution (w/v) in water. Metabolic acidosis, indicated by a drop in arterial pH with a concurrent decrease in pCOZ, was observed as blood levels of formate increased. Arterial pOZ levels remained normal. This pattern has been observed recently with other pigtail and rhesus monkeys and these animals show the relationship of formate blood levels and the metabolic acidosis seen in methanol poisoning in the monkey. DISCUSSION  A specific and sensitive method for the determination of formate in body fluids was developed using FDH coupled to the diaphorasecatalyzed reduction of resazurin to resorufin. The crude extract of P. oxalaticus which served as the enzyme source was actually a more useful preparation than more purified preparations of this enzyme. When the enzyme was purified from the crude extract the enzyme became labile and lost activity rapidly while the crude extract maintained about 100% of its activity in the presence of dithiothreitol (0.1 mM) and disodium EDTA (1.0 mM) at -80” for at least 6 months. The crude extract can be stored in small volumes and used when needed for the measurement of formate. The use of the coupled reaction was better than the spectrophotometric method (15) because of an increased sensitivity (about ten times) and the requirement for far less enzyme in reaction mixtures. Analysis of NADH by fluorometric methods was not satisfactory because of the relatively high background fluorescence obtained with the crude extract of enzyme in the presence of body fluids. Also, no distillation procedure is needed prior to analysis of formate from blood or urine. The method described averted these problems and allowed for an economical and rapid means for formate determination. This method can be used for a variety of purposes in laboratories interested in toxicology and drug metabolism. The lowest level of blood formate which can be accurately determined is about 1.0 mg%. Both methanol and formate measurements can be performed on 0.25 ml of blood at a low level of of formate in the blood. One example was shown (Fig. 4) where a pigtail monkey which had received methanol became acidotic with increasing blood levels of formate. Since a controversy exists concerning the role of formic acid in methanol-induced metabolic acidosis the technique will be useful in elaborating the part played by this acid in the overall toxicity of methanol in primates and man. Another use of this method would be the demonstration of formate as a product of the metabolism of certain drugs or chemicals. For example, many compounds that might be demethylated could conceivably be converted to formate and certain one-carbon halogenated compounds may be converted to formate in their conversion to carbon dioxide. The sen-  126  MAKAR  sitivity offered by this technique problems.

The assay is based on the reaction of formate with bacterial formate dehydrogenase coupled to a diaphorase-catalyzed reduction of the nonfluorescent dye resazurin to the fluorescent substance resorufin. Formate concentrations of 0.5 &ml of reaction mixture can be accurately measured. Small volumes of body fluids can be used for the analysis of both methanol and formate. The procedure described is simple and allows for the economical and rapid determination of formate. It can be used in studies concerned with the disposition of formate, as it relates to methanol metabolism. Also, it may be useful in studies where formate might exist as a metabolic intermediate of certain drugs or chemicals. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by NIH Grant GM 19420.  REFERENCES I.

The G1141+T transition is indicated by a star.  Since direct sequencing of the products from cDNA of patient JT revealed only the mutant "T" at position 1141, the patient could be either homozygous for the mutation or a compound heterozygote with a second mutant allele that is not transcribed or results in unstable mRNA. To distinguish between these possibilities, the area containing the G1141+T transition in genomic DNA was amplified and sequenced. The result demonstrated that in JT genomic DNA, only "TV' was present at the site corresponding to the cDNA position 1141; whereas in control (B142) genomic DNA only lVGVVwas present (data not shown). It is concluded that the transition of G1i4i+T in JT is homozygous. If JT is homozygous for the G1141+T transition, then parents must be heterozygous. Unfortunately, cells from father JT could not be obtained. However, analysis of cDNA (Fig. 2) and genomic DNA (not shown) from mother JT revealed her to be heterozygous (G and T) at position 1141.

The mutant stop codon in the a-L-fucosidase gene of JT cells might be anticipated to terminate prematurely synthesis of a-Lfucosidase protein and result in production of a truncated mutant polypeptide with a molecular mass about 10,000 lower than the wild type control enzyme. However, no difference in the molecular mass of immunoprecipitable a-L-fucosidase protein from cultures of JT and control lymphoid cells was detected by gel electrophoresis under denaturing and reducing conditions This apparent (6). contradiction can be reconciled by the occurrence of either of two natural phenomena that have been described in high eucaryotes (18-20). One is a +1 or -1 frameshift, permitting reading in the region of the mutant stop codon. However, this would result in the generation of additional stop codons shortly downstream from the frameshift. Thus, the occurrence of a frameshift is unlikely. The other is the reading of the stop codon by an aminoacyl-tRNA resulting in insertion of an amino acid and suppression of the stop signal. This could result in synthesis of a mutant readthrough polypeptide with a molecular size indistinguishable from wild type on an electrophoresis gel. No a-L-fucosidase activity was measurable in cultures of JT lymphoid cells which contained sufficient intracellular immunoreactive a-L-fucosidase protein (4% of control) to be detected by the enzyme assay (6). This can be explained if Glu-375 in the normal protein is essential for enzyme activity and this residue was replaced in the mutant readthrough protein by an amino acid not compatible with enzyme function. Our data suggests an apparent readthrough of the mutant stop codon in JT lymphoid cells. A review of the literature indicates that these data are the first evidence of this for a human genetic disease (18). This may reflect a natural mechanism attempting to correct deleterious mutations, but which obviously failed in the case at hand. REFERENCES  1. 2.  Durand, P., Gatti, R. and Borrone, C.

KEY WORDS:  Cysic fibrosis, DGGE, GC-clamp, Direct sequencing  INTRODUCTION Following the identification of deltaF508 as the major mutation causing cystic fibrosis (CF) ( I ) , approximately 200 additional mutations, sequence variations, and polymotphisms have been reported by members of the CF Genetic Analysis Consortium. The analysis of a sample of 482 Italian CF patients revealed that the frequency of deltaF508 in our population is equal to 53.6% of the total CF chromosomes (our unpublished results). In order to characterize the remaining molecular defects present in our population, we carried out GCclamped denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (2,3) on several exons of the cystic fibrosis conductance transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene in a sample of 86 Italian CF patients, followed by direct sequencing of those samples showing an altered electrophoretic mobility. W e previously reported the detection of 6 new mutations 0 1992 WILEY-LISS, INC.  and of 6 known mutations in exons 10, 11, 14a, 15, 19, and 20 (4,5). The mutations present in these exons account for about 70% of the total CF chromosomes in our patients. The present work reports further data on the DGGE screening of 9 additional exons which allowed the identification of four new mutations, five mutations already known, and one rare sequence variation.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  A sample of 86 unrelated CF patients, originating from all Italian regions, were selected for DGGE analysis.

Among these patients, 62 were compound heterozygotes for deltaF508 or another known mutation (2 W1282X, 1 G542X, and 1 R553X) (3,7,8) and an unknown non-deltaF508 mutation. The mutations present in an additional group of 24 patients carrying unknown nondeltaF508 mutations on both chromosomes were investigated using genomic DNA from the patients' parents, since the possibility of detecting a sequence variation is increased by the formation of heteroduplexes which follows the PCR when the DNA of an obligate heterozygote is analysed. In this way, a total of 110 uncharacterized CF chromosomes, 58 deltaF508, 2 W1282X, 1 G542X, 1 R553X, and 48 normal chromosomes were screened for exons 4, 7, 12, 21, and 23 and 54 uncharacterized CF chromosomes, 26 deltaF508, and 28 normal chromosomes for exons 3, 5, 9, and 22, by DGGE of DNA fragments amplified by PCR with specific primers coupled with GC-clamps. PCR conditions were as already described (3). DGGE conditions and primer sequences for exon 12 and 23 were those reported by Fanen et al. (9). For the other exons, DGGE conditions and primer sequences reported in Table 1 were determined using the Melt87 and SQHTX programs by L. Lerman (10). The amplified products were electrophoresed through a 6.5% acrylamide gel containing a linearly increasing gradient of denaturant ranging either from 10 to 60% or from 30 to 80% depending on the exons being examined (Table I), at 160 V for 2 to 4 hr. For each exon, a series of control samples carrying known mutations, kindly provided by other members of the CF Genetic Analysis Consortium, were analysed un-  der the same conditions and in parallel with our samples (Table 2). Samples showing an altered melting behaviour were sequenced either o n double-stranded DNA template as already described (4), or o n singlestranded DNA template, amplified using a set of primers one of which was biotinylated at the 5' end. The resulting biotinylated PCR product was immobilized to magnetic streptavidine-conjugated beads (Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin, Dynal A.S, N-0212 Oslo, Norway) and sequenced according to the Sanger method using Sequenase version 2 (United States Biochemical Corporation, Cleveland, OH 44122) (Fig. l). In all cases, sequencing was performed on more than one amplified sample in order to exclude the possibility of an error of incorporation due to Taq polymerase. Moreover, the genetic transmission of each new mutation was confirmed by the analysis of the whole nuclear family in order to exclude the occurrence of de novo mutations.  RESULTS Direct sequencing of samples containing sequence variations identified by DGGE analysis allowed the characterization of four new mutations in exons 4, 7, and 12, five known mutations in exons 3 , 4 , 5, and 7, and one rare variant in intron 12. In exon 4, a frameshift mutation (541delC) (Fig. 1) due to the deletion of C at position 541 was detected in two unrelated patients, both carrying deltaF508 o n the other chromosome and originating from Northern Italy (Lombardy).

In exon 7, a G to A transition at position 1172 causing the substitution of a histidine for an arginine (R347H) was detected in a patient who carries the deltaFS08 mutation on the other chromosome, and has mild pulmonary disease and pancreatic sufficiency (PS). This mutation, which is associated with haplotype C (KM. 19lPstI = 2, XV-ZdTaq I = 2), affects the same nucleotide which is altered in the R347P mutation (nucleotide change G1172+C) described by Dean et al. (15). Both mutations destroy an HhaI site, but can be distinguished since R347P also creates an NcoI site. The second mutation detected in exon 7 is a missense mutation caused by a G to A transition at position 1187 which generates an arginine to glutamine substitution (R352Q). This mutation creates a novel DdeI restriction site. T h e patient car-  rying this mutation, which is associated with haplotype A (KM.l9/PstI= 1, XV-2c/TaqI= l ) , has PS and carries a still uncharacterized mutation o n the other chromosome. In exon 12, a G to T transversion at position 1885 causing the substitution of a stop codon for a glutamic acid (ESSSX) was detected in four unrelated patients. This mutation is associated with haplotype B in three chromosomes and with haplotype A in the remaining one. All four patients carry unknown mutations on the other chromosomes. Of the three patients for whom clinical information is available, two have PI and one PS. Finally an A to G transition in third position of the splice donor site of intron 12 (1898 3A-G) has been detected in a pancreatic sufficient patient on a chromosome characterized by haplotype B. Direct sequencing of eight additional samples showing an altered electrophoretic behaviour allowed the identification of three G8SE mutations in exon 3 (12), one I148T in exon 4 (F. Rininsland, D. Bozon, and L.-C. Tsui, personal communication), one G 178R in exon 5 ( 12), and one 1078delT (19) and two R347P (15) in exon 7. No mutations were detected in exons 9, 21, 22, and 23 by DGGE analysis. A series of control samples corresponding to a total of 16 different known mutations located in the same 9 exons were also screened by DGGE (Table 2). Among these mutations, the only one which could not be detected under the conditions described in the present work is the N1303K mutation (13), since the control sample carrying this mutation did not display a melting behaviour different from that of normal controls. To detect the presence of this mutation in our samples, we carried out PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis as described by Friedman et al. (20). A total of 11 chromosomes which were negative at the DGGE analysis were shown by this method to carry the N 1303K mutation.  +  DISCUSSION The molecular diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is hampered by the great number of mutations described in the CFTR gene, most of which occur only in individual cases. This is particularly true in Italy, where the deltaF508 mutation has a relatively low frequency (53.6%) compared to Northern European countries (21). Moreover, among the numerous additional mutations reported so far and included in our previous analysis (4,5), only 1717-1G-A (5.7% of total CF chromosomes), GS42X (3.9%), and W1282X  NEW MUTATIONS OF THE CFTR GENE  (2.5%) have been detected in our population at a frequency higher than 2%. DGGE analysis using GC-clamped primers has already been described as a reliable method to identify DNA regions containing sequence variations which can be then characerized by direct sequencing (22). Combining these two techniques, we screened a total of 2362 bp corresponding to 9 exons of the CFTR gene, coding for a large portion of the two transmembrane (TM) and ATP-binding domains of the CFTR protein, and including intron-exon boundaries. In total, four new mutations, corresponding to a nonsense, a frameshift, and two missense mutations, and five known mutations were identified. In our experience, the mutations detected in these 9 exons and in the 6 additional exons already reported (4,5) screened by DGGE and other methods account for about 85% of the total CF chromosomes in our patients. The nonsense mutation E585X found in four unrelated patients and the frameshift mutation 541delC found in two unrelated patients lead to a premature termination of the protein product. Although it cannot be excluded that the patients carry other mutations in the exons not yet examined, it is most likely that these two mutations are the cause of CF in these patients. The missense mutation R347H substitutes a histidine for an arginine residue in the first TM domain. This mutation has been found in a patient who bears the deltaF508 mutation on the other chromosome, has PS, and mild pulmonary disease. The possibility that R347H is not a causative mutation cannot be excluded given the conservative amino acid change. However, the mild phenotype and the fact that no other mutation has been found in the same patient in the 15 exons examined so far still support the hypothesis of a role of this mutation in the pathology of CF. The second missense mutation (R352Q) substitutes a neutral (glutamine) for a basic (arginine) residue. The patient bearing this mutation has PS and carries an unknown mutation on the other chromosome. It has been suggested by Kerem et al. (1) that mutations causing CF can be classified as severe or mild with respect to the residual pancreatic function, and that pancreatic sufficient patients carry at least one copy of a mild mutation. The finding of these two missense mutations in two pancreatic sufficient patients (one of whom also carries the deltaF508 mutation which, in the homozygous state, is generally associated with PI), supports the association of missense mutations and mild phenotype with respect to pancreatic func-  317  tion (23). Despite these considerations, the only way to confirm at the DNA level the mutation status of R347H and R352Q in these patients is to extend search of mutations to the entire coding region plus introdexon boundaries of the CFTR gene. Finally, an A to G transition (1898 3A-G) in the third position of the splice donor site (AAG/gtatgt) of intron 12 (24) was detected in a pancreatic sufficient patient. N o other sequence variation has been detected in the same patient in the 15 exons examined so far. This nucleotide substitution was detected only once in 110 nondeltaF508 uncharacterized CF chromosomes, 58 deltaF508, 2 W1282X, 1 G542X, 1 R553X, and 48 normal chromosomes examined by DGGE analysis. Moreover, an A at position 1898+3 has always been observed in 12 normal, 5 deltaF508, and 29 non-deltaF508 CF chromosomes analysed by direct sequencing (J. Zielenski, personal communication). Nevertheless, since the general consensus sequence for splice donor sites of different genes has been reported as NNN/gt(a/g)agt (25), it is possible that this nucleotide substitution represents a rare neutral variant rather than a causative mutation. Analysis at the RNA level will show if this nucleotide substitution can actually cause an aberrant splicing of intron 12. It is of some interest that no mutations were detected in our sample in exons 9, 22, and 23. In these exons only a minor proportion of molecular defects has been so far reported to the CF Genetic Analysis Consortium; consequently, the absence of molecular defects in these exons in our sample could reflect the paucity of mutations in these regions of the gene. A n alternative explanation may be that mutations or sequence variations in these exons are not likely to disturb CFTR functions enough to cause CF and consequently they would not be found in a survey of CF patients; nevertheless, no sequence variations were detected in the same exons in 48 normal chromosomes analysed. Out of 16 different known mutations tested by DGGE, only one (N1303K) did not give origin to an altered electrophoretic behaviour under the experimental conditions presently described. This mutation is a C to G transversion at position 4041, and is the only nucleotide change of this kind examined in our study (Table 2): other nucleotide substitutions (including one G to C and one T to A) were all clearly evidenced by DGGE. The possibility of detecting a sequence variation in a DNA fragment depends not only on the nucleotide substitution itself, but also o n the base composition of  +  318  CREMONESI ET AL.  the sequence surrounding it (26). However, it has already been suggested that conservative transversions may not lead to an alteration of the melting behaviour of the fragment being analysed, because they do not change its nucleotide composition (27). Nonetheless, the approach based o n GCclamped DGGE and direct sequencing represents a valid strategy for mutation detection in genes such as CFTR with a large number of different molecular defects.  9.  10.  11.

Direct sequencing of 17 samples showing an altered electrophoretic mobility allowed the identification of four new mutations (541delC, R347H, R352Q, and E585X), five mutations already known (G85E, I148T, G178R, 1078delT, and R347P), and one rare variant (1898 + 3A-->G). The strategy based on GC-clamped DGGE represents an efficient and rapid approach for mutation detection for those genetic diseases, such as CF, in which a large number of rare molecular defects has been described."

Communicated by Michel Goossens  To investigate the molecular basis of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in France, we applied the single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method to the promoter region and the 18 exons of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. Seven probands, 4 heterozygotes, 2 compound heterozygotes, and 1 homozygote, belonging to FH families were tested. In all cases, previous genetic analysis and/or LDL receptor fibroblast assay had shown that the disease was due to defects in the LDLR gene. O u t of the nine mutations expected, one nonsense mutation in exon 2 and six missense mutations were identified in exons 3, 6,8, 11, and 15. Two of the latter were found in exon 6. In each family, cosegregation of the base substitution and the disease was observed. Ninety-five control subjects were screened for the presence of the six missense mutations. None was detected, implying that the mutations identified are deleterious. Our results indicate that the SSCP analysis of amplified genomic D N A fragments can be successfully used to rapidly screen mutation containing exons in large genes. Furthermore, all these mutations are newly described and demonstrate heterogeneity of LDLR gene mutations responsible for FH in the French population, as in other reported Caucasian 0 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc. populations. KEY WORDS:  Familial hypercholesterolemia, LDL receptor, Single strand conformation polymorphism  INTRODUCTION Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common autosomal dominant disorder that affects about one in 500 persons. FH is clinically characterized by an elevated plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration, tendon xanthomas, and an increased risk of coronary arterial disease (Goldstein and Brown, 1989). More than 50 different mutations in the gene encoding the LDL receptor have now been reported at the molecular level in individuals with FH (for review see Hobbs et al., 1990; Benlian and Loux, 1991). These mutations, preventing normal clearance of plasma LDL (Goldstein and Brown, 1989), are spanned throughout the 45 kilobases (kb) of the LDL receptor gene (LDLR) located o n chromosome 1 9 ~ 1 3(Sudhof et al., 1985). Twothirds of these mutations are gross gene rearrange0 1992 WILEY-LISS,INC.  ments easily detected by Southern blot analysis. Since detection of point mutations is more difficult and relies on systematic sequencing, their number is probably underestimated with only 16 described to date. To avoid sequencing of each of the 18 exons of the LDL receptor gene, it was necessary to develop methods to screen rapidly for unknown mutations in FH patients. These methods should enable localization of the gene defect, restricting sequencing to the targetted exons. A variety of methods have now been proposed (for review see Rossiter and Caskey, 1990), among them, the RNase A cleavage method (Myers et al., 1985) which failed to detect about one third of possible single base substitutions, chemical cleavage (CotReceived May 12, 1992; accepted July 16, 1992. *To whom reprint requestsicorrespondence should be addressed.  326  LOUX ET AL.

Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) (Orita et al., 1989) represents an efficient and technically simple method, but is limited to the study of 200 base pair (bp) fragments. With its short exons, the LDL receptor gene was thus particularly suited to the SSCP analysis. The technique involves the electrophoretic separation of single strands of DNA on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Under these conditions, electrophoretic mobility of a single strand DNA depends on its conformation, which is directly related to its nucleotide sequence. Therefore, any change in the sequence should theoretically generate a variant electrophoretic pattern. In the present report we studied a sample of French FH patients, from which previous genetic data and fibroblast LDL receptor assay had linked the disease to the LDL receptor gene. Furthermore, no major gene arrangement had been found. For identification of point mutations lying anywhere within the coding region of the probands, we have used the SSCP method to systematically screen the promoter region and the 18 exons of the LDL receptor gene. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients  Patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, tendon xanthomas in some cases, and a family history of high cholesterol levels and heart disease, were selected. A total of seven probands and members of their family, belonging to independent kindreds numbered 1 to 7, were studied. The diagnosis of  FH was based o n plasma cholesterol and LDL values in the patients. The four probands belonging to family 2, 4, 5, and 7 were clinically considered as heterozygotes with plasma cholesterol levels over 300 mg/dl, while the three probands belonging to family 1, 3, and 6 were clinically considered as homozygotes and had plasma cholesterol levels over 600 mg/dl before the age of ten with tendon and cutaneous xanthomas. In these subjects, analysis of the LDLR gene haplotypes revealed that two probands, belonging to family 3 and 6, were in fact compound heterozygotes and had inherited a different mutant LDL receptor allele from each parent. The remaining proband, from family 1, was genetically homozygote with a family history of consanguinity. In all cases, previous genetic data or fibroblast LDL receptor assay had associated the disease to the LDLR gene. PCR-SSCP Analysis  The PCR-amplified products of the promoter region and the 18 exons in the LDLR gene were studied with the SSCP method (Orita et al., 1989). T h e sequences of the primers that were specifically designed with the Oligotest program (Beroud et al., 1990) for this study are listed in Table 1. The other primers used were those described by Leitersdorf and co-workers (1990). PCR reactions were performed in a volume of 50 pl, using 0.5 p g genomic DNA, 200 pmol dNTPs, 1.25 IU Taq polymerase, 0.25 pl of [ c ~ - ~ ~ P ] ~ C T P , and 0.25 p1 of [ c x - ~ ~ P ] ~ A in T10 P mM Tris-HCL pH 8.3, 50 mM KC1, 1.5 mM MgCl,, 0.01% gelatin; 10 pmol of each primer were used to amplify the majority of the exons. For exons 8 and 14, 5 pmol of primers was used. For exon 18, 40 pmol of  FRENCH LDL RECEPTOR GENE MUTATIONS  327  TABLE 2.

Amplification conditions were 30 cycles of 1 min denaturation at 94"C, 1 min annealing at 55"C, 1 min 30 sec elongation at 73"C, except for exons 6, 9, 10, and 11 where annealing was at 62"C, and exons 12, 15, and 16 where annealing was at 56, 50, and 65"C, respectively. T h e labelled PCR fragments were diluted 1/10 in a solution of 0.1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA. An aliquot of 2 pl was mixed with 2 p1 of 95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromophenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol, heated at 95°C for 2 min, and put on ice. Samples of 4 pl were then loaded onto a 5 or 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with or without 10% glycerol. Electrophoresis was performed at room temperature at 5 W for 16 hr for glycerol containing gels, and at 6 W for 7 hr for gels without glycerol. The gel was dried onto 3 MM paper and was autoradiographed at -80°C for 20 hr. DNA Sequencing Exons displaying variant patterns were sequenced using the asymmetric PCR method (Attree et al., 1989). Following the first PCR reaction, a second amplification was carried out with an unequal ratio of primers (50:2) for 50 cycles, under conditions similar to those of the first PCR described above. To increase the specificity of the amplification, the first 10 cycles were performed with an increased annealing temperature corresponding to the T, of the primer in excess. Singlestrand PCR products were first purified and concentrated on a Centricon- 100 microconcentrator (AMICON) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and subsequently sequenced by the Sanger dideoxy method (Sanger e t al., 1977) (Se-  quenase kit; version 2.0, USB) using 10 pmol of the appropriate primer. Allele-Specific Oligonucleotide Hybridization Ninety-five control subjects were screened for the presence of the six missense mutations detected by SSCP in exons 3, 6 (two mutations), 8, 11, and 15, employing PCR-amplification followed by AS0 hybridization. After NaOH denaturation, 3/50 vol of the PCR reaction was dotted onto a charge-modified nylon membrane (Gelman Science). AS0 hybridization was performed under standard conditions (Saiki et al., 1986). The sequence of the primers used as probes specific for either the normal or the mutant sequence, and the appropriate washing conditions are described in Table 2.  RESULTS The involvement of the LDL receptor gene was ascertained by haplotyping, or by assay of the receptor activity on fibroblasts, or by both. Haplotyping of the LDLR gene was performed by Southern blot experiments, in all probands, with an average of 6 RFLPs. Segregation of LDLR haplotypes with the disease was observed in families 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 (data not shown). Haplotyping was also performed for the apo B gene, excluding its implication in families 1, 2, 4, and 5. In the remaining families, the mutation at codon 3,500 in the apo B gene was not found (data not shown). Furthermore, by fibroblast assays less than 5% of the normal amount of LDL receptor activity was found in probands of family 1, 2, and 6. In proband of family 7, 50% of the normal amount of LDL receptor activity was measured (data not shown).  328  LOUX ET AL.  FIGURE 1. Comparison of LDLR exon 2 DNA sequence in the region surrounding codon 12 hom a normal subject and proband 1 which presented an abnormal migration profile by SSCP analysis. The base substituted in the patient is indicated in bold and changes a Gln codon to a Stop codon.  In this study, the promoter region and the 18 exons of the LDLR gene were separately PCR amplified with primers which flank each exon sequence. Consecutively, each PCR product was analyzed with the SSCP method. Using this approach, we screened 7 unrelated FH patients for unknown LDLR mutations, and we identified abnormal electrophoretic patterns in six different exons, for six subjects. In the remaining patient, the migration patterns in all the exons tested were similar to those observed for controls. Optimal results were obtained with both glycerol containing gels and gels without glycerol, when electrophoresis was performed at room temperature. Sequence analysis of exons revealing variant patterns identified 7 base substitutions as yet unreported. The proband of family 1 has a C -+ T substitution of 12Gln (CAG), which creates a stop codon (TAG) in exon 2 and would cause a premature termination in LDL receptor synthesis. As shown in Figure 1, the proband was found to be homozygous for the nonsense mutation, and his parents were heterozygous for this mutation as expected from the family history of consanguinity. The proband and two affected members of family 2, father and paternal uncle, were found to be heterozygous for a G + A transition that changes 80G1u (GAG) to Lys (AAG) in exon 3 (data not shown). The proband belonging to family 3 was found to be heterozygous for a A -+ G transition that substitutes 290Lys (AAA) to Arg (AGA) in exon 6.

Surprisingly, sequencing of exon 6 revealed the presence of a second nucleotide change, that did not alter the electrophoretic mobility by the SSCP method, since the mother showed a migration pattern similar to that of the control (Fig. 2). It constitutes a G + T transition that replaces 283Asp (GAC) by Tyr (TAC). By sequence analysis, this mutation was found at the heterozygous level in the proband as well as in affected members from the maternal side of the family, mother and aunt. The proband of family 4 was found to be heterozygous for a G -+ A change that substitutes 347Cys(TGC) to Tyr (TAC) in exon 8. The abnormal SSCP pattern was present in the affected father and not in the healthy mother (data not shown). The proband and affected members of family 5, daughter, mother, maternal uncle, and maternal cousin, were found to be heterozygous for a G + T transition that changes '"Gly (GGT) to Val (GTT), This mutation detected in exon 11 is shown in Figure 3. The proband belonging to family 6, who is expected to be a compound heterozygote, has a C + T substitution at the heterozygous level that changes 705Thr(ACC) to lle (ATC) in exon 15. Inheritance of the mutation was tested in family members: the sister and the father, both FH patients, were shown to be heterozygous for the mutation as analysed by SSCP (Fig. 4).

The 7 base substitutions identified in this study are listed in Table 3 , their localisation with respect to the LDLR gene and protein are shown in figure 5. In some cases, variant electrophoretic patterns were found both in controls and FH individuab. Sequence analysis identified single base substitutions that did not change amino acids, implying they were polymorphisms. Two polymorphisms detected respectively in exons 2 and 18 were recently reported (Soutar, 1991; Cavanaugh and Esteal, 1991). The new polymorphisms observed in exons 10, 11, and 15 are described elsewhere (Saint-Jore et al., submitted).  DlSCUSSION In order to identify FH mutations in a French population, we have performed the SSCP technique to screen the promoter region and the 18 exons of the LDLR gene in probands, restricting sequencing to the exons revealing variant patterns. All patients whose migration profile was abnormal were found to carry a nucleotide change in the corresponding exon. However, in one patient the SSCP method failed to detect a mutation which was identified solely by sequencing: the 2 8 3 A ~+ p Tyr substitution carried by proband 3 and his mother did not alter the electrophoretic pattern of exon 6. However the 290Lys+ Arg substitution carried by proband 3 and his father altered the electrophoretic mobility of exon 6 (Fig. 2). This clearly shows that some nucleotide changes do not alter the electrophoretic mobility of amplified exons. In principle, after SSCP analysis, in a subject heterozygous for a mutation, the nucleotide substitution should generate two supplementary bands corresponding to the mutated DNA strand and its  complementary mutated strand. Actually, in the majority of the heterozygotes, we observed only one additional band. On the other hand, in some cases SSCP analysis can discriminate one change from another simultaneously present in the same amplified exon product. For example, substitutions found in exon 15, one mutation and one polymorphism, generate distinctly different migration profiles when analyzed by SSCP (Fig. 4). Thus, the ability of a single base substitution to alter the conformation of the DNA single strand is unpredictable and represents a drawback of this method. In our study, six mutations out of the nine expected gave abnormal migration patterns after SSCP analysis. Therefore, one-third of the possible mutations were undetected by SSCP analysis. This failure to detect an abnormal pattern was only confirmed in one case, the 2 8 3 A ~+p Tyr mutation in exon 6. For the two other expected mutations, since only the exons and the promoter of the LDLR gene were investigated, it can also be proposed that the two remaining undetected mutations lie elsewhere within the gene. Although numerous methods have been designed to detect single base substitutions in PCR products, none of them is both technically simple and powerful enough to detect 100% of the possible mutations. Thus, coupling of these scanning methods should increase the probability of detecting mutations. Two methods have been reported recently that are technically simple to use. O n e is derived from SSCP, the rSSCP method which uses RNA instead of DNA (Danenberg et al., 1992; Sarkar et al., 1992). The other, the heteroduplex method, can complement the SSCP analysis because its principle does not rely on secondary structure formation (White et al., 1992). In this study, we identified one nonsense mutation and six missense mutations. The nonsense mutation identified in codon 12 gives rise to a premature stop codon which eliminates almost all of the LDL receptor domains. This strongly suggests that the "Gln +- Stop change leads to a variant which fails to produce any LDL receptor protein. For the six missense mutations detected, the fact that we have not found these nucleotide changes in 95 control individuals, together with the segregation of these mutations with the FH phenotype in affected families, supports the hypothesis that these novel mutations are the cause of the disease. Furthermore, these variations affect amino acids that lie in domains important for maturation and function of the LDL receptor protein (Fig. 5).  FRENCH LDL RECEPTOR GENE MUTATIONS  * A  I  +5  5'  Exon  **  *  *  *  *  I  3' 3  4 5 6  -  Signal  Ligand  Sequence  Binding  789101112131415  Y  331  Y  EGF Precursor  0-linked  Homology  Sugars  7% Membrane-  Gene  Cytoplasmic  Spanning  A B  Amino Acid  * *  **  *  *  12 80  283 290  347  528  * 705  FIGURE5.

These mutations result in a change of a basic for an acidic amino acid in the second and the seventh repeat, respectively. Although these substitutions are expected to affect the binding of the LDL receptor to its ligand, previous studies have demonstrated that amino acid substitutions in conserved domains of cysteine-rich repeats alter the transport of the LDL receptor protein from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex (Leitersdorf et al., 1988, 1990). These mutations seem to interfere with the normal folding of the protein and prevent the transport of the unproperly folded protein out of the ER. The same substitution of a lysine for a glutamic acid residue identified in the highly conserve negatively charged amino acids near the COOH terminus of the second repeat was previously observed in the same sequence but in the fifth repeat (Leitersdorf et al., 1990). The resulting protein was not transported normally out of the  ER. Since the nature and the number of amino acids located between cysteines are important for the proper folding of the protein, it can be proposed that the 290Lys + Arg substitution found near the last cysteine of the seventh repeat, interferes with the normal folding of the LDL receptor protein. Indeed steric hindrance of arginine is greater than that of lysine. The missense mutation found in codon 347 is located in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) like domain, which contains 3 cysteine-rich repeats (A, B, and C). Each repeat contains 6 cysteines that are normally involved in the formation of disulfide bonds. The mutation located in repeat B substitutes a tyrosine for a cysteine, giving rise to an unpaired cysteine. Another missense mutation, previously reported, results in the same substitution of a tyrosine for a cysteine but in repeat C (Leitersdorf et al., 1990). The effect of this mutation is to block the transport of the protein to the cell surface. Similarly, it can be proposed that the loss of a cysteine may alter the proper folding of the LDL receptor protein, and thus prevent the transport of the protein out of the ER. The other mutation found in the EGF like domain that causes a substitution of a valine for a glycine at residue 528 does not reside in a cystein-rich region. However, the resulting LDL receptor protein may not be transported to the cell surface as an identical substitution of a valine for a glycine previously reported at residue 544 (Esser and Russel, 1988).  332  LOUX ET AL.  These authors demonstrated that this substitution gave rise to a protein that is not transported out of the RE, and rapidly degraded. The last missense mutation was identified in exon 15, which encodes the 0-linked sugar domain. This mutation results in the change of an isoleucine for a threonine which is involved in the attachment of 0-linked carbohydrate chains. The function of these 0-linked sugars remains unknown. Divergent results have been reported concerning this domain. Davis and colleagues (1987) reported the construction of a cDNA with an exon 15 deletion which had no effect on receptor function in transfected fibroblasts, whereas Kaj inami and co-workers (1988) described an exon 15 deletion found in an FH patient. The mutation reported in the present study is the first point mutation identified in this domain. In conclusion, the work reported here demonstrates the usefullness of the SSCP method, applied to the detection of point mutations in the LDLR gene. Furthermore, the wide distribution throughout the gene and the heterogeneity of the base substitutions identified in this French population are in agreement with previous results reported in other Caucasian populations (Benlian and Loux, 1991; Russel et al., 1989).

Seven probands, 4 heterozygotes, 2 compound heterozygotes, and 1 homozygote, belonging to FH families were tested. In all cases, previous genetic analysis and/or LDL receptor fibroblast assay had shown that the disease was due to defects in the LDLR gene. Out of the nine mutations expected, one nonsense mutation in exon 2 and six missense mutations were identified in exons 3, 6, 8, 11, and 15. Two of the latter were found in exon 6. In each family, cosegregation of the base substitution and the disease was observed. Ninety-five control subjects were screened for the presence of the six missense mutations. None was detected, implying that the mutations identified are deleterious. Our results indicate that the SSCP analysis of amplified genomic DNA fragments can be successfully used to rapidly screen mutation containing exons in large genes. Furthermore, all these mutations are newly described and demonstrate heterogeneity of LDLR gene mutations responsible for FH in the French population, as in other reported Caucasian populations."

In this report, four individuals with this syndrome are described carrying germline point mutations in the Wilms' tumour suppressor gene, WT1. Three of these mutations were in the zinc finger domains of WT1. The fourth occurred within intron 9, preventing splicing at one of the alternatively chosen splice donor sites of exon 9 when assayed in vitro.

These features suggest that the causal gene is important for maintenance of extracellular calcium homeostasis by the parathyroid gland and kidney. To identify the chromosomal location of FHH gene(s), we clinically evaluated 114 individuals in four unrelated affected families and performed linkage analyses. The disease gene mapped to the long arm of chromosome 3 in each family (combined maximum multipoint lod score = 20.67).

We have now established that SCN4A is the disease gene in PMC by identifying two different single-base coding sequence alterations in PMC families. Both mutations affect highly conserved residues in the III-IV cytoplasmic loop, a portion of the sodium channel thought to pivot in response to membrane depolarization, thereby blocking and inactivating the channel. Abnormal function of this cytoplasmic loop therefore appears to produce the Na+ current abnormality and the unique temperature-sensitive clinical phenotype in this disorder.  sensitive Na+ gating can be achieved in vitro by expressing only the a subunit (Nodaet al., 1986a; Goldin et al., 1986; Suzuki et al., 1988; Auld et al., 1988). To date, distinct a subunits have been identified for four brain sodium channels, along with separate skeletal and cardiac mUSCle SOdium channels (Noda et al., 1986b; Kayano et al., 1988; Auld et al., 1988; Rogartet al., 1989; Trimmer et al., 1989; Kallen et al., 1990). All share a common structure of fOUr similar domains, each consisting of six membrane-spanning regions (Figure 1). The four domains, which are thought to surround the channel pore, are connected by intracellular loops of varying sizes. Genetic linkage studies implicate SCN4A, the locus encoding the human skeletal muscle sodium channel a subunit, as the site of the primary defect in both paramyotonia congenita (PMC) (lod score i = 35.36 at r?l= 0.0) and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) (i = 33.58 at 6 = O.O), two autosomal dominant disorders characterized by episodes of abnormal muscle membrane excitability (Fontaine et al., 1990; Koch et al., 1991 a, 1991 b; PtaEek et al., 1991 a, 1991 b; McClatchey et al., 1992). Clinically, the two disorders are distinct (Engel, 1986). PMC involves a mutation that leads to cold-induced myotonia (stiffness due to muscle membrane hyperexcitability). By contrast, HPP involves periodic attacks of muscle paralysis associated with elevated serum K’. In both disorders, electrophysiological studies have revealed an abnormal, tetrodotoxin-blockable Na’ current in diseased muscle. In HPP, depolarization of the muscle membrane appears to result from incomplete channel inactivation in the presence of high K+ (Lehmann-Horn et al., 1987a, 1991; Cannon et al., 1991). By contrast, in PMC an increased Na+ flux is produced by cooling the muscle below 27% (Lehmann-Horn et al., 1987b). The fact that at least two different neuromuscular disorders may involve molecular defects in SCN4A presents a unique opportunity to correlate a disturbance in channel function with a structural change in a specific domain of the sodium channel protein. Mutations in transmembrane segments have been described recently in HPP (PtaEek et al., 1991~; Rojas et al., 1991) but no SCN4A mutations have been reported in PMC. Here, we identify two PMC mutations which, unlike the HPP lesions, implicate improper function of the III-IV cytoplasmic loop of the sodium channel in this cold-sensitive disorder. To our knowledge, this is the first delineation of a precise molecular defect for a temperature-sensitive human disorder.  Introduction Results Voltage-gated sodium channelson the surface of excitable cells are responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potentials (Barchi, 1988; Catterall, 1988). Consequently, there has been considerable interest in delineating their molecular structure and functional domains. Mammalian sodium channels consist of a large a subunit and one or two smaller 8 subunits. However, voltage-  A Gly-Val Change in the III-IV Cytoplasmic Loop We have previously used haplotype analysis with (dGdA), and (dGdT), repeat polymorphisms at the SCN4A locus to forecast that both disorders display allelic heterogeneity, with at least two independent mutations predicted to have occurred in each (McClatchey et al., 1992). We have also  Cell 770  I  II  III  IV  n  Intracellular  COOH NH2  i ?

I. M. et al., unpublished data). Using genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify SCN4A exons followed by direct sequence analysis of the uncloned amplified product, we scanned for mutations in lymphoblast DNAfrom members of two independent PMC families. We first identified a base pair change that cosegregated with the disorder in a PMC family of Belgian origin (Figure 2). The mutation, a G-T transversion (Figure 3), produces a Gly-Val change in the highly conserved intracellular loop connecting domains Ill and IV (Figure 1) of the sodium channel. The affected Gly is one of a pair of glycines that is present at this position in all known sodium channels. For affected individual II-2 of the Belgian pedigree, no other deviation in comparison with several normal individuals was found when the 80% of the sodium channel coding sequence for which the intron-exon structure has been determined was scanned, including the regions surrounding both reported HPP mutations. The same mutation was subsequently detected in the only two available affected individuals in an independent North American pedigree, ascertained by myotonia in a distribution of muscles characteristic of PMC.

None displayed the candidate mutation. In addition, some affected individuals from the Belgian and North American families were homozygous for the GAlIGT6 haplotype but were heterozygous for the G-T transversion.

The six affected members of this family did not possess the G-T transversion, but did reveal a discrete change in the same region of the III-IV cytoplasmic loop. A C-T transition (Figure 4) altered a Thr-Met, 6 amino acids beyond the site of the Gly-Val change in the other PMC families (data not shown). This second candidate mutation affects an amino acid residue that is also common to all known sodium channels. The  HUMAN  SKEL.  Discussion Several lines of evidence have indicated that the III-IV intracellular loop is crucial for normal sodium channel function. An analogous cytoplasmic structure in potassium channels appears to act as a “ball and chain” to block the channel pore (Hoshi et al., 1990). Antibodies to the III-IV intracellular domain of the sodium channel slow inactivation in both rat muscle cells and rat brain neurons (Vassilev et al., 1988,  MVSCLE  RAT  SKEL.

The GA41GT8 haplotype is extremely rare in the normal population (<lo/o) and was unrepresented among our control chromosomes (McClatchey et al., 1992). Therefore, the unlikely possibility that this could represent a very rare polymorphism strictly associated with the GA4/GT8 haplotype cannot be formally excluded.

The sites of mutation in PMC are starred. entire III-IV cytoplasmic loop of the human channel and of several 1988b; Salkoff et al., 1987; Kayano et al., 1988; Auld et al., 1988; 1990). Residues identical to the human sequence are boxed.  Cell 772  1989). When sodium channels are expressed in Xenopus oocytes, deletion or cleavage of the III-IV loop slows inactivation (Stuhmer et al., 1989). Moreover, activation of protein kinase C in sodium channel-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells causes a slowing of inactivation associated with the phosphorylation of a specific Ser residue in the III-IV loop (West et al., 1991). Recent studies focusing on the Ill-IV loop of the sodium channel and the analogous amino terminus of the K’ channel suggest a structural interaction between inactivating domains and parts of the channel involved in activation (Moorman et al., 1990; Bezanilla et al., 1991). In particular, exchanging a basic Arg residue for an acidic Glu residue in the rat brain Ill sodium channel Ill-IV loop affected both activation and inactivation of the channel (Moorman et al., 1990). Thus, this highly conserved structure appears to play a major role in all aspects of channel gating. The Gly-Val alteration and, most likely, the Thr-Met substitution that we report here in the cytoplasmic III-IV loop are associated with a temperature-sensitive clinical phenotype. The Gly affected is one of a pair of glycines present at this position in all sodium channels sequenced to date, including species as widely separated as man and Drosophila (Figure 4). The extraordinary conservation of this Gly-Gly pair implies that it is of critical functional importance, probably conferring flexibility to this domain of the sodium channel protein. We suggest that the substitution of the more rigid Val for Gly stiffens this normally flexible domain of the molecule, restricting its movement in response to changes in transmembrane potential (Schulz and Schirmer, 1979). At normal temperatures, this mutation has minimal clinical significance. However, even a minor drop in temperature may impede movement of the loop sufficiently to allow an abnormal Na+ flux. The Thr residue affected in the other PMC family is also remarkably conserved (Figure 4), though the effect of substituting the nonpolar Met for the polar Thr is less predictable. We have recently identified additional PMC families associated with neither the GAlIGT6 nor the GA4/GT8 haplotype, suggesting that additional PMC mutations exist (A. I. M. et al., unpublished data). We anticipate that these will reside either in the III-IV cytoplasmic loop region or in a functionally similar or interacting domain. The discovery of mutations in SCN4A associated with PMC establishes this locus as the disease gene, as predicted from linkage studies. In view of the report of two different SCN4A mutations in HPP (PtBcek et al., 1991c; Rojas et al., 1991), our data also demonstrate that altering different domains of the sodium channel protein can produce distinctly different phenotypes. The HPP mutations, a Thr-Met change in S5 of domain II and a Met+Val change in S6 of domain IV, both affect transmembrane regions far from the Ill-IV cytoplasmic loop implicated in PMC. The SCN4A locus has also been proposed as a candidate gene in certain other neuromuscular disorders, including forms of myotonia congenita and the SchwarzJampel syndrome (Lehmann-Horn et al., 1990; laizzo et al., 1991). Thus, PMC may be one of an emerging group of distinct neuromuscular disorders arising from mutations in functionally disparate regions of this sodium channel. Their clinical manifestations demonstrate the extent to  which environmental variables (e.g., temperature, extracellular K’) may modulate expression of a genetic defect (Engel, 1986). These intriguing neuromuscular disorders may be viewed as natural experiments providing clues to the relationship between the structure of this sodium channel and its function at the molecular, tissue, and organismal levels. Experimental Procedures PMC Families  Diagnosis of PMC was based on standard criteria (Engel, 1986). The proband in the Belgian family (III-1 in Figure 2) manifests disabling muscle stiffness when exposed to cold, but has no history of any paralytic attacks (Van den Bergh et al. 1991). Neurologic signs include myotoniaof the eye, tongue, and arm muscles. Changes in compound muscle action potential characteristic of PMC were measured after muscle cooling. The North American family with the Gly-Val change comprises two affected siblings of German ancestry with severe myotonia (without dystrophy) predominantly affecting eyelid, finger, and toe muscles, a pattern characteristic of PMC. These patients describe chronic stiffness of affected muscles but have not noted aggravation of the myotonia by cold. Detailed physiological testing of cold sensitivity has not been possible for these individuals. The other PMC family, a North American pedigree of English ancestry, has six affected members who all suffer from cold-induced myotonia. For all families, affected and unaffected members donated blood samples, which were used for both direct DNA preparation (Seizinger et al., 1986; Raskind et al., 1991) and for initiation of permanent lymphoblastoid cell lines (Anderson and Gusella, 1984) as a permanent source of DNA (Gusella et al., 1979). PCR and Sequencing of SCN4A Mutations Detection of both mutations was accomplished by first PCR amplifying the exon shown m Figure 4 and then directly sequencfng the uncloned amplification product. Approximately 100-200 ng of genomic DNA was amplified by PCR (40 cycles of 1 min at 94%; 2 min at 62%; 3 mm at 72OC) in a 50 ~1 reaction using Boehringer-Mannheim PCR buffer plus 400 PM deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 2.5 U of Taq polymerase (Boehringer-Mannheim), and 50-75 ng of each of the following primers: primer 1, 5’-GGCTGCCTTAAAGGTGAGG-3’; primer 2, 5’GGTGGAAGGCAGGAAACC-3’. The product is 283 bp in size and contains the exon with flanking intron on both sides (A. I. M. et al., unpublished data). The PCA product was purified using Centricon 30 (Amicon), and approximately one-fifth of the product was heat denatured and sequenced using a Sequenase kit (USE) and the protocol recommended by the supplier, with an internal primer, 5’.AATTGGCTTCTGAGGCTTCT-3’ to read the antisense direction and Y-GAGGTGGGGGTGGTCCTGGA3’ to read the sense direction (Sanger et al., 1977). Other exons were scanned for mutation by a stmilar method (A. I. M. et al., unpublished data). Acknowledgments We thank Dr. Jeffrey M.

Introduction The periodic paralyses are a group of neuromuscular diseases with overlapping clinical and electrophysiological features and include hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), hypokalemic periodic paralysis, and paramyotonia congenita (PC). Patients with these disorders share the common feature of episodic weakness. Some of these patients also demonstrate clinical and electrophysiological myotonia, a form of abnormal electrical activity consisting of repetitive action potentials on electromyography associated with delayed relaxation of muscle (Riggs and Griggs, 1979).  Attacks  of paralysis  and  myotonia  may  occur  sponta-  neously or may be precipitated by factors including exercise, alterations of extracellular potassium levels, and muscle cooling. The particular precipitants of attacks in patients are often useful in classifying such individuals clinically. For example, HYPP is one type in which potassium loading can precipitate attacks. Serum potassium levels may be normal or elevated during an attack, thus distinguishing such patients from those with hypokalemic periodic paralysis. PC is an autosomal dominant myotonic disorder characterized by cold-induced, prolonged, localized muscle contraction and weakness (Riggs and Griggs, 1979). Muscle activity aggravates the myotonia associated with PC (paradoxical myotonia), in contrast to the usual improvement with exercise seen in most myotonic disorders (classical myotonia). Most patientswithPCdemonstratesomedegreeofworsening of myotonia with potassium loading. Patients with PC may experience episodes of generalized weakness (periodic paralysis) unassociated with cold exposure. In the “pure” form of PC, these attacks of weakness areassociated with normo-or hypokalemia. However, there are patients with otherwise typical PC in whom attacks of generalized weakness can be precipitated by potassium loading (Riggs, 1988). Electrophysiological investigation of HYPP and PC muscle in vitro has demonstrated alteration of muscle membrane sodium conductance (Lehmann-Horn et al., 1981, 1987a, 1987b; Rude1 et al., 1989), suggesting that the molecular alteration may reside in a skeletal muscle sodium channel (NaCh) gene. This was supported by genetic linkage of SCN4A, the gene encoding the adult isoform of the NaCh a subunit, to HYPP (Fontaine et al., 1990; Pt%ek et al., 1991a; Ebers et al., 1991; Koch et al., 1991a) and PC (PtaEek et al., 1991b; Ebers et al., 1991; Koch et al., 1991b). An interesting potassium-sensitiveformof myotoniacongenitawithout periodic paralysis is also genetically linked to this locus (PtaEek et al., 1992). Identification of twodistinct mutations in SCN4A from HYPP patient DNA established SCN4A as the HYPP gene (Ptacek et al., 1991~; Rojas et al., 1991). The unique features of PC suggest that one or more mutations in SCNM, different from those causing HYPP, might be responsible for the disorder. Furthermore, identification of mutations in DNA from PC patients is required to demonstrate that SCN4A is the PC gene rather than a closely linked marker for another chromosome 17q gene. We therefore undertook a search for mutations in the human gene (SCN4A) that encodes the tetrodotoxin-sensitive adult skeletal muscle NaCh isoform (hSkM?), using singlestrand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis (Orita et al., 1989a, 1989b) in an attempt to demonstrate that PC results from molecular alterations in this protein.

SSCP Prtmers  PCR amplification of the three most 3’ exons of SCN4A was performed with four primer pairs. Na.f/Na.r and Nb.f/Nb.r were designed to allow amplification of the sequence of exon N that encodes S4-S6 of M&Ml domain 4; N-l.f/N-1.r and N-2.f/N-2.r were used to amplify D4iSl-S3 and the 3-4 interdomain, respectively. The sequence of these primers and their relationship to exons N-2, N-l, and N are shown.  multiple base changes in DNA fragments up to 400 bases in length (Orita et al., 1989a, 1989b). Sequence alterations are detected as shifts in electrophoretic mobility of single-strand DNA on nondenaturing acrylamide gels; the two complementary strands of a DNA segment usually resolve as two SSCP conformers of distinct mobilities. Base pair change variants are identified by differences in pattern among the DNAs of the sample set. SSCP has proven useful in the analysis of other disease-causing mutations, such as cystic fibrosis, neurofibromatosis type 1, familial polyposis, and HYPP, in which DNA sequence variations have been characterized successfully at the level of single base substitutions (Dean et al., 1990; Cawthon et al., 1990; Groden et al., 1991; Ptacek et al., 1991c). Results Evaluation of Patients PC patients in kindred 1637 have been reported previously (Rich, 1894; Ptdcek et al., 1991b). The affected individuals in this family have spontaneous episodic attacks of quadriparesis and myotonia that is provoked by muscle cooling. No potassium sensitivity has been reported by these patients, but formal potassium challenge has never been performed. Patients from kindred 1800 have been reported elsewhere (Riggs et al., 1977) and have similar cold-induced myotonia and attacks of periodic paralysis. Potassium loading in oneof these patients resulted in worsening of the myotonia but improvement of strength. Patients in kindred 1984 also have the pure form of PC with periodic paralysis and myotonia that is provoked by cooling. The patient whose DNA we studied has undergone a potassium challenge, which resulted in severe, generalized muscle stiffness and pain, a slight increase in myotonia, but no change in strength (Griggs, 1978). Partial Cenomic Organization of SCN4A Intron-exon boundaries in SCN4A were  determined  by sequencing genomic clone hlO.l (George et al., 1992a) with oligonucleotide primers designed from the cDNA sequence of hSkM7 (George et al., 1992b). Twelve exons encompassing codons 615-1837 and ranging in size from 54-2248 bp were defined in a region of approximately 20 kb. Three exons (enumerated in a 3’ to 5’ direction as N, 2248 bp; N-l, 270 bp; and N-2, 104 bp) contain the coding sequence corresponding to the carboxyl terminus, domain 4, and the interdomain 3-4 region. Four pairs of oligonucleotide primers (Figure 1) were designed for use in amplifying regions of these exons that encode domain 4 and the 3-4 interdomain. Identification of Nucleotide Alterations in PC Patient DNA The very high degree of conservation of DNA and amino acid sequence in the membrane-spanning segments of the NaCh and the presence of HYPP mutations in these regions led us toconcentrateour search for PC mutations in the repeat domains. Patients from all three PC families demonstrated aberrant conformers (Figure 2) when investigated with SSCP analysis with primer set Na.f/Na.r. No abnormalities were noted with SSCP using the remaining three primer sets (data not shown). The pattern of aberrant banding appeared similar in all three families studied, thus suggesting that all three families might have the same mutation. Alternatively, different mutations may yield the same aberrant bands if they alter the electrophoretie mobility similarly. The aberrant pattern seen in the three PC patients was not seen in the DNA of 106 unrelated, normal individuals whose DNA was evaluated by SSCP. Transmission of Disease Allele in PC Families The aberrant banding pattern was shown to cosegregate with the disease allele in kindreds 1637 and 1800. The aberrant conformers were present in all affected individuals in these families and in none of the unaffected family members (Figures 2a and 2b).

The first (Figure 3a) corresponds to the normal hSkM7 sequence. The second (Figure 3b), present in patient #I2088 from kindred 1637, demonstrates a C to T transition at position 4419 of hSkM1 (George et al., 199213). When read in frame, this represents a first position change resulting in substitution of an arginine by a cysteine residue. The third pattern (Figures 3c and 3d), in patient #I3195 from kindred 1800 and patient #I3688 from kindred 1984, revealed a G to A transition at position 4420 of hSkM7 (George et al., 1992b). When read in frame, this second position change leads to substitution of the same arginine residue by a histidine. The normal hSkMl and mutant DNA sequence in the region of the mutations are aligned in Figure 4. These alterations occur in the same codon encoding a highly conserved arginine residue in the fourth putative membranespanning segment (S4) of domain 4 (Figure 5). These nucleotide substitutions occurred within the context of a CpG dimer. The majority of methylation in human DNA occurs on the cytosine in CpG dimer sequences; this interferes with efficient correction of C to T transitions resulting from 5-methyl cytosine deamination. These sites are, therefore, potential hot spots for mutation in either strand (Barker et al., 1984). One of the two mutations already described in HYPP demonstrated a C toT transition (PtaCek et al., 1991c).  Figure hSkM7  4. Alignment of DNA and PC Mutants  Sequence  (bp4410-4430)  of Normal  Mutation PC 1 occurs in kindred 1637, and mutation PC 2 was found in kindreds 1800 and 1984. The CGT codon encoding the arginine at position 1448 in the normal sequence, along with the two mutant codons, is enclosed by the rectangle. In PC 1, a C to T transition was found in the first position of this codon, thus encoding a cysteine residue. In PC 2, a G to A transition is noted at the second position of this codon, thus encoding a histidine residue.  Discussion PC is a rare hereditary disease characterized by autosomal dominant transmission, myotonia that is accentuated by exposure to cold and worsened by exercise, and attacks of muscular weakness or flaccid paralysis that are induced by muscle cooling (Riggs and Griggs, 1979). Although often considered as a distinct clinical entity separate from the HYPPs, PC is now known to be one of a variety of related clinical syndromes including HYPP that are caused by structural lesions in the adult skeletal muscle voltagedependent NaCh. Voltage-dependent NaChs are intrinsic membrane proteins that consist of a single large polypeptidewith a molecular weight of -260,000, containing 1800-2000 aa and 25%-30% complex carbohydrate by weight. Within this large protein are four regions of internal homology, each encompassing 225-325 aa. Analysis of these repeat domains identifies at least six potential transmembrane helices at conserved locations in each domain. The most striking of these is the S4 helix, which contains a repeating (x-x-Arg/Lys) motif that results in the presence of a positively charged amino acid at every third position. This helix is thought to play a central role in voltage-dependent channel activation. While voltage-dependent NaChs from all species share a common architecture, there are multiple forms of NaChs that can be expressed in different tissues of a single species, or even at the same time within the same tissue (Barchi, 1987). These isoforms differ predominantly in the sequence of their amino and carboxyl termini and in the regions linking the internal repeat domains. At least six NaCh isoforms have been characterized in rat (Noda et al., 1986; Kayano et al., 1988; Trimmer et al., 1989; Rogart et al., 1989; Kallen et al., 1990), and the NaCh isoform expressed in human adult skeletal muscle (hSkM7) has recently been cloned and sequenced (George et al., 1992b). This channel isoform is the product of the SCN4A gene (George et al., 1991). In PC, cooling of skeletal muscle leads first to hyperexcitability and then, in some cases, to paralysis. In vitro, skeletal muscle from PC patients iselectrophysiologically normal at 37°C but depolarizes and be-  ;‘ ;, .  Figure  5.

This depolarization is associated with the appearance of an abnormally large membrane conductance to sodium ions that can be blocked by tetrodotoxin and presumably involves voltage-dependent NaChs. Support for a roleof NaChs in the pathogenesisof this disease has recently been provided by genetic analyses in which tight linkage was demonstrated between the expression of the PC phenotype in affected families and the presence of characteristic restriction fragment length polymorphisms at the adult skeletal muscle NaCh gene locus (Ptatek et al., 1991b; Ebers et al., 1991). We now confirm this role by documenting specific mutations that occur in the NaCh gene SCN4A in PC patient DNA. The occurrence of nucleotide sequence alterations in the adult skeletal muscle NaCh that cosegregate with the PC phenotype in three unrelated families and the absence of these abnormalities in 106 unrelated normal individuals argue that mutations in hSkM7 are the molecular basis for this syndrome in these families. Both of the abnormalities described here result in similar SSCP mobility shifts. They both occur in the codon encoding arginine 1448, a residue that lies  Paramyotonia 895  Congenita  PC Mutation PC Mutation HSkMl Human  1 2  cardiac  Ra:  Skeletal  Rat  Brain  Rat Brain Rat Bra111 Electroplax Drosophila  NaCh  muscle Type I Type 2 Type 3 Eel Para Locus  Mutations  qKYFVSPTLF L-L TRTARTGR qKYFVSPTL F Ih IVIRLARIGR qKYFVSPTLF R IRLARIGR qKYFfSPTLF R IRLARIGR qKYFVSPTLF R IRLARIGR eKYF"SPTLF R IRLARIGR eKYFVSPTLF R IRLARIGR eKYFVSPTLF R IRLARIGR eKYFVSPTLF R IRLARIaR eKYFVSPTL1 R r vRvAkvGR  l -  vr.RLIrGAKG VL~%LIrGAKG vLRLIrGAKG iLRLIrGAKG vLRLIrGAKG iLRLIkGAKG iLRLIkGAKG iLRLIkGAKG "LRLIraAKG "LRLvkGAKG  IRTLLFALMM IRTLLFALMM IRTLLFALMM IRTLLFALMM IRTLLFALMM IRTLLFALMM IRTLLFALMM IRTLLFALMM IRTLLFALMM IRTLLFALaM  m/s4 -  within the S4 segment of hSkM1 domain 4. This residue is absolutely conserved in all known NaCh sequences across highly divergent species (Figure 6). The mutations replace this arginine residue with either cysteine or histidine and therefore neutralize this highly conserved S4 positive charge (the charge on histidine [pKa = 61 will be dependent on its local environment, but is not likely to have a strong positive charge). The location of the two PC NaCh mutations is distinct from the two reported HYPP mutations (PtZek et al., 1991c; Rojas et al., 1991), and this molecular heterogeneity is likely to be responsible for differences in the clinical presentation of these two syndromes. The two hSkM1 mutations described in this paper probably do not account for all cases of PC, since we have been unable to detect the same SSCP abnormality in three other families with the same disease phenotype (unpublished data). Although the exact functional consequences of neutralizing arginine 1448 in hSkM7 can only be revealed by a detailed electrophysiologic study of the mutant channel itself, some insight can be gained from studies of the effects of S4 segment mutations in other voltage-dependent sodium and potassium channels. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments involving the S4 segment of the rat brain II NaCh and the Shaker B potassium channel support the hypothesis that this segment does act as the voltage sensor in the biophysical mechanism of activation (Stuhmer et al., 1989; Papazian et al., 1991). Substitution of a neutral amino acid for individual positively charged residuesinS4ofdomainsland2oftheratbrain Ilchannel decreases the steepness of the voltage dependence of activation and shifts the midpoint of the activation curve along the voltage axis (Stuhmer et al., 1989). Mutations neutralizing charges in the Shaker potassium channel S4 have a less predictable effect, but also shift both the slope of the activation curve and the location of the curve on the voltage axis. In addition, S4 mutations in the Shaker potassium channel indicate coupling between channel activation and inactivation. A characteristic of the PC phenotype is the presence of both cold-induced myotonia and intermittent weakness, suggesting that a single mutation near the amino terminus of the S4 helix of domain 4can, under different physiological circumstances, lead to either repetitive NaCh activation or failure of activation and  Figure 6.

Although repetitive activity could result from a shift in the voltage dependence either of activation to more negative potentials or of inactivation to more positive potentials, the persistent sodium currents reported in electrophysiological recordings from PC muscle (Lehmann-Horn et al., 1987b) suggest that channel inactivation may be the process that is primarily affected. It has been shown that failure of NaCh inactivation, even in a small percentage of the channel population, can lead to membrane depolarization, inactivation of the other normal NaChs, and muscle paralysis (Cannon et al., 1991). Given the effects of S4 mutations in Shaker, it is also possible that the mutations described here could affect both inactivation and activation. However, sincethese mutations insert different amino acids than the substitution studied at the comparable location in Shaker, this point can only be resolved through the study of the mutated PC channel expressed in vitro. The temperature sensitivity of symptoms is an interesting aspect of the PC phenotype, and we can speculate as to how this relates to NaCh defects. Structural changes due to the mutations reported here might alter the relative energy levels of various conformations associated with different NaCh gating modes. If the factors stabilizing such states differ in their entropic contributions between mutant and wild-type channels, changes in temperature may differentially affect the preferred channel conformation in each case, and lower temperatures might serve to stabilize the mutant channel in a state associated with an abnormal gating mode. This might be anticipated if, for example, hydrophobic interactions play a prominent role in stabilizing a particular conformation. Alternatively, the mutations may render the channel abnormally sensitive to other cellular processes that are themselves temperature sensitive, such as phosphorylation or G protein interaction. Ultimately, the correlation between the mutations described here and the pathophysiology of excitation in PC will require the expression and analysis of human skeletal muscle NaChs in which this mutation has been introduced. Experimental  Procedures  Identification of PC Patients PC patients with well-documented disease were identified through the Muscular Dystrophy Association clinics at the University of Utah, the University of Rochester, and the University  Neuron 896  of West Virginia. Each patient was examined by one of the authors (L. J. P., R. C. G., and J. E. R.). All family members, including unaffected individuals and spouses, were examined whenever possible. All human tissue samples used in this project were obtained with the approval of the Institutional Review Board at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center. Tissue Culture Epstein-Barr virus was used to transform lymphocytes from normal and PC individuals. These lymphoblastoid cell lines then were cultured at 37OC, 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgroi Mediatech) containing 1% Nutridoma (Boehringer Mannheim), 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), and 50 Ulmlgentamicin sulfate. Patient DNA was obtained directly from peripheral blood by phenol-chloroform extraction. PCR Amplification DNA samples were amplified for SSCP analysis using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (3 min at 94OC, 1 time; 1 min at 94OC, 1 min at annealing temperature, 1 min at 72OC, 30 times). The annealing temperature for each reaction was bT-8°C below the T, for the primers. The reaction mixture was made up of the following: 200 ng of DNA, 0.5 uM of each primer, 70 uM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCI,, 0.01% gelatin, 0.25 U of Taq polymerase, and 0.1 ul of [a-32P]dCTP (3000 Cilml) in a volume of 10 ~1. SSCP Gel Analysis PCR products were diluted in 50 ul of a mixture containing 0.1% SDSandlOmM EDTA. Fivemicrolitersofthismixturewasfurther diluted with 6 ul of running buffer (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol). Products were denatured at 94OC for 3 min and kept on ice until 3 ul of each sample was loaded onto 5% polyacrylamidegels. Twoconditions were run for each set of reactions: a 90 mM Tris-borate (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA gel at 4OC and a 90 mM Tris-borate (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol gel at room temperature. Electrophoresis was carried out for both conditions at a constant power of 40 W. After electrophoresis, gels were transferred to Whatmann 3MM paper and dried on vacuum slab dryers. Autoradiography with Kodak X-Omat AR film was performed with intensifying screens for 24-36 hr. Sequencing of SSCP Conformers Individual SSCP bands were cut directly from the dried gels, placed in 100 ul of distilled water, shaken for 30 min at room temperature, and centrifuged briefly. A 10 ul aliquot of this supernatant was used for PCR amplification with primers 5’upNa.f 3’ and 5’rpNa.r 3’ (up- and rp- represent the -2lM13 universal and reverse primer sequences, respectively). Reaction mixture was as follows: 0.5 uM of each primer, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCb, 0.01% gelatin, 2.5 nmol of dNTP mixture. Samples were vortexed, spun down, placed on ice, and overlayered with mineral oil. Two units of Taq polymerase were added to each reaction. Reactions were placed in a preheated DNA thermal cycler at 94OC and run with the following parameters: 94OC, 1 min; 55OC, 1 min; 72OC, 1 min (30 times). Amplified products were resolved on 4% agarose gels (Maniatis et al., 1982) and isolated from the gel with Geneclean (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA). These products were sequenced using the dideoxy termination method (Sanger et al., 1977), with fluorescently tagged Ml3 universal or reverse sequencing primers on an applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

Amyloid protein was transthyretin (TTR) related and the patients were heterozygous for the mutant gene encoding TTR with a single amino acid substitution of cysteine for tyrosine at position 114. This family originated in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan, and 12 of the 36 known members of six generations have been affected. The initial symptoms occurred in their thirties with the cardinal features of polyneuropathy, vitreous opacities and cardiac disease. Sensory neuropathy was severe in the lower limbs. Autonomic disturbances, especially postural hypotension, were the most debilitating to the patients. Amyloid deposits were detected widely in most organs except for the central nervous system. The duration from the onset of the disease to death was within 10 yrs. Heart failure caused by heavy amyloid deposits was the most common cause of sudden death.  INTRODUCTION  Among familial systemic amyloidoses, only type I familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) was known to exist in Japan in the past two decades (Araki et al., 1968; Kito et al., 1980). It is clinicopathologically identical with the disease first found in Portugal in 1952 (Andrade) and subsequently in many countries. The molecular basis of the disease is a single amino acid substitution of methionine for valine at position 30 of the transthyretin (TTR) molecule, TTRMet3° (Dwulet and Benson, 1983, 1984; Tawara et al., 1983; Saraiva et al., 1984). In 1990, we identified three additional mutations in the TTR gene from three different Japanese families with amyloid polyneuropathy, TTR Cysll \ TTRGI>r42 and TTRArB5° (Ueno et al., 1990a,b). Subsequently, we found three more mutants, TTRAr8i8 (Saeki etal, 1991), TTRnc50 and TTR1*1130 (unpublished data) in another three families, thereby giving evidence for the molecular heterogeneity of the Japanese FAP.

The grandfather reportedly suffered from visual cloudiness, fainting on standing and intractable diarrhoea. The proband's mother (TJI-4) had visual cloudiness, fainting and difficulty with urination. She died suddenly at the age of 50 yrs. The proband's brother (IV-1) suffered from visual cloudiness, marked weight loss and difficulty in urination. He died at the age of 49 yrs. Five other family members (III-5, 7; IV-3, 5, 10) were reportedly affected by this disease. Dysaesthesiae in the lower limbs, bowel and sphincter disturbances, and dizziness on standing occurred in their thirties. Three of them had visual cloudiness. All five died in their early forties. In 1970 the proband (IV-2) first visited Osaka University Hospital and we have examined three affected relatives (V-2, 6, 9) since then. The clinical and laboratory features are summarized in Table 1.

Case IV-2 This male proband developed visual cloudiness and then impotence, cold feet and orthostatic dizziness at the age of 39 yrs. Three years later, he began to experience vomiting, urinary incontinence, chronic constipation and muscular weakness in the lower limbs. On admission at the age of 42 yrs, his blood pressure was 132/90 lying and 94/64 standing, with a constant pulse rate of 82. Vitreous opacity was present in the right eye. Cardiomegaly was absent. The cranial nerves and upper limbs were unremarkable. He had moderately atrophic muscles in the distal part of the lower limbs. There were decreased light-touch pain and thermal senses in the lower limbs, more distally, while position and vibratory senses were slightly impaired below the ankles. The results of routine laboratory tests were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was normal except for increased protein (98 mg/dl). Valsalva manoeuvre produced no decrease in the heart rate. A cold test showed no increase in the heart rate. Noradrenaline infusion raised blood pressure from 118/78 to 180/122 and the heart rate from 84 to 140. Intravenous atropine infusion resulted in no increase in the heart rate. Sweating was markedly reduced on the surface of the legs and back. Cystometry revealed a neurogenic atonic bladder. Sural nerve biopsy showed depletion of nerve fibres, but Congo red staining was negative. Over the next 3 yrs, proprioception became markedly decreased below the knee and lost in the toes. He worked as a booking clerk until his sudden death at the age of 46 yrs. A limited autopsy elsewhere revealed gross cardiomegaly (500 g), but no myocardial infarction was found. Case V-6 This case was a nephew of the proband. He began to have difficulty in urination and became sexually impotent at the age of 34 yrs. Three years later, he experienced the first attack of syncope on standing, developed cold feet and burnt his leg without feeling pain. He also developed visual cloudiness in his left eye and chronic constipation. On admission at the age of 38 yrs, his blood pressure was 162/100 lying and 50/0 standing, with a constant pulse rate of 78. Vitreous opacity was present in the left eye. There was no abnormality in the upper limbs but moderately atrophic muscles were present in the distal part of lower limbs. Light-touch, pain and thermal senses were moderately impaired in the lower limbs, more distally but vibratory and position senses were normal. Valsalva manoeuvre produced little change in the  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/115/5/1275/322161 by Reprints Desk user on 17 July 2018  1278  S.

Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly. Sural nerve biopsy showed depletion of both myelinated and unmyelinated fibres, axonal degeneration and small deposits of Congo red-positive substances. He was able to walk with mechanical assistance until his sudden death at the age of 40 yrs.  TABLE 2.

At post-mortem, widespread amyloid deposits were found in the blood vessel walls and perivascular areas in virtually all organs except in the parenchyma of the brain and spinal cord. The leptomeninges of the spinal cord were thickened by massive amyloid deposits. Cardiac weight was 480 g and there was concentric hypertrophy of the myocardium with amyloid deposits (Fig. 2A,B,C). Amyloid was heavily deposited in the mucosa and submucosa of the stomach and small intestine. In the kidney, the perivascular space contained only slight amyloid deposits (Fig. 3A,B). In the autonomic nerves in the kidney, amyloid deposits were observed within the perineurium and epineurium (Fig. 4A,B). Case V-2 This case was also a nephew of the proband. He developed coldness of the legs and intermittent shooting pain in the posterior thighs at the age of 31 yrs and developed impotence, orthostatic dizziness and alternating diarrhoea and constipation with incontinence by the age of 35 yrs. On examination, he had orthostatic hypotension, slight muscle atrophy and decreased pain and thermal sensation distally in the legs. Vibratory and position senses were severely impaired only in the toes. The sural nerve and rectal biopsies showed slight amyloid deposits. There was decreased sweating in the lower limbs and autonomic function tests showed widespread disturbance of the autonomic nervous system (Table 3). During the next year, his symptoms worsened and he developed vitreous opacities and dysaesthesiae in the hands. The serum TTR level was low (8.5 mg/dl, normal range: 21 —43 mg/dl) and CSF protein was 71 mg/dl. He died suddenly at the age of 38 yrs. At autopsy, amyloid deposits were observed in the perivascular space of every organ studied, but not in the spinal cord. The brain was not examined. The sciatic nerve contained amyloid deposits which were also strained with anti-TTR serum (Fig. 5A,B). In the kidney, amyloid deposits were found only in the perivascular space. Case V-9 This case is a son of the proband's cousin. He noticed dizziness on standing at the age of 34 yrs, and then developed impotence, difficulty in urination, muscle weakness and dysaesthesiae in the thighs. At the age of 36 yrs, the examination revealed orthostatic hypotension, vitreous opacities, muscle atrophy and decreased touch and pain sensation distally in the legs. He had a clinical course similar to that of the previous three patients, and has been confined to a wheelchair since the age of 38 yrs. Sural nerve and gastric mucosa biopsies showed amyloid deposits. Laboratory findings were normal except for a low concentration of serum TTR (10 mg/dl) and elevated CSF protein (74 mg/dl). There was no elevation of the serum noradrenaline or adrenaline levels on standing. The pupils were unresponsive to tyramine but were dilated by adrenaline.

LABORATORY FINDINGS  Immunohistochemistry for amyloid deposition The tissue specimens were subjected to immunohistochemical staining with anti-TTR antiserum and 24 other antisera including immunoglobulin and Bence Jones protein (x and X chains), but amyloid deposits reacted only with anti-TTR antiserum (Figs 2, 4, 5). Amyloid fibrils, prepared from autopsied kidney tissue by the method of Costa et al. (1978), possessed 1TK by a double immunodiffusion assay (data not shown). Autonomic cardiovascular responses Orthostatic hypotension without increase in the heart rate and a lack of response of the blood pressure and heart rate to cold stimulation indicated that the cardiac sympathetic nervous system was predominantly affected. Decreased secretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline in response to postural changes confirmed sympathetic disturbance. R-R interval variations with posture, Valsalva manoeuvre and at forced respiration were abnormal, indicating impairment of the parasympathetic nervous system. Intravenous noradrenaline infusion caused abnormally high blood pressure. Intravenous atropine infusion failed to induce a significant increase of the heart rate.

Cerebrospinal fluid protein and serum TTR Cerebrospinal fluid and sera were analysed for albumin, IgG and TTR concentrations. All three proteins were reduced in the sera, while the total CSF protein increased as the disease process advanced (Table 2). Transthyretin in the CSF can be divided into two components. One is blood-CSF (B-CSF) barrier-dependent TTR, which can be estimated from the concentration of TTR in the serum and the concentration gradient (serum/CSF) of albumin. The other is B-CSF barrier-independent TTR, which can be calculated by subtraction of the B-CSF barrier-dependent TTR from the measured TTR (Weisner and Roethig, 1983). The barrier-dependent TTR was a minor component, but it increased gradually as the disease progressed. The B-CSF barrier-independent TTR decreased in parallel to the serum TTR.

DNA diagnosis of the mutant 777? We previously reported that two patients in this family (V-2, 6) were heterozygous for the TTRCysl14 gene (Ueno et ai, 1990a). Since then, one patient (V-9) and one asymptomatic person in this family were found, by nucleotide sequence analysis to have the mutant gene. As the single base change in the TTR gene did not produce a new restriction site, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis could not be used as a direct means of detecting this mutation. We used a modified oligonucleotide primer which was designed to create a new restriction site for the endonuclease Hgi AI in the gene fragments encoding a mutant allelic exon 4. Analysis of RFLP combined with polymerase chain reaction using this primer enabled us to detect the TTRCysl14 gene (Fig. 6). We have not carried out DNA analysis in other members of this family. DISCUSSION  The clinicopathological features of the cases presented here are characterized by early involvement of the autonomic and sensory nervous systems and carry certain similarities as well as dissimilarities with the type I FAP caused by the mutant gene encoding TTRMct3° which has been reported from three large foci in Portugal (Andrade et al.,  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/115/5/1275/322161 by Reprints Desk user on 17 July 2018  HEREDITARY AMYLOIDOSIS  1213  B FK3. 5.

Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of a mutant allelic fragment containing an A to G transition. The DNA sequence of the TTR gene and cDNA were based on the published data (Mita et al., 1984; Tsuzuki el al., 1985). A 28 nucleotide forward primer carrying a substitution of 6 for C (5'-TACACCATTGCCGCCCTGCTGAGCCC6T-3') and a 22 nucleotide backward primer (5'-ATTGTCTCTGCCTGGACTTCTA-3') were designed for amplification of the two different allelic fragments (197 bp) using the polyerase chain reaction. The normal one had a single base change (C to 6 ) , and the mutant one had to base changes (C to 6 and A to G). Only the latter allelic sequence could produce a new restriction site for the endonuclease Hgi AI (GTGCTC), and thereby the mutant allelic segment could be digested into two fragments (166 bp and 31 bp). The gel electrophoresis showed that the three patients (lane 1, Case V-2; lane 2, Case V-6; lane 3, Case V-9) and one of their relatives (lane 4) were heterozygous for Hgi AI site in the TTR gene, while normal controls had no Hgi AI site (lanes 5 and 6). The size marker <f> x 174/Hae III is shown in lane 7.  1952; Coutinho et al, 1980), Japan (Araki et al., 1968, 1980; Ikegawa et al., 1991) and Sweden (Andersson et al., 1970, 1976; Benson and Cohen, 1977). Age of onset, clinical course and sex ratio The mean age of onset for four patients was 34 yrs and the disease most probably started in their thirties in eight presumably affected cases, which is similar to those in the majority of type I FAP cases from Portugal (Coutinho et al., 1980) and Japan (Araki et al., 1980). However, the Swedish type I FAP occurred in the sixth decade (Andersson et al., 1970, 1976). Three of the four patients studied here suddenly died several years after the onset of symptoms without falling into cachexia. The eight presumably affected cases in the present family probably also died within 10 yrs of the onset of symptoms. On the other hand, the patients with type I FAP from Portugal, Japan and Sweden were frequently  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/115/5/1275/322161 by Reprints Desk user on 17 July 2018  HEREDITARY AMYLOIDOSIS  1285  emaciated, confined to bed and died within 10—15 yrs, although some patients lived for more than 30 yrs after the onset of symptoms. Since FAP presented here and type IFAP are transmitted by the autosomal dominant mode, it is expected to affect both sexes equally. However, the proportion of men to women was 2:1 both in our family with the TTRCys"4 gene and in the Swedish group with the TTRMcl30 gene (Andersson et al., 1976). It is known that the disease tends to manifest earlier in men than in women in the Japanese and Portuguese groups with the TTRMet3° gene (Coutinho et al., 1980; Kito et al., 1980). These findings suggest that there may be some sex-related factors which accelerate amyloid deposition. Initial symptoms Although the initial symptoms were different, the four patients studied here commonly developed both sensory and autonomic disturbances within 3 yrs after the onset. Onefifth of the Portuguese cases with type I FAP had sensory neuropathy of the lower limbs which was followed by autonomic dysfunction, while dysautonomia preceded the sensory symptoms in a quarter of the cases (Andrade, 1952). The initial symptoms in 50% of the cases with Japanese type I FAP in Kumamoto (Ikegawa et al., 1991) were sensory disturbances in lower extremities. The four patients studied here and six other cases in the present family had visual cloudiness due to vitreous opacities at an early stage. Vitreous opacities caused by amyloid deposits were reported in patients with hereditary amyloid poly neuropathy (Kaufman, 1958; Kaufman and Thomas, 1959) and were seen in the advanced Portuguese cases (Coutinho et al., 1980), but not in the 375 patients in the Japanese series of type I FAP (Araki et al., 1980). The prevalence of vitreous opacities in the Swedish type I FAP patients was about 10% (Sandgren et al., 1990). The presence of vitreous opacities is one of the cardinal manifestations in three other kindreds: the Jewish type with TTRDe33 (Pras et al., 1983; Nakazato et al., 1984); the type E FAP with TTR**84 (Rukavina etai, 1956; Nichols etal, 1989); the Italian FAP cases with TTRAla49 (Salvi etal, 1991). Peripheral nerve involvement In our patients, sensory impairment began in the distal part of the lower limbs and progressed in an ascending fashion. It was mild in the upper limbs even in the advanced stage. Severe impairment of temperature and pain sensations developed at the early stage, but vibratory and position senses were far less impaired even at the advanced stage. This pattern has commonly occurred in type I FAP. It has been suggested that preferential loss of unmyelinated and small myelinated axons correlated with the selective impairment of pain and temperature sensations as well as autonomic function (Dyck and Lambert, 1969; Thomas and King, 1974). Lumbar pain, Lasegue's sign and segmental sensory loss appeared in our patients at an early stage. These signs and symptoms suggested the involvement of the proximal part of peripheral nerves. In fact, the post-mortem examination showed massive amyloid deposits in the proximal portion of the sciatic nerve even in the cases with minimal deposits in the sural nerve. Hanyu et al. (1989) reported heavy amyloid deposition in the proximal portion of the sciatic nerve in autopsied cases of type I FAP, but amyloid deposition was scanty in the sural nerve in spite of the total loss of myelinated nerve  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/115/5/1275/322161 by Reprints Desk user on 17 July 2018  1286  S. UENO AND OTHERS  fibres. Sobue et al. (1990) also observed prominent amyloid deposits in the dorsal root ganglia, sympathetic ganglia and the most proximal part of the nerve fibres. All these findings support the notion that amyloid deposits in the most proximal portion of the nerve trunk are important in the pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathy in FAP and may be the cause of occasional failure to detect amyloid deposits in the sural nerve as we experienced in Case FV-2. Motor function was affected much less than the autonomic and sensory functions in our patients. Conduction velocities of the motor nerves were only slightly reduced even in the absence of evoked responses in the sensory nerves. Motor nerve function was also better preserved in type I FAP in comparison to sensory nerve function. One possible explanation is the difference in the degree of neural sprouting, since the axonal sprouts were not prominent in the dorsal roots in spite of the severe fibre loss, while they were significant in the ventral spinal roots (Sobue et al., 1990). The mechanism for precipitation of variant TTR in the endoneurial space and its relation to nerve fibre generation is uncertain. Andrade (1952) reported that in type I FAP neuronal damage preceded amyloid deposition, suggesting that neuropathy was due to metabolic derangement. However, Sobue et al. (1990) demonstrated a parallel between the distribution of amyloid deposits and neuronal changes, suggesting that the physical influence of the deposited amyloid fibrils was harmful to the nerve rather than the soluble variant TTR itself. Autonomic disturbances In the four patients presented here, autonomic dysfunction occurred at an early stage and posed a more serious problem for management than the sensory neuropathy, since it was intractable and restricted ambulation. Falcao de Freitas et al. (1980) reported disturbance of the cardiovascular autonomic system in the Portuguese patients with type I FAP including postural hypotension, a low plasma level of noradrenaline both in the supine and standing position, and a blunt response of the heart rate to atropine and Valsalva manoeuvre. All or most of these abnormalities also existed in our patients. The result of the Valsalva manoeuvre indicated impairment of the vagal efferent pathway. The negligible effect of atropine reinforced this conclusion. Administration of noradrenaline led to excessive increases in the heart rate and blood pressure, suggesting denervation hypersensitivity of the a-adrenergic nervous system caused by presynaptic nerve degeneration. However, one must be cautious in interpretation of the responsiveness of the heart rate to various stimuli in the presence of cardiomyopathy. Chronic digestive symptoms such as nausea, diarrhoea and constipation might have been caused by massive amyloid deposition in the intestinal tract as detected by the histopathologic examination. Central nervous system There were no clinical signs suggestive of central nervous system (CNS) involvement and no amyloid deposits were found in the autopsied brains. Some Japanese patients with TTR "^-related FAP showed cerebellar ataxia and pyramidal tract signs (Ikeda et al., 1987), but these patients apparently had two independent diseases, type I FAP and a spinocerebellar degneration (Ikeda et al., 1991).

Cardiac amyloidosis is classified into two types (Coelho and Pimental, 1961); disturbance of rhythm/conduction and congestive heart failure. Our patients showed no clinical sign of heart failure in the early or middle stage, but low voltage and myocardial ischaemic patterns strongly suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis were recorded with the electrocardiogram. Conduction and rhythm abnormalities were mild. In the advanced stage, echocardiogram showed abnormal thickening of both left and right ventricular walls and amyloid cardiomyopathy was confirmed at autopsy in three cases. Renal involvement The intensity of amyloid deposition and renal insufficiency may differ considerably even among patients with the mutant gene encoding TTRMet3° (Andrade, 1952; Silvia Horta et al., 1964; Andersson et al., 1970, 1976; Hofer and Anderson, 1975; Benson and Cohen, 1977; Ikeda et al., 1987). Our deceased patients (Cases IV-2, V-2, V-6) had well preserved renal function and one patient (Case V-9) has not shown signs of nephropathy. There were only small amounts of amyloid deposits in the perivascular area and rarely in the cortex and medulla at autopsy. Low serum TTR and elevated CSF protein levels Serum TTR levels were reduced in our patients. Low TTR levels were also present in Japanese type I FAP (Shoji and Nakagawa, 1988), Portuguese type I FAP and Indian Maryland FAP (Benson and Dwulet, 1983). Although the mechanisms for the reduction of serum TTR is not certain, TTR synthesis was unlikely to be reduced since the TTR mRNA level in livers of patients with FAP was not appreciably different from controls (Mita et al., 1986). A major proportion of TTR in the CSF is produced in the choroid plexus. The release of TTR from the choroid plexus was enhanced in the Japanese patients with type I FAP (Mita et al., 1986). However, the level of the B-CSF barrier independent TTR in CSF gradually declined in our patient (Case V-6) over 2 yrs. The latter may be explained by consumption of TTR in the intrathecal space as amyloid fibrils, or by compensatory enhancement of TTR synthesis in the choroid plexus at an early stage. The kindred presented here originated in the Kunimi, Nagasaki Prefecture, but no focus has been located there. This mutation may occur less frequently than the TTRMa3° mutation or it might have occurred in the relatively recent past. The patients presented here, though genetically different, were not clinically distinct from the patients with TTRMct30-related type I FAP because of the considerable clinical heterogeneity of the latter reported from many countries. Further studies of a large series of patients over a long period are necessary to ascertain the relationship between the gene mutation and clinical phenotypic expression.

The mouse mutation Small eye (Sey), which has been proposed as a model for aniridia, results from defects in Pax-6, a gene containing paired-box and homeobox motifs that is specifically expressed in the developing eye and brain. To test the role of PAX6 in aniridia, we isolated human cDNA clones and determined the intron-exon structure of this gene. PAX6 spans 22 kilobases and is divided into 14 exons. Analysis of DNA from 10 unrelated aniridia patients revealed intragenic mutations in three familial and one sporadic case. These findings indicate that the human aniridia and murine Small eye phenotypes arise from homologous defects in PAX6."

Soutar MRC Lipoprotein Team, Hammersmith Hospital, Ducane Road, London W12 OHS, England  -  Supplementary key words polymerase chain reaction LDL receptor structure population screening  analysis  mismatch  Mutations in the gene for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor cause the autosomal dominant inherited disease familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), which affects approximately one in 400 individuals in most populations. The LDL receptor is a cell-surface glycoprotein that mediates the specific uptake and catabolism of plasma LDL, and heterozygous FH individuals with one defective gene have a markedly raised plasma cholesterol that  is frequently associated with the occurrence of tendon xanthomata, accelerated atherosclerosis, and premature coronary heart disease. Homozygous FH patients are more severely affected and, without intensive cholesterollowering treatment, rarely reach the age of maturity (1). Much has already been learned about the relationship between structure and function of the different domains of the LDL receptor protein from studies of receptor function in cultured skin fibroblasts of FH patients with known mutations in the gene (2). A variety of different types of mutations have been characterized, including major gene rearrangements, small deletions, and point mutations, but with a few notable exceptions each of these has been observed in a single individual or family. The exceptions are cases where a founder gene in an isolated population has resulted in a higher than usual frequency of FH in which most of the patients have the same mutation. By contrast, in populations of very diverse ethnic origins, it has been estimated that more than 183 different mutant alleles of the LDL receptor gene may be responsible for FH (2). Nonetheless, while more restricted populations may not demonstrate the presence of a clear founder gene, a smaller number of mutations may be responsible for the disease in the majority of patients, so that a DNAbased diagnostic test would be feasible. Identification of the specific mutation in the gene of an FH patient not only sheds further light on the way the LDL receptor functions in vivo, information that may also be relevant to other cell-surface receptor proteins, but will also allow comparisons to be made between groups of patients with either the same or different mutations in the gene.

In this report we describe the characterization of two new mutations in the LDL receptor gene of an F H homozygote patient of English origin. One of the mutations is very common in the English population, particularly in the north of England, while the other is uncommon, but probably originates from Ireland.  METHODS  Subjects  Analysis of DNA Genomic DNA was isolated as described previously (5) or by a rapid small scale method (4). Southern blotting was carried out by standard techniques (6) described in detail elsewhere (3). To detect major rearrangements in the LDL receptor gene, genomic DNA (10 pg) was digested either with PvuII or BglII and fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. After blotting, the PvuIIdigested DNA was hybridized with a 1.9-kb BamHI fragment derived from the 3' end of the cDNA for the LDL receptor (plasmid pLDLR3, kindly supplied by Dr. D. Russell, Dallas, Texas). The BglII-digested DNA was hybridized with a 1.7-kb HndIWBglII probe derived from the 5' end of the cDNA, then stripped and re-probed with a 0.7-kb fragment encompassing exon 1 and the promoter region of the gene (7). The probe for the promoter region was prepared by PCR amplification of genomic DNA from a normocholesterolemic individual with oligonucleotide primers located in the intron adjacent to the 3' end of exon 1 and at bases -621 to -601 upstream from the AUG initiator codon (7). Probes were labeled with 32Pby random primed synthesis (8).  Detection of point mutations by mismatch analysis Twelve fragments of the LDL receptor gene comprising individual exons (exons 1, 2, 3, 4, 15, and 18) or pairs of exons with the intravening intron (exons 5 + 6, 7 + 8, 9 + 10, 11 + 12, 13 + 14, 16 + 17) were amplified by the  690  Journal of Lipid Research  Volume 33, 1992  Detection of mutations by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization Duplicate samples of amplified fragments of genomic DNA (usually 5 p1 PCR reaction mix) were fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to duplicate nylon membranes (Biodyne A, Gallenkamp) by capillary blotting in 15 x SSC (6) for 1 h. The membranes were prehybridized for at least 30 min at 37OC in hybridization buffer (5 x SSPE, 5 x Denhardts, 0.5% w/v SDS (6)) and then one of the duplicate membranes hybridized with 1-5 x lo5 cpm/ml of each of the pair of allele-specific 32Plabeled oligonucleotides for 1 h at 37OC. Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with gamma-32P-ATP by incubation with T 4 polynucleotide kinase (6). After hybridization,  Downloaded from www.jlr.org by guest, on October 11, 2012  The proband is a boy of English origin who was given a clinical diagnosis of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia at 1% years of age, based on a markedly increased concentration of plasma cholesterol (30 mmol/l), the presence of tendon xanthomata, and a family history of premature coronary disease and hypercholesterolemia. There was no evidence for consanguinity in the family. The two samples of FH patients, 200 attending lipid clinics in the London area and 77 attending a lipid clinic in Manchester, have been described in detail elsewhere (3, 4).  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (9) essentially as described previously ( 5 ) with oligonucleotide primers located in the adjacent introns (10); sequences containing a recognition site for the enzyme Sal1 were included at the 5' end of each oligonucleotide. The amplified fragment containing exon 1 also contained the adjacent 5' region of the gene, as described above. Differences between the sequence of the amplified LDL receptor gene fragments from the proband and that from a normal control subject were detected by chemical cleavage of modified mismatched heteroduplexes, as described by Montandon and coworkers (11). The following modifications were used. The control DNA used as the probe was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis on 1.5% NuSieve gels (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) before labeling. The fragment was recovered from the excised agarose by extraction with phenol (6) and labeled with 32P either by end-filling the Sal1 digested-fragment, which labels the 3' end, or by incubation with T 4 polynucleotide kinase, which labels the 5' end (6). For the formation of heteroduplexes, 50-100 ng of labeled probe DNA was hybridized with a 5- to 10-fold excess of the unlabeled PCR product from the proband. To ensure that mismatches close to the ends of the fragments were detected, each amplified fragment from the proband was analyzed for mismatches with both a 3'-end-labeled probe and a 5'-end-labeled probe. PCR products from the proband were purified with Geneclean (Stratagene Ltd., UK) for mismatch analysis. To increase recovery of the final cleaved heteroduplexes, glycogen (20 pg) was added as carrier for the final ethanol precipitation. The DNA sequence of PCR products was determined directly by the Sequenase method (USB, Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge, UK) with the modifications described by Casanova et al. (12) after purification of the DNA fragment by agarose gel electrophoresis as described above, Unless otherwise stated, primers for sequencing were the same as one of those used for PCR amplification of the fragment.  the membranes were washed three times for 10 min each at ambient temperature in 5 x SSPE, 0.1% w/v SDS and then for 20 min in the same buffer at the stringent wash temperature. The oligonucleotides for the detection of the gluso lys mutation were 5'-GCTCAGACGAGCAAGGC (normal) and 5'-GCTCAGACAAGCAAGGC; the stringent wash temperature was 48OC. The oligonucleotides for the detection of the deletion in exon 15 were 5'-GTGGAGATAGTGACAAT (normal) and 5'GGTGGAGATGTGACAAT the stringent wash temperature was 42OC. +  Haplotype analysis  Cultured cells  RESULTS  Skin fibroblasts from explants obtained by biopsy of the proband and his parents were maintained in culture as previously described (18). Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from fibroblasts that had been incubated for 12-16 h with medium containing lipoprotein-deficient serum (19) and fragments of the LDL receptor mRNA comprising exons 1-4 (500 bp), 12-15 (500 bp), and 15-18 (400 bp) of the gene were amplified by PCR with oligonucleotide primers located in the appropriate exons as described previously (20). Methods for the immunoprecipitation of ?+labeled LDL receptor protein from cultured cells have been described previously (21). For immunoblotting, cells were harvested and solubilized as described by van Driel and coworkers (22), and the proteins were separated and detected with specific monoclonal antibodies to the LDL receptor as described before (23).  Site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression of LDL receptors in heterologous cells The gluso Lys mutation was introduced into plasmid pLDLR4, a mammalian expression vector containing the human LDL receptor DNA under transcriptional control of the SV40 promoter (kindly provided by Dr. D. Russell, Dallas, Texas). A fragment of the LDL receptor cDNA, XbaI-EcoRI, was cloned into M13 mp18 and the mutation was introduced into single-stranded DNA by standard techniques (Amersham International, oligonucleotide directed in vitro mutagenesis system). Mutant M13 plaques were identified by hybridization with the mutant oligonucleotide under stringent conditions, and +  Webb et al.  The members of the family of the proband with a raised plasma cholesterol or premature C H D are shown in Fig. 1. The details of the plasma lipid values in the proband and his immediate family are shown in Table 1. Southern blotting of genomic DNA isolated from the proband, his parents, and his sister did not reveal any major abnormalities in the LDL receptor genes of the family. Fragments of the gene comprising single exons, exon 1 together with the promoter region, or pairs of exons were amplified by PCR with oligonucleotide primers located in the adjacent introns. With one exception, the size of the fragments obtained from the proband were as expected from the published structure of the gene (7). When exons 9 and 10 were amplified together as a single fragment, the size of the PCR product was 0.52 kb instead of the expected 1.3 kb. However, amplification of genomic DNA from 10 normal control individuals also produced a product of 0.52 kb. Restriction enzyme mapping, sequencing, and hybridization with specific probes confirmed that this fragment comprised exons 9 and 10 together with an intron of 0.09 kb rather than one of 0.9 kb as reported (7). Since we have never observed the presence of a larger intron of 0.9 kb in the amplified fragment comprising exons 9 and 10, it is possible that the size of this intron reported in the earlier paper was not correct. The absence of any gross abnormalities in the LDL receptor genes of the proband suggested that both mutant alleles contained point mutations or minor rearrangements. To detect these minor differences in gene sequence, the amplified fragments of the LDL-receptor  Two new English mutations in the LDL receptor gene  691  Downloaded from www.jlr.org by guest, on October 11, 2012  The genotype of the LDL receptor gene was determined at four variable restriction enzyme sites, those for SfaNl in exon 2 (13), AvaII in exon 13 (14), PvuII in intron 15 (15), and Ncol in exon 18 (16). The PvuII polymorphism was detected by Southern blotting described above, and the remainder was detected by PCR amplification of genomic DNA and restriction enzyme digestion or hybridization with allele specific oligonucleotides as described previously (5, 17).  the presence of the mutation in the otherwise unchanged insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant fragment was excised from the replicative form of the M13 and cloned into pLDLR4 using standard techniques (6). Stocks of monkey COS cells were maintained in culture in DMEM medium with high glucose (Gibco Europe Ltd.) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 p/ml), and streptomycin (100 pg/ml). For transfection, cells were seeded on day 1 at 5.5 x lo5 cellddish in 9-cm diameter dishes (Nunc Gibco Europe Ltd.) in the same medium. O n day 2, cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and incubated in 9 ml serum-free medium for 30 min before transfection. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA (10 pg/dish) by the standard calcium phosphate method as described by Gorman (24) and then incubated for 48 h in DMEM containing high glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin to allow expression of LDL receptors. Cell extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with 1251-labeledantiLDL-receptor antibody 10A2 as described above.  I  '231 4  5  6  7 8  I  I  9 10 1 1 12 1314 15 16  Fig. 1.

Thus the proband, although apparently homozygous, is a compound heterozygote with two different mutant alleles for the LDL receptor gene. This was confirmed by haplotype analysis based on four informative restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) sites in the four members of the family. As shown in Fig. 4a, the allele carrying the deletion in exon 15 is characterized by the absence of the cutting sites for SfaNl in exon 2, PvuII in intron 15, AvaII in exon 13, and Ncol in exon 18, while that carrying the mutation in exon 3 is characterized by the presence of the cutting sites for SfaN1, AvaII, and Ncol, and the absence of the cutting site for PvuII. The presence of both point mutations was readily detected by hybridization of the appropriate amplified fragment of genomic DNA with specific oligonucleotides under stringent conditions, as shown in Fig. 4b and c. Extracts of cultured skin fibroblasts from the proband and his parents were electrophoresed on nonreduced polyacrylamide gels containing SDS, followed by immunoblotting with specific monoclonal antibodies to the LDL receptor. As shown in Fig. 5A, the LDL receptor  gene from the proband were subjected to chemical mismatch analysis with probe fragments derived from a normocholesterolemic subject. Extra bands that were not detected in either the untreated probe DNA or in a normal control sample were present in the amplified fragments of exon 3 and exon 15 (Fig. 2). In all other fragments, no extra bands were seen that were not due to known polymorphic sites present in exons. Direct sequencing of the purified amplified fragments revealed that the proband was heterozygous for a single base substitution of A for G in exon 3 that changes the codon for amino acid residue 80 in the mature protein from GAG (glutamic acid) to AAG (lysine), and for a single base pair deletion of an A residue in the coding strand for exon 15. The deletion results in a frameshift that changes the codon for amino acid residue 743 in the mature protein from ATA (isoleucine) to ATG (methionine) and introduces a termination codon in the adjacent position (Fig. 3). Amplification and sequencing of fragments of genomic DNA from the parents and sibling of the proband showed that the father and sister were heterozygous for the mutation in exon 3, while exon 3 in the mother was normal, and that the mother was heterozygous for the sin-  I  4298  -  75  AExon3  Downloaded from www.jlr.org by guest, on October 11, 2012  laneno.12345 probe cexm3-+  probably represents a breakdown product of the LDL receptor (25).

In contrast, when extracts of cells from the proband that had been incubated with [JSSlmethionine were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies to the LDL receptor protein and fractionated on reduced polyacrylamide gels containing SDS, bands were detected that corresponded only to the precursor form and the mature form of the normal LDL receptor protein and no slowly migrating band was observed (Fig. 5B).

The four variable restriction enzyme sites in the LDL receptor gene that were analyzed in this study are shown at the top of the figure. The vertical numbered bands represent the 18 exons in the LDL receptor gene. The genotype ofeach member of the R family (identified by initials as shown on the pedigree, (a)) based on these variable restriction enzyme sites was determined as described in Methods.

The haplotype of the allele carrying the deletion in exon 15 is SfaNl-. AvaII -, PvuII -, Ncol-. For detection of the mutations by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, the appropriate fragment of genomic DNA was amplified by PCR, applied to a nylon membrane in duplicate wells of a slot blotting apparatus (b), or fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred in duplicate to a nylon membrane by capillary blotting (c).

When the amplified fragment containing the polymorphic AvaII site in exon 13 was digested with AvaII (Fig. 7A), the majority of the fragment from the proband’s mRNA was cleaved, suggesting that it was derived mainly from the allele inherited from his father (AvaII + ) and not from the allele inherited from his mother (AvaII-). By comparison with results obtained when mixtures of different proportions of the fragments from the parents were analyzed, it was estimated that the mRNA derived from the maternal allele comprised approximately 10% of the total LDL receptor mRNA in the cells from the proband (Fig. 7B). Part of an amplified genomic fragment containing the promoter region, comprising approximately 250 base pairs upstream from exon 1, was also sequenced for each member of the family and found to be identical with the normal sequence (data not shown).

The presence of the mutation in samples that gave a positive si,gnal with either of the mutant oligonucleotides was confirmed by DNA sequencing. In the London sample, five individuals were found to carry the gluao lys mutation; in three of these the haplotype of the mutant allele based on four RFLPs was determined unambiguously by comparing DNA from the patient with that of affected and unaffected relatives, and was found to be the same as that in the proband and his father (Table 2). In the Manchester sample, eleven unrelated individuals were found with the gluao lys mutation but relatives of the majority of these patients were not available for haplotype analysis. The single base pair deletion in exon 15 found in the proband and his mother was not detected in any unrelated patients in the Manchester sample, or any patients in the London sample. +  +  Webb et a/.

A: Extracts of cultured skin fibroblasts from the proband (MR). his father OR),and mother (AB). and a normocholesterolaemic subject (Nor) that had been preincubated for 40 h in medium containing lipoprotein-deficient serum were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on nonreduced .VIS (7.5%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described in Methods. Membranes were incubated with an lzsI-labeled monoclonal antibody to the bovine LDL receptor (antibody 10A2) and then subjected to autoradiography for 60 h at -7OOC with preflashed film. "Rand X" probably represents a minor breakdown product of the normal receptor protein (25). R: Cultured skin fibroblasts that had been preincubated for 16 h with lipoprotein-deficient serum were incubated for 2 h with methionine-free medium containing [35S]methionine. Extracts of cells were immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody to the bovine LDL receptor and the immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PACE on gels (7.5%) containing 2-mercaptoethanol. The dried gel was subjected to autoradiography for 40 h at -70OC with preflashed film.  Two new point mutations in the LDL receptor gene have been detected in a homozygous FH patient of English origin. The technique for mismatch analysis to detect point mutations was essentially that described by Montandon and coworkers (ll), but an essential modification was included for the analysis of larger DNA fragments, in that the mismatch was carried out twice, once with the probe DNA labeled at the 3' end and once with a probe labeled at the 5' end. In this way it was ensured that mismatches close to one and of a fragment would be readily detected by the presence of small cleavage products, as well as by large cleavage products that did not separate well from the excess labeled probe DNA. The mutant allele inherited by the proband from his mother has a single base pair deletion that introduces a new termination codon in the 0-linked sugars domain of the LDL receptor, but no truncated protein could be detected in cultured skin fibroblasts from the proband or his  +dimer?

The glu80 lys mutation was introduced into the LDL receptor cDNA in a mammalian expression vector, plasmid pLDLR4, by site-directed mutagenesis. The presence of the mutation in the cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the entire LDL receptor cDNA. The plasmids containing either the normal LDL receptor (pLDLR4) or the mutant LDL receptor (pLDLR4-JR) cDNA were transfected into monkey COS cells, and the cells were incubated for 48 h to allow transient expression of the plasmid.

Premature termination codons introduced by mutation into the P-globin gene are known to destablize the mRNA in some cases (30), and cells carrying either of the two alleles described above in which stop codons have been introduced also appear to contain less mRNA than normal (31). The mutant allele inherited by the proband and his sibling from their father has a single base change that would be expected to cause the glutamic acid residue at position 80 in the mature protein to be substituted with lysine. This residue occurs in the second disulfide-rich repeat in the binding domain of the receptor protein, and affects processing and intracellular transport of the newly synthesized protein. It also results in a mature protein that migrates abnormally slowly on nonreduced gels, although the protein migrates normally when fully reduced. A similar phenotype was observed when a plasmid containing an LDL receptor cDNA with the mutation was expressed in COS cells. The normal LDL receptor  mother with specific antibody to the LDL receptor. One of the antibodies used for immunoblotting was antireceptor I$-C7 (26) that apparently recognizes an antigenic site in the first disulfide-rich repeat in the binding domain of the protein and should be able to detect a putative truncated receptor with the first three domains intact (27). In cells with the Lebanese allele of the LDL receptor gene, in which a point mutation introduces a stop codon in exon 14, a truncated protein is synthesized but is present in cells at a very low level (28). However, two other mutant alleles into which a stop codon has been introduced by a frameshift, caused either by an insertion in exon 8 (2) or by a 4 kb deletion between exons 12 and 15 (29). produce no detectable LDL receptor protein. Cultured cells from the proband contained only a small amount of mRNA derived from this allele, suggesting that the mRNA is unstable in the cells. There was no evidence for any mutation in the putative promoter region that would affect the rate of transcription, but we cannot rule out the existence of an additional mutation in some cis-  Webb et ai.  mutation also occurs in other FH patients in Ireland or in Irish-Americans in the United States; it does not appear to be widespread in the two populations described in this study, unlike the mutation present in exon 3.

These data suggest that the normal formation of disulfide bonds in the second repeat may be impeded in this mutant protein. The gluso to lys mutation was also found in five unrelated individuals in a sample of 200 patients with a clinical diagnosis of FH who were attending lipid clinics in the London area. Haplotype analysis of the mutant alleles was possible in some cases and showed that it was likely that all the patients had inherited the same mutant allele, although the observed haplotype, based on four RFLP sites in the gene, is relatively common in this population (32, 33). The data of Leitersdorf, Chakravarti, and Hobbs (32) suggest that little additional information would be gained by analysis of the other common polymorphic sites in the LDL receptor gene, for example those for ApaLl or SphI, because of linkage disequilibrium with the RFLP sites already analyzed. Two of the patients with the gluso to lys mutation were originally from the northwest of England, one from the Midlands, one from the southeast, and the other a first generation immigrant from Ireland. Perhaps more striking was the frequency of this mutation in the FH.patients attending a lipid clinic in Manchester, where it was found in 11 out of 77 unrelated patients. It was not possible to determine the haplotype of the mutant allele in these patients, but their genotype at the LDL receptor locus was compatible with them all having inherited the same mutant allele. Since the family of the proband’s father are from Lancashire, it is proposed that the g1us0 to lys mutation should be named FH Lancashire according to the nomenclature of Hobbs and coworkers (2). The frequency of this mutation in English FH patients and its presence in Irish patients suggests that it might also be found in individuals of English or Irish origin in the United States. In marked contrast, the mutation in the gene inherited by the proband from his mother was not detected in any unrelated patients in the Manchester sample or in any individuals in the London sample. The DNA sequence in which the deletion occurs is CACCACGGTGGAGATaGTGACAATGT, where the deleted base is indicated by the lower case letter, which contains several elements associated with the frequent occurrence of deletions in other genes (34). In particular, it contains a sequence identical to a consensus sequence (underlined in the sequence above) derived from sequences in other genes that have been identified as ‘deletion hot spots’, where multiple small deletions have occurred at the same sites in the human genome (34). The family of the proband‘s mother is of Northern Irish origin, and we propose that this mutation should be named FH Tyrone according to the nomenclature of Hobbs and coworkers (2). It will be of interest to determine whether this  8. Feinberg, A. P., and B. Vogelstein. 1984. A technique for radiolabeling DNA restriction endonuclease fragments to high specific activity. Anal.

"1","The Indiana kindred variant of Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease has amyloid plaques that contain prion protein (PrP), but is atypical because neurofibrillary tangles like those of Alzheimer disease are present. To map the position of the disease causing gene, we used three markers for linkage analyses. A missense mutation at codon 198 of the PrP gene (PRNP) is found in all definitely affected individuals and yields a maximum lod score of 6.37 (theta = 0). The disease also is concordant with the two other PRNP-region markers. These results demonstrate tight linkage of the disease-causing gene to PRNP and support the hypothesis that the codon 198 mutation is the cause of IK-GSS. Our studies also suggest that methionine/valine heterozygotes at PRNP codon 129 have a later age of onset of the disease than codon 129 valine/valine homozygotes.Linkage of the Indiana kindred of Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease to the prion protein gene.© 1992 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/naturegenetics  © 1992 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/naturegenetics  © 1992 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/naturegenetics  © 1992 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/naturegenetics  "

A leucine substitution at PrP codon 102 has been genetically linked to GSS in some families. We examined the PrP gene in these families. A serine for phenylalanine substitution was found at codon 198 in the Indiana patients; arginine for glutamine substitution at codon 217 in the Swedish patients.

Koch, Klaus Steinmeyer, Claudius Lorenz, Kenneth Ricker, Friedrich Wolf, Michael Otto, Barbara Zoll, Frank Lehmann-Horn, Karl-Heinz Grzeschik, Thomas J. Jentsch* Autosomal recessive generalized myotonia (Becker's disease) (GM) and autosomal dominant myotonia congenita (Thomsen's disease) (MC) are characterized by skeletal muscle stiffness that is a result of muscle membrane hyperexcitability. For both diseases, alterations in muscle chloride or sodium currents or both have been observed. A complementary DNA for a human skeletal muscle chloride channel (CLC1) was cloned, physically localized on chromosome 7, and linked to the T cell receptor p (TCRB) locus. Tight linkage of these two loci to GM and MC was found in German families. An unusual restriction site in the CLC-1 locus in two GM families identified a mutation associated with that disease, a phenylalanine-to-cysteine substitution in putative transmembrane domain D8. This suggests that different mutations in CLC-1 may cause dominant or recessive myotonia.  Autosomal recessive generalized myotonia (GM) is a nondystrophic disorder of skeletal muscle and was clinically separated (1) from autosomal dominant myotonia congenita (MC) (1, 2). In GM, myotonic stiffness starts in early childhood in the legs. It progresses for some years, affecting the arms, neck, and facial muscles. After the patient reaches approximately 20 years of age, the disease remains unchanged. In  most patients, muscle stiffness is associated with transient weakness after rest. In MC, complaints are similar but more benign. Muscle stiffness caused by these diseases is a result of repetitive firing of muscle fiber action potentials (myotonic runs) (3). Two mechanisms have been proposed to cause the underlying intrinsic muscle hyperexcitability: (i) a decrease in muscle chloride conductance, as found in several human  SCIENCE * VOL. 257 * 7 AUGUST 1992  797  Downloaded from http://science.sciencemag.org/ on October 8, 2017  which demonstrates that ; was ubiquitinated. Unmodified ; (16 kD) was not recognized by the anti-ubiquitin reagents. The presence of additional activation-dependent species on ubiquitin blots (Fig. 3, A and B) suggested the possibility that other TCR components were ubiquitinated. Immunoprecipitated TCRs were resolved on lower percentage polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin (Fig. 4, A and B). Spots that varied in pI and migrated at 34 and 42 kD (Fig. 4B) were suggestive of ubiquitination of the 26-kD CD3 8 subunit, which exhibits heterogeneity in pI as a result of variable modifications with sialic acid. A duplicate immunoblot from activated cells was probed with a polyclonal antiserum to CD3 8 (18). In addition to the 26-kD 8, two sets of larger molecular size forms were seen (Fig. 4C) that comigrated with the species detected by anti-ubiquitin (Fig. 4B). These larger forms of 8 were detected only in activated cells (Fig. 5A). The presence of charge heterogeneity for ubiquitinated 8 indicated that these subunits contained sialic acid and therefore had traversed the intermediate Golgi apparatus. The finding of relatively acidic species, including a 27-kD form above 21-kD phosphorylated 4 (Fig. 1D) (10), indicated that ubiquitinated forms of phosphorylated C also exist. To confirm this, we incubated immunoprecipitates from activated and unactivated cells with alkaline phosphatase before electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5B). This resulted in the loss of phosphorylated 4 (21 kD) as well as the loss of the 27-kD species. Thus, it is apparent that this 27-kD form was ubiquitinated phosphorylated ;. We estimate that approximately 10% of TCR-associated 4 is ubiquitinated upon activation. On the basis of the distribution of heterodimers on diagonal gels, it would appear that ubiquitinated ; chains are more likely to be dimerized to other ubiquitinated ; molecules than to 16-kD ;. These proteins exist primarily as components of assembled receptors (Fig. 2) (10), and their appearance is not a result of redistribution from a detergent insoluble pool (10). Human T cells also demonstrate the same activation-induced forms of ubiquitinated ; (10). In 2B4 cells, both ubiquitinated 4 and phosphorylated 4 appear within 5 min of stimulation and persist for at least 2 hours (10). A dichotomy is apparent in freshly isolated normal splenocytes where ubiquitination of ; increases markedly with receptor engagement, whereas tyrosine phosphorylated ; is present at maximal levels without stimulation. This may be a result of the in vivo signals that regulate these processes. Alternatively, it may be a manifestation of differences in the half-lives of these modifications or of the receptors that are altered. The activationinduced ubiquitination of the TCR suggests the possibility of a more generalized function  1  ll IMA-WE M  1  0,W  o = 0.0) and to a lesser extent to TCRB (z = 2.53 at 0 = 0.0). Combined linkage analysis of GM to both loci resulted in a maximum multipoint lod score of z = 5.79 at 0 = 0.0 (Table 1). In addition, for two of the clinically typical GM families, a rare Nsi I pattern was detected with the CLC-1 probe. In pedigree 4003 (Fig. 2), the consanguineous parents show this unusual Nsi I pattern (A3). They both lack the = 17-kb fragment of allele A2, which is replaced by % 10- and =7-kb fragments as a result of the additional Nsi I site. The three affected sons are homozygous for this site. In one other  family, only the father was a carrier for A3 and transmitted it to all three affected offspring (19). Because this unusual Nsi I site was not observed in 110 control individuals, this suggests that it may be generated directly by the disease-causing mutation. We identified this mutation using restriction by Nsi I to search for it in genomic CLC- 1 clones isolated from libraries constructed from an unaffected individual and from a GM patient homozygous for this site (one of the affected brothers of  pedigree 4003) (Fig. 2) (20). Sequencing revealed a T-to-G exchange in exonic sequence (Fig. 3A), leading to the Nsi I site  Fig. 1. Localization of the human CLC-1 gene on chromoA B C D E F G H J some 7.

In support of the first, a genetic defect in the skeletal muscle Cl- channel CLC- 1 (7) was recently found in the recessive myotonic mouse mutant ADR (8). Because Cl- conductance accounts for about 80% of normal resting muscle membrane conductance (9), its decrease [or pharmacological blockage (3, 9)] leads to a slower rate of repolarization after action potentials and to myotonic runs. Alterations of Na' channel activity, especially late openings, were observed in a large proportion of biopsies from GM patients (4, 10) and especially in biopsies from MC patients (11). Related findings were made with other disorders with the symptom myotonia, such as myotonic dystrophy (10, 12) and Schwarz-Jampel syndrome (13). By homology screening with the major rat skeletal muscle chloride channel CLC-1 (7), we cloned a partial human CLC-1 cDNA that covers about 80% of the coding sequence (14). This region is 88% identical to the rat channel in amino acids (14). CLC-1 was then physically localized by somatic cell hybrids to the chromosomal region 7q32-qter (Fig. 1) and used to search for restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in ten unrelated individuals. Among 25 enzymes tested, diallelic Nsi I and Ava II RFLPs were revealed (15) and subsequently used in five reference pedigrees to prove linkage to the T cell receptor P3 (TCRB) locus (16) on chromosome 7q. Tight linkage with no recombinants was shown for CLC-1/Nsi I versus CLC-1/Ava II with a lod (logarithm of odds) score (17) of z = 3.62 at a recombination fraction of 0 = 0.0 and for TCRB versus the combined CLC-1 haplotype of z = 5.23 at 0 = 0.0 (Table 1). The fact that the CLC-1 locus was previously linked to the TCRB locus in mice (8) supports the mouse-human homology map for this chromosomal region on human chromosome 7q and mouse chromosome 6. Both human gene probes, CLC-1 and TCRB, were used to test the members of seven GM families (18). Linkage was shown to the CLC-1 haplotype (z = 4.69 at  7... .*....,;.ff7 ffff:.7w'..:ffaf.>~fft  Fig. 3. Identification of a mutation A present in GM.

Recent reports have stressed the effects of altered Na+ channel kinetics (1 1) in MC. These kinetic effects are likely to be secondary, especially because similar observations were made in myotonic dystrophy (10, 12), where the defective gene has been mapped to chromosome 19 (21) and whose gene product is probably a protein kinase (22). Thus, our data suggest that mutations in the muscle Cl- channel can cause myotonia with either a recessive or a dominant mode of inheritance. A recessive form is easily explained by a total loss of function. This has been described in ADR mice (8), which we now show to be an excellent model system for human myotonia. On the other hand, a mutation acting dominantly could possibly be explained by a homomultimeric structure of the channel [the multimeric state of channels of this family is currently unknown (7, 23, 24)]. In this model, the channel subunit encoded by the mutated gene associates with and inactivates the functional subunits encoded by the normal allele. Such a situation was found with transgenic Drosophila that expresses a mutant Shaker K' channel (25). This model may also fit with the observation that the clinical phenotype is often less severe in MC than in GM patients (1) and that electrophysiological evidence for re-  rwmW  A  C  2t  22  |  rLC 1 R L L Y P G I V T F V I A S L T F P P G M G Q F M A G E L M P R E A I S T hCLC-1 R L L Y P G I V T F V I A S F T F P P G M G Q F M A G E L M P R E A I S T  2  21  21  12  SCIENCE * VOL. 257 * 7 AUGUST 1992  duced Cl- conductance was weaker in MC (11); possibly, some of the channel complexes escape inactivation by the mutated subunit. Thus, our work also indirectly suggests a multimeric structure of CLC-1 Cl- channels. REFERENCES AND NOTES 1. P. E.

A single positive clone was identified and subcloned by in vivo excision. Sequencing revealed that it begins at bp 510 relative to the rat channel and extends into the 3' noncoding region (total length = 2517 bp) (K. Steinmeyer, C. Lorenz, T. J. Jentsch, in preparation). The sequence has been deposited in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory/GenBank database (accession number M97820).

This Phe, located toward the end of putative membrane span D8, is highly conserved among different members of the voltage-gated Cl- channel family and thus is probably important for channel function (Fig. 3B). The propensity of the new Cys to form improper disulfide bonds may be involved in the pathogenic effect of this mutation. Thus, there is strong evidence that GM is caused by defects in the skeletal muscle Cl- channel CLC-1. Definitive proof that the Phe-to-Cys mutation really causes the disease will have to await the functional expression of the mutated channel. Because this mutation is present in only a proportion of affected GM individuals, there is probably heterogeneity in CLC-1 mutations that cause GM. Having shown close linkage of CLC- 1 to the disorder GM and having identified a GM-associated mutation, we tested the members of four MC families (18) for the same linkage hypothesis (Fig. 4). The MC data resulted in a maximum multipoint lod score of z = 4.58 at 0 = 0.0 (12 scorable meioses) (Table 1), which suggests that CLC-1 is also involved in this dominant disease. Definitive proof will require the identification of CLC-1 mutations in MC.  j**ji*  WIM,  cDNA fragments that still recognized the unusual Nsi site detected by genomic Southern (DNA) analysis, and the region surrounding the restriction site was sequenced with the chain termination method.

Choi and Donald L. Nuss* Strains of the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica that contain viral doublestranded RNAs often exhibit reduced virulence. Such hypovirulent strains act as biocontrol agents by virtue of their ability to convert virulent strains to hypovirulence after anastomosis. Transformation of virulent C. parasitica strains with a full-length complementary DNA copy of a hypovirulence-associated viral RNA conferred the complete hypovirulence phenotype. Cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA was resurrected from the chromosomally integrated complementary DNA copy and was able to convert compatible virulent strains to hypovirulence. These results establish viral double-stranded RNA as the causal agent of hypovirulence and demonstrate the feasibility of engineering hypovirulent fungal strains.  The North American chestnut blight epidemic, initiated by the unintentional introduction of the Asian fungus Cryphonectria (Endothia) parasitica at the turn of the century, resulted in the destruction of several billion mature American chestnut trees (14). The potential for biological control of chestnut blight effected by naturally occurring strains of C. parasitica that exhibit reduced levels of virulence (hypovirulence) has been demonstrated (5-7). Whereas virulent C. parasitica strains penetrate and destroy bark and cambium layers and cause wilting and death, hypovirulent strains usually produce superficial cankers that eventually heal. Hypovirulence is correlated with the presence of cytoplasmically repliDepartment of Molecular Oncology and Virology, Roche Institute of Molecular Biology, Roche Research Center, Nutley, NJ 07110. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  800  cating  unencapsidated  double-stranded  RNAs (dsRNAs) (8). The ability of these genetic elements and the hypovirulence phenotype to be transmitted to virulent Fig. 1. Genetic organization of the hypovirulence-associated virus RNA, L-dsRNA, present in hypovirulent C. parasitica strain EP71 3 [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) number 52571] and construction of the full-  fungal strains after anastomosis (physical fusion of hyphae) provides the basis for disease control (7). The largest dsRNA present in hypovirulent C. parasitica strain EP713, large dsRNA (L-dsRNA), was recently cloned and characterized (9-12). The similarity of the L-dsRNA genetic organization and expression strategy to those of several viral genomes (1 1) and an apparent evolutionary relationship to the plant potyviruses (13) prompted the introduction of the term hypovirulence-associated virus (HAV) to denote this class of genetic elements (11). Efforts to rigorously demonstrate HAV dsRNAs as the causal agent of hypovirulence have been hampered by the inability of these viral elements to initiate infection by an extracellular route, a common property of mycoviruses and fungus-associated unencapsidated viral-like RNAs (14-16). We describe the construction of a fulllength cDNA clone of EP713 L-dsRNA that, when introduced into virulent C. parasitica strains by DNA-mediated transformation, generated a resurrected, cytoplasmically replicating dsRNA form from the integrated cDNA copy. One strand of L-dsRNA contains a 3' polyadenylate [poly(A)1 tail that is basepaired to a stretch of polyuridine [poly(U)J present at the 5' terminus of the complementary strand (17). The molecule consists of 12,712 bp, excluding the poly(A): poly(U) homopolymer domain and contains two large open reading frames (ORF) within the poly(A) strand that were designated ORF A (622 codons) and ORF B (3,165 codons) (11). To construct a fulllength cDNA clone of L-dsRNA, we first generated several large intermediate clones from a set of overlapping partial cDNA clones (Fig. 1). A four-factor ligation-transformation was then performed to generate plasmid pLDST that contained a full-length cDNA copy of L-dsRNA inserted between the Xba I and Hind III sites of pUC19.

The prevalence of these two diseases was assumed (1) to be 1:50,000 in GM and 1:23,000 in MC. 18. After receipt of informed consent, seven families (a total of 14 affected and 13 nonaffected siblings) with the diagnosis of GM and 4 families with MC (20 affected, 7 nonaffected, and 7 spouses) were studied. The age of onset for individuals with GM was 2 to 10 years, and 1 to 18 years for MC. All individuals in a family received a thorough neurological examination. In addition, a standardized forearm cooling test was performed on MC individuals to exclude paramyotonia congenita [K. Ricker et al., Arch. Neurol. 47, 268 (1990)].

Identification and Expression of a Common Missense Mutation (L302P) in the Acid Sphingomyelinase Gene of Ashkenazi Jewish Type A Niemann-Pick Disease Patients By Orna Levran, Robert J. Desnick, and Edward H.Schuchman Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) result from the deficient activity of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM; E.C. 3.1.4.12) and the resultant lysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin. Type A disease is a fatal, neurodegenerative disorder of infancy, whereas type B disease has no neurologic manifestations and is characterized primarily by reticuloendothelial involvement and survival into adulthood. Both disorders occur more frequently among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry than in the general population. Recently, a missense mutation in the ASM gene (designated R496L) was detected in more than 30% of the ASM alleles from Ashkenazi Jewish type A NPD patients. We report a second, common mutation that resulted from a T t o C transition at nucleotide 905 and predicted a leucine t o proline substitution at ASM codon 302 (designated L302P). Notably, the L302P mutation occurred in 23.5% (8 of 34) of the  Ashkenazi Jewish type A NPD alleles studied. In contrast, it was not found in any of the ASM alleles from non-Jewish type A patients, in 36 alleles from type B patients, or in 100 ASM alleles from normal Ashkenazi Jewish individuals. To confirm the authenticities of the L302P and R496L mutations, each nucleotide change was separately introduced into the full-length ASM cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis and transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. Neither mutation expressed ASM catalytic activity, consistent with the type A phenotype of homoallelic patients. The identification of the L302P mutation should further facilitate molecular carrier detection for NPD in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, particularly because the L302P mutation can be easily detected using the restriction enzyme, AlwNI. o 1992by The American Society of Hematology.  N  of 629 amino acid residues. The availability of this cDNA permitted the localization of the ASM gene to the narrow chromosomal region 11~15.1to 15.4 by the use of somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization techniques.17 Studies also have been initiated to determine the nature of the genetic lesions causing types A and B NPD.1sJ9By sequencing polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified ASM cDNAs from a type A patient of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, a single G to T transversion was identified that predicted an arginine to leucine substitution in residue 496 of the ASM polypeptide (designated R496L).lS The R496L mutation was found in about one third (ie, 32%) of the Ashkenazi Jewish type A NPD alleles studied. In contrast, only about 5% of the alleles from non-Jewish type A patients had this mutation. Some type A patients were homoallelic for the R496L mutation, whereas others were heteroallelic, indicating the occurrence of other ASM mutations that caused the type A phenotype. Interestingly, the R496L mutation also was detected in one of the two Ashkenazi Jewish type B patients studied. The other ASM allele in this mildly affected patient had a 3-base deletion that resulted in the  IEMANN-PICK DISEASE (NPD) is an inborn error of sphingomyelin catabolism that results from the deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, acid sphingomyelinase (ASM; sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase; E.C. 3.1.4.12).1,2 Two allelic forms of this autosomal recessive disorder have been delineated based on their distinct phenotypes.2-6Type A NPD is a severe, neurodegenerative disorder of infancy characterized by progressive psychomoter retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, and death by 3 years of age. In contrast, type B NPD is a nonneuronopathic disorder characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, respiratory involvement, and survival into adulthood. The clinical course of patients with type B NPD is quite variable, and some mildly affected patients may survive into the sixth decade of life? Both types occur more frequently among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent ( 1/40,000) than in the general p ~ p u l a t i o n However, .~ mass screening for carrier detection in this population has been precluded because of the marked overlap of ASM enzymatic activities in leukocytes and cultured cells from obligate heterozygotes and normal individuals. To date, biochemical investigations into the genetic heterogeneity underlying the neuronopathic type A and nonneuronopathic type B phenotypes have been limited. In general, type A NPD patients tend to have slightly lower residual activities in crude cell and tissue homogenates than type B patients using various substrates and analogues for assay.8-10However, the residual activities have not been well characterized, nor have the physicokinetic properties from type A and B patients been c ~ m p a r e d . ~ ?

This T to C transition, which predicted a leucine to proline substitution at residue 302 of the ASM polypeptide (designated L302P), was not identified in any of the non-Jewish type A NPD alleles studied. In addition, it was not identified in any of the 36 alleles studied from Jewish or non-Jewish type B patients. Transient expression studies showed that neither the L302P nor the R496L mutation expressed catalytically active ASM, consistent with the fact that homoallelism for either of these mutations results in the neuronopathic type A NPD phenotype. MATERIALS AND METHODS  Cell lines. Primary cultures of fibroblasts and lymphoblasts were established from skin biopsies and peripheral blood samples obtained with informed consent from NPD patients and family members, and from normal individuals. NPD lines GM00165, GM00370, GM00406, GM00559, GM02895, and GM03252 were obtained from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ).

The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, and 1 mg/mL streptomycin by standard  procedures. The diagnosis of type A or B NPD was based on clinical criteria (eg. age at onset, presence of neurologic involvement) and by the demonstration of markedly deficient ASM activity in cultured cells? Identification of the L302P mutation. To identify the ASM mutation(s) in an Ashkenazi Jewish type A NPD patient, proband 4, PCR amplification20was performed on genomic DNA isolated from cultured skin fibroblasts.21The complete ASM coding region, including the introdexon boundaries, was amplified in four fragments using the PCR primer pairs shown in Table 1 (primers P1 to P8). PCR amplifications were performed for 30 cycles with Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). Each amplification cycle consisted of denaturation for 1minute at 9 4 T , annealing for 1to 2 minutes at temperatures varying from 60°C to 72”C, and extension for 1to 2 minutes at 72°C. For PCR product 1,which included exon 1and 632 bp of exon 2, a PCR “boost” procedure was required and a slightly modified PCR buffer was used.17 After PCR amplification, the PCR products were precipitated by isopropanol in the presence of ammonium acetate (final concentration, 2.5 mol/L), and subcloned into the PCR-1000 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). For each ligation, from four to six independant subclones were sequenced by the dideoxy nucleotide chain termination method.” Confirmation of the L302P mutation by dot blot hybridization and restriction enzyme analyses. For detection of the L302P mutation in other NPD patients, their family members, and normal individuals, dot blot hybridization analyses2l were performed on a 570-bp genomic fragment amplified from cell lysates using PCR primers P3 and P4 (Table 1). PCR amplification was performed for 30 cycles, each consisting of denaturation for 1 minute at 9 4 T , annealing for 1.5 minutes at 62T, and extension for 1.5 minutes at 72°C. Dot blot hybridization was performed using Zetabind nylon membranes (AMF-Cuno, Richmond, CA) and a BioRad dot-blot apparatus (Richmond, CA). Hybridizations were performed by standard techniques using the normal and mutant allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASOs), (5 ’-GTCACAGCAC’ITGTGAG-3’)and (5’-GTCACAGCACmGTGAG-3’), respectively, with the mutated nucleotide underlined.

The L302P mutation also could be detected by restriction enzyme analysis because the T to C transition introduced anAZwNI site into the ASM gene. The 570-bp ASM genomic fragment was amplified using PCR primers P3 and P4. After amplification, the fragment was digested with AIwNI and electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel.

After PCR amplification, the fragments were purified from agarose gels and combined for use as the template in a second PCR amplification using sense and antisense PCR primers P9 and P12, respectively. Note that primers P9 and PI2 overlapped unique S ’ I and Bcl I sites in the pASM-3 cDNA, respectively. PCR amplifications were performed for 20 to 25 cycles, each consisting of denaturation for 1 minute at 94T, annealing for 1 to 2 minutes at temperatures varying from 45°C to 65T, and extension for 1 to 2 minutes at 72°C. After amplification, the 734-bp PCR product was subcloned into the PCR-1000 vector and sequenced to confirm the presence of the L302P mutation and to determine that no other mutations had been introduced into the ASM cDNA fragment. To construct the full-length ASM cDNA containing the L302P mutation, the mutated SfiI-BcZ I fragment was isolated from the PCR-1000 subclone and inserted into the pASM-3 cDNA by ligation exchange.

Because previous dot blot hybridization studies had shown that proband 4 did not have an R496L allele,IR this Ashkenazi Jewish type A patient was selected as a candidate for identifying new type A NPD mutations. The ASM coding sequence was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA obtained from proband 4, and the four fragments containing the entire ASM coding region, including the intron/ exon boundaries, were subcloned and sequenced. Figure 2A shows the DNA sequence obtained from a region of exon 2; note that proband 4 had a T to C transition at nucleotide 905 in each of the six sequenced subclones. This single-base change predicted a leucine to proline substitution in codon 302 of the ASM polypeptide (designated U20P). To confirm the authenticity of the W02P missense mutation, dot blot hybridization analysis was performed on genomic DNA obtained from proband 4 and his family members (Fig 2B). These studies showed that proband 4 was homoallelic for the W02P mutation and that both of his parents, a phenotypically normal sister and brother, as well as the maternal grandfather were heterozygous. The W02P mutation, which introduced a unique AfwNI restriction site into the ASM gene, was not identified in more than 100 ASM alleles from normal Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, indicating that this nucleotide change was not a polymorphism in this population. Further confirmation of the authenticityof the W02P mutation was obtained by sequencing the PCR-amplified ASM coding region from an unrelated, Ashkenazi Jewish type A NPD patient, proband 5 (not shown). This patient also was homoallelic for the W02P mutation. Occurrence of the L302P mutation in types A and B NPD.

Whether one additional major mutation or a series of less frequent mutations will account for the remainder of the lesions causing this disorder must await further analyses. However, evidence from three other disorders that occur in the Ashkenazi Jewish population with a frequency of 1 in 2,500 or greater suggest that one or more common (15% to 50%) alleles is likely. For example, two common mutations, a 4-bp insertion30 and a splice-site mutation?l account for more than 95% of the mutant p-hexosaminidase a-chain alleles in Ashkenazi Jewish patients with infantile Tay-Sachs disease. Ashkenazi Jewish patients who have the milder, adult-onset form of the disease have one of these alleles and the S269G missense mutation in the other a-chain allele.32 In type 1 Gaucher’s disease, three mutations in the acid p-glucosidase gene, N370S,33 L444P,34 and 84GG,35 account for about 90% of the Ashkenazi Jewish patients. Similarly, in cystic fibrosis, three mutations, AF508,36 W1282X,37 and G542X38 in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulatory gene are responsible for about 95% of the disease alleles in DISCUSSION Ashkenazi Jewish individuals. Previously, a missense mutation, R496L, was reported as Based on these findings, it might be expected that the first lesion in the ASM gene causing type A NPD.ls This perhaps one or two remaining common mutations causing mutation occurred in more than 30% of the mutant ASM type A NPD will be identified in the Ashkenazi Jewish alleles from Ashkenazi Jewish type A NPD patients.

Type A disease is a fatal, neurodegenerative disorder of infancy, whereas type B disease has no neurologic manifestations and is characterized primarily by reticuloendothelial involvement and survival into adulthood. Both disorders occur more frequently among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry than in the general population. Recently, a missense mutation in the ASM gene (designated R496L) was detected in more than 30% of the ASM alleles from Ashkenazi Jewish type A NPD patients. We report a second, common mutation that resulted from a T to C transition at nucleotide 905 and predicted a leucine to proline substitution at ASM codon 302 (designated L302P). Notably, the L302P mutation occurred in 23.5% (8 of 34) of the Ashkenazi Jewish type A NPD alleles studied. In contrast, it was not found in any of the ASM alleles from non-Jewish type A patients, in 36 alleles from type B patients, or in 100 ASM alleles from normal Ashkenazi Jewish individuals. To confirm the authenticities of the L302P and R496L mutations, each nucleotide change was separately introduced into the full-length ASM cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis and transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. Neither mutation expressed ASM catalytic activity, consistent with the type A phenotype of homoallelic patients. The identification of the L302P mutation should further facilitate molecular carrier detection for NPD in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, particularly because the L302P mutation can be easily detected using the restriction enzyme, AlwNl."
"1","Sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to de novo myosin mutations.Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy occurs as an autosomal dominant familial disorder or as a sporadic disease without familial involvement.

While missense mutations in the ft cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene account for approximately half of all cases of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the molecular causes of sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are unknown. To determine whether ft cardiac MHC mutations are also associated with sporadic disease, we screened this gene in seven individuals with sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Mutations in the ft cardiac MHC genes were identified in two probands with sporadic disease. In that their parents were neither clinically nor genetically affected, we conclude that mutations in each proband arose de novo. Transmission of the mutation and disease to an offspring occurred in one pedigree, predicting that these are germline mutations. The demonstration of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy arising within a pedigree coincident with the appearance of a de novo mutation provides compelling genetic evidence that ft cardiac MHC mutations cause this disease. We suggest that de novo mutations account for some instances of sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and that these mutations can be transmitted to children. The clinical benefits of defining mutations responsible for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should also be available to some patients with sporadic disease. (J. Clin. Invest. 1992. 90:16661671.) Key words: cardiac hypertrophy * myosin heavy chain gene - RNase protection  Introduction Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is defined as a primary myocardial disorder (1, 2), characterized by increased ventricular mass with myocyte and myofibrillar disarray (3, 4), that occurs in the absence of other cardiac or systemic disorders. The diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is based upon the demonstration of unexplained ventricular hypertrophy. Hypertrophy is typically asymmetric, involving the septum and left ventricular free wall (5-7), but may be concentric or confined to the distal left ventricle and/or right ventricle (8-10). The familial form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is inherited as Address reprint requests to Dr. Seidman, Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, 25 Shattuck Street, Boston, MA 02115. Received for publication 24 March 1992 and in revised form 10 June 1992.  an autosomal dominant trait (5, 11-14). Thus, individuals with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy frequently have multiple affected relatives, and must have one affected parent. Sporadic occurrence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is defined by similar anatomical and clinical features in an individual whose parents do not have the condition (6, 15). Estimation of the fraction of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that occurs as sporadic disease has been difficult. Two studies using two-dimensional echocardiography in families of probands with at least three available first degree relatives suggested that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was sporadic in 44% ( 16) and 33% (17). However, clinical studies tend to overestimate the proportion of sporadic disease for several reasons. First, the severity and distribution of hypertrophy vary considerably, even between related family members, hence assignment of disease status may be inaccurate. Second, there are difficulties of ascertainment in retrospective studies where family members, especially parents, may be deceased or unavailable for study. Third, many of the families studied are too small for familial disease to manifest. For these reasons affected relatives may not be identified, with the result that the disease is assumed to be sporadic. We have previously identified j3 cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC)' mutations that cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in about 50% of unrelated families with this disorder ( 18-21 ). Seven different mutations have been identified; all are missense mutations affecting conserved residues in the amino-terminal half of the myosin heavy chain. Knowledge of the particular 3 cardiac MHC gene mutation in a family with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is of clinical importance, in terms of both diagnosis (20) and prognosis (21 ). To investigate the molecular basis of sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy we screened the ,3 cardiac MHC genes of seven unrelated probands with sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis was based on the presence of typical clinical features of the disease in the proband and the absence of disease criteria in both parents. We demonstrate that two of these probands have /3 cardiac MHC mutations that are comparable to those found in patients with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Genetic analyses of the probands' parents reveal that both mutations have arisen de novo, coincident with the appearance of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  Methods Clinical evaluation.

Abbreviations used in this paper: MHC, myosin heavy chain; STR, short tandem repeat (sequence).  Protection of Human Subjects from Research Risks, blood was drawn from probands and their first-degree relatives. Clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic assessments were performed as described previously (22). The diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was based on the demonstration of unexplained left, right or biventricular hypertrophy. An individual was diagnosed with sporadic disease if both parents were available for study and lacked criteria for diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Detection ofmutations. The techniques used to screen the ft cardiac MHC gene coding sequence for mutations have been described in detail elsewhere (20, 21 ). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify # cardiac MHC gene or mRNA sequences from affected individuals' Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphocytes. Both normal and mutationally altered ft cardiac MHC mRNA was detected by two rounds of PCR amplification. Amplified sequences were hybridized to RNA probes transcribed from a normal gene and RNase A protection assays performed as described previously (20, 21 ). The entire # cardiac MHC coding sequence was examined in all probands, using both sense and antisense riboprobes. Amplified DNAs that yielded abnormal RNase cleavage patterns were reanalyzed with new DNA isolates to exclude artifacts arising from PCR, and then subjected to dideoxy nucleotide sequence analysis. Where possible, the nucleotide change identified by sequencing was independently confirmed by demonstration of a predicted change in restriction enzyme site. Amino acid sequences were deduced from DNA sequences. Genetic analysis offamilies. When a mutation was identified in a proband with sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy its presence was sought in first-degree relatives by either RNase protection assays or restriction enzyme digestion. Paternity was confirmed by demonstration of inheritance of appropriate alleles at eight polymorphic dimeric short tandem repeat sequences (STRs): APOAII, APOCII, ASS, DIS103, DlSl 16, GCG, INT2, and PLA2 (23-29), using PCR conditions as described previously with end-labeled forward primers (23). Allele frequencies were calculated from a panel of 22 unrelated probands. The parental origin and subsequent inheritance of chromosomes bearing the de novo mutations in the probands was assessed by analysis ofinheritance of alleles at polymorphisms within the # cardiac MHC gene: dimeric STRs in the 5' untranslated region (30) and in intron 24 ( 31 ) and the restriction fragment length polymorphism identified by probe pSC14 (32).  Results Seven unrelated probands with sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were identified; all had typical features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with maximum left ventricular wall thickness ranging from 1.8 to 4.0 cm (median 3.0 cm). The ,3 cardiac MHC gene was analyzed in each proband, using the RNase protection assay. ,3 cardiac MHC gene mutations were found in two of these probands, designated H and AR. Clinical analyses Family H. Individual 11-2 in family H was diagnosed with hy-  pertrophic cardiomyopathy because of typical clinical features (Table I and Fig. 1 ). The proband's father (I-1 ) has a 10-year history of treatment for essential hypertension and symptomatic ischemic heart disease and underwent open heart surgery in 1974 for excision of a left atrial myxoma. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed atrial flutter with minor repolarization changes; a two-dimensional echocardiogram demonstrated a dilated left atrium (6 cm) and a mildly dilated poorly contracting left ventricle without hypertrophy. Based on the absence of typical features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and the presence of known cardiovascular disease, individual I- 1 was diagnosed as unaffected by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Clinical  analyses of the proband's mother (1-2) were entirely normal. Individuals 1-1 and 1-2 had not been studied previously. Previous analyses of the proband's children had identified one affected individual, III-2 (21 ). All other members of the family have an entirely normal clinical examination, EKG and echocardiogram. Family AR. Individual 11-1 in family AR also has typical clinical features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with marked asymmetric septal hypertrophy and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (Table I). The proband's father, individual I- 1, had a past medical history of myocardial infarction in 1979. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed anteroseptal Q waves; there were no features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy on two-dimensional echocardiogram. Clinical studies of all other first  Table I.

This G to A transition in exon 23 (designated Glu924Lys) encodes a lysine residue rather than a glutamic acid residue at position  924 (numbered according to reference 30). The nucleotide substitution, as detected by an RNase protection assay of DNA amplified from exon 23 (Fig. 2), is present in both the proband (II-2) and her daughter (III-2), but neither parent. This result was confirmed by repeat analysis of independent samples from each family member. This mutation does not result in any change in restriction enzyme site. 1668  Watkins ei al.  Two possible explanations exist for the finding that neither parent bears the mutation present in the proband. Either the mutation has arisen de novo, or else has been inherited from a father other than individual I- 1. To determine if individual I- 1 was the biological father of individuals 11-1 and II-2 we have characterized the alleles found in father (I-I), mother (1-2), son (II-1), and daughter (II-2) at eight polymorphic STRs spread throughout the genome (Methods). At each locus the children have inherited alleles present in the father's genome, rather than other alleles that exist in the general population (Fig. 3 and data not shown). From the frequency of the inherited alleles in the population we have calculated that the odds that a particular individual, chosen at random from the population, would have been able to produce the alleles found in individuals II-I or II-2 are < 1 in 100,000. We conclude that  243  152  abnormality on RNase protection. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed this to be due to a C to T transition in exon 20 (affecting nucleotide residue 2253, numbered according to reference 33). This substitution encodes a change from the normal arginine amino acid residue to a cysteine in the mutant polypeptide, and is designated Arg723Cys. Arginine residue 723 is conserved among all known cardiac MHC's and all vertebrate striated muscle MHC's except the human perinatal and rabbit skeletal isoforms (34); mutation to a cysteine residue constitutes a nonconservative substitution with a change in net charge. This missense mutation, which is highly analogous to those others previously described, has not been seen in analyses of more than 180 normal chromosomes. The nucleotide substitution involved in the Arg723Cys mutation is predicted to abolish a BcgI restriction enzyme site present in the normal cDNA sequence. Digestion of amplified cDNA sequences with this enzyme (Fig. 4) confirms the presence of the mutation in individual II- 1 and also confirms that all other members of the family are genetically unaffected. The paternal relationship of individual 1-1 to 11-1 was confirmed with the eight polymorphic markers, providing odds of greater than 100,000 to 1 in favor of paternity. The , cardiac MHC gene polymorphisms were not sufficiently informative in family AR to determine the parental origin of the chromosome that acquired the Arg723Cys mutation.  bp  bp  91 bp -*o  IW  Discussion  '0  Figure 2.

Squares denote males and circles denote females; solid symbols denote those clinically affected and open symbols denote those unaffected. Below is an RNase protection assay of exon 23 DNA from each individual, in corresponding positions to those of the pedigree. Amplified DNA is hybridized to a 32P-labeled RNA probe of normal ,B MHC sequence which is then digested with RNase A, resulting in cleavage at mismatched bases. The normal exon protects a 243 base fragment (arrow); the Glu924Lys mutation results in cleavage of this to fragments of 91 and 152 bases (arrows). Cleavage due to the nucleotide mismatch is present only in the clinically affected individuals 11-2 and III-2.  individual I-1 is the biological father of both the proband and her unaffected brother. The parental origin of the chromosome bearing the de novo mutation was assessed by haplotype analysis of the 13 cardiac MHC gene. Polymorphisms in a dimeric STR present in the 5' untranslated region (methods) demonstrate that the chromosome bearing the Glu924Lys mutation in the proband (II-2) was inherited from the father (I- I). This chromosome, which bears a normal copy of the 13 cardiac MHC gene in the father, is also inherited in its normal state by an unaffected son (II-1 ) (data not shown). Thus this normal chromosome is associated with absence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in individuals I- 1 and II- 1, but once carrying the new Glu924Lys mutation is associated with the appearance of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in individuals II-2 and 111-2. Family AR. Screening the 13 cardiac MHC gene cDNA sequence in the proband of family AR (11-1) identified a novel  These analyses identify two examples of missense mutations in the : cardiac MHC genes of individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy whose parents are clinically and genetically unaffected. We speculate that the 1 cardiac MHC gene mutations in both probands arose in a germline cell as these mutations are expressed in cells ofdifferent lineages, including myocytes and peripheral leukocytes, as well as ovarian germ cells in the proband of family H. Collectively, these data suggest that sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can result from new mutations that may then be inherited. In one family studied (AR), the affected proband is typical of cases of sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and no first-degree relatives are clinically or genetically affected. However because there is only a 50% chance that a given chromosome will be inherited by each child, the probability of a new mutation appearing in the subsequent generation is determined by the number of offspring. Documentation of germline mutations is frequently difficult in families of small size. Analyses of the H family demonstrated a de novo 13 cardiac MHC gene mutation that is inherited; analyses of generations I and II identify sporadic disease while studies of generations II and III demonstrate a familial pattern. We conclude that de novo 13 cardiac MHC gene mutations can cause sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; in at least some instances, these new mutations contribute to the incidence of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The demonstration of de novo germline mutations in the 13 cardiac MHC gene in individuals with sporadic disease is important in confirming that these mutations are directly responsible for producing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In families that coinherit hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and abnormalities ofthe MHC gene, the possibility exists that these abnormalities are merely linked to an unknown gene that is itself responsible for the phenotype. The evidence against this, although very  Sporadic Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Due to De Novo Myosin Mutations  1669  I- I- IIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP1 2 1  I 2  .1  2  -3 ---  4 6  6  7/  7 7 8  8/  Figure 3.

The evidence in families H and AR of a normal gene in unaffected individuals acquiring a de novo mutation in individuals who develop sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cannot be explained by such a chance association.

A 500 base-  pair ,B cardiac MHC cDNA is amplified as previously described, using primers numbered 1925 and 2424 (21 ). Digestion of a product of normal sequence generates fragments of 320 and 150 bp (arrows). The sample from individual II- 1 contains these fragments but also the 500 base-pair fragment (arrow), because the Arg723Cys mutation abolishes the BcgI site on the affected chromosome. This mutation is not present in any other family member.  1670  Watkins et al.  Because of the difficulties in clinically defining sporadic  cases we are not able to determine the precise proportion of all  sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that is caused by de novo mutations in the j3 cardiac MHC gene. The finding of the two de novo mutations among the seven probands studied provides an estimate of the frequency of myosin mutations as a cause sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It appears that mutations in other genes can cause sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with an identical phenotype. It seems likely that other loci, as yet unknown, that cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will be candidates for de novo mutations that cause sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Alternatively, sporadic cases may occur through etiologically distinct mechanisms. Somatic mutations in the fi cardiac MHC gene occurring during embryogenesis that affect the heart progenitor cells but not the germline might be a cause of sporadic disease. Given that such somatic mutations would be unlikely to be expressed in peripheral leukocytes, these would not be detected by the techniques used in this study. Undefined environmental factors might similarly cause a hypertrophic phenotype and contribute to the incidence of sporadic disease. The finding of de novo mutations in the j3 cardiac MHC gene in individuals with sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has clinical implications. A genetic diagnosis based on demonstration of a myosin heavy chain mutation should assist in difficult diagnoses. The problems of establishing the clinical diagnosis in individual H 1-1 highlight this issue. Co-existing heart disease, especially hypertension, commonly confounds interpretation of clinical studies, and may prevent the diagnosis, or exclusion, of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The findings presented here suggest that the benefits of molecular genetic analysis of the ,3 cardiac MHC gene can be extended to a proportion of cases of sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We have previously shown that particular mutations specifically influence survival in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with nonconservative amino acid substitutions being associated with a worse prognosis (21 ). In the absence of a family history to predict prognosis, the value of defining the diseasecausing mutation as a prognostic indicator will be especially  great in sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Moreover, if an individual was not clinically recognized as having sporadic disease the impression of a benign family history may have led to an inappropriate assumption of low risk status. Genetic counseling for individuals with sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has not been previously feasible in the absence of an understanding of the etiology of the condition. On the assumption that sporadic disease was a separate, and perhaps nongenetic entity, the risk oftransmission to offspring may have been considered low. Whereas individuals with sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by de novo germline mutations in the f# cardiac MHC gene will transmit the disease gene to 50% of offspring. Once a f# cardiac MHC mutation has been identified in a proband, with either sporadic or familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the possibility exists of prenatal diagnosis or preclinical diagnosis in children. We conclude that sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is within the spectrum of familial disease. De novo f3 cardiac MHC gene mutations in germline cells contribute to the incidence of both the sporadic and familial variants of this disorder. Genetic analyses of sporadic cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can help to confirm diagnoses and provide important genetic information to physicians and affected individuals.

A family study showed that other members were affected. AT-III deficiency in this family was found to be due to a new variant ATIII TRURO 1. Young patients with strokes should be screened for thrombophilia. (7 Clin Pathol 1992;45:921-922)  The incidence of cerebrovascular events in young persons (25-40) is uncommon (2 per 10 000 per year)' and may be associated with inherited thrombophilia of which the common causes are protein C, protein S, and AT-III  deficiencies. Replacement therapy and long anticoagulation may prevent venous thromboembolism in affected persons. term  Department of Haematology, Royal Cornwall Hospital (Treliske), Truro, Cornwall J A Graham H M Daly P J Carson Correspondence  to:  Dr J A Graham, 70 St Ambrose Road, Heath, Cardiff CF4 4BH Accepted for publication 28 February 1992  Case report A 37 year old man (fig 1 (I-IIb)) was admitted with sudden onset of diplopia, dysarthria, and headache followed by collapse. Examination showed slight ataxia and rotatory nystagmus. He was taking warfarin (INR 2 2) because an underlying thrombotic defect had been suspected.  Eighteen months earlier a fractured tibia was complicated by deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. Up to 80 000 units of intravenous heparin were required to achieve satisfactory prolongation of his aplastic prothrombin time (APTT) (> 2-0) and before achieving this he developed repeated pulmonary emboli, necessitating admission to the intensive care unit. After admission he became critically ill and developed right cerebellar signs. A computed tomogram of the head (with contrast) (fig 2) showed a low density area in the right cerebellar hemisphere, effacement of the fourth ventricle, and a characteristic "delta" sign (see arrow). These appearances are highly suggestive of cerebellar venous thrombosis. The patient was too ill for angiographic confirmation. There was a strong family history of venous thrombosis (table). Investigation of the patient for an underlying thrombotic defect showed an AT-III antigen concentration of 66% (normal range 80-140%) and showed an activity level of 68% (normal range 80-130%). Warfarin was discontinued, because of the risk of haemorrhage secondary to the infarct, and heparin withheld because of the risk of a further reduction in AT-III activity. He was treated with AT-III concentrate daily to prevent further venous thrombosis. AT-III concentrations were measured daily and AT-III concentrate was administered to achieve a 20 minute postinfusion level of 100%. The dose was calculated as follows:  Family study  Dose in Ukg = desired increase x weight 1.6%  (a) I  9  Pr  9  I  (b)  (c)  (e)  -14  (d)  (g)  Key: * * Reduced concentrations of antithrombin III and venous thromboembolism Normal concentrations of antithrombin IIl and no venous thromboembolism O 0 0 Normal concentrations of antihrombolin III and venous thromboembolism E - Reduced concentrations of antithrombin Ill and no venous thromboembolism  (He received 820 units on day 1, 820 units 12 hourly on day 2, and 820 units on day 3). He remained seriously ill and for several days his survival was in doubt. However, within one week he began to improve and was given long term warfarin, aiming at an INR of 3 0-4 5. He was discharged four weeks later and had improved so much that his main concerns were about future employment and ability to drive. He remains fully active at the time of writing.  -  -  -  Figure I Family  tree.

Inheritance is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance. This family exhibits AT-Ill deficiency with low concentrations of both antigen and bioactivity. Unlike haemophilia when only concentrations of less than 5% are associated with severe bleeding, AT-Ill concentrations of less than 80% may be associated with venous thromboembolism, as in this family. Precipitating factors include pregnancy, surgery., or trauma. By the age of 50., 70% of those affected will have had at least one thrombotic event' which may be fatal. T'he propositus was initially difficult to anticoagulate with heparin., a feature of AT-Ill deficiency., and a clue to the underlying defect. We report this case to highlight the need to investigate young patients with cerebrovascular events. AT-Ill is one of the potentially preventable and treatable causes of thromboembolic disease and should be excluded. The propositus was already anticoagulated with warfarin (INR-2.2) when he developed a cerebellar venous infarct, but this proved inadequate. Such patients should be maintained at a higher level with an INR between 3-4.5. Lifelong treatment with anticoagulants in symptom free AT-Ill deficient patients is unlikely to improve survival but once they have developed overt thrombosis long term warfarin is advised.' AT-Ill concentrate is available for treatment of patients with an acute thrombotic event, or prophylactically, when at maximum risk-for example., at the time of delivery or surgery; it reduces the risk of mortality and  morbidity.

A candidate gene for human sex determination (SRY) was isolated in this region. Here, we describe a study of 25 cases of XY females with pure gonadal dysgenesis for mutations on the Y chromosome short arm, including SRY. Southern blotting revealed a sex-reversed female harboring a deletion extending from -8 kb from the pseudoautosomal boundary of the Y chromosome to at least 33 kb and no more than 60 kb upstream, toward the centromere. The deletion begins no more than 1.8 kb upstream from the first ATG of the SRY open reading frame present in the clone pY53.3. To our knowledge, no mutation has been described previously outside the SRY "HMG box" on the short arm of the Y chromosome, which is assoiated with sex reversal. Since the 5' extent of the SRY tnswriptional unit has not been defined, the deletion may remove up m exons of SRY and/or transcriptional regulatory motifs, either situation resulting in lack of ticular development. It cannot be formally excluded that the mutation removes a second locus, independent of SRY, that is critical for sex deternmnation. Denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the SRY open reading frame in the remaining 24 cases revealed de novo single base-pair transitions in the SRY conserved domain in 4 cases. Sex is determined by the presence or absence of a testisdetermining factor (TDF) encoded by a gene on the short arm of the Y chromosome (1). If this factor is present testes will be formed and the embryo will develop as a male. In its absence the fetal gonads will develop as ovaries. Certain XY individuals fail to form testes and, instead, develop as completely phenotypic females with dysgenetic streak gonads. It is probable on the basis of this phenotype that these individuals harbor mutations that disrupt the initial events in the testis-determining/differentiation pathway. A study of 3 XX males and an XX true hermaphrodite defined the location of TDF to a 35-kilobase (kb) sequence located immediately adjacent to the pseudoautosomal boundary (2). Within this region an open reading frame (ORF) was isolated that is part of the gene termed SRY (3). There is considerable evidence to suggest that SR Y encodes a factor necessary for the initiation of testis formation (3-5). In three studies of 40 XY females with gonadal dysgenesis, 5 individuals were found to harbor mutations in the SRY ORE, of which 4 were de novo (6-8). All mutations were present in the conserved domain of the SR Y ORE, which is related to the HMG box of the high mobility group proteins (9).

Here we describe the analysis of 25 XY females with pure gonadal dysgenesis (PGD) for mutations in the Y chromosome short arm proximal to the pseudoautosomal boundary, including SRY. In one case a deletion of at least 25 kb but no more than 50 kb was found in the Y chromosome short arm 5' to the SR Y HMG box. To our knowledge, no deletion has been reported previously on the Y short arm outside of the SRY HMG box. Denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed four individuals who harbored de novo single base-pair transitions in the conserved HMG-like box of SRY.  MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients. All patients were considered classical 46,XY females with PGD on the basis of (i) unambiguous female external genitalia, (ii) absence of differentiated gonads, only streak gonads being present, and (iii) presence of normally developed Mullerian structures, including uterus and fallo-  pian tubes. In each case there was no evidence of Turner stigmata, mental retardation, or short stature. Individuals AS, LG, and NV were from India, Portugal, and France, respectively. The remaining individuals were ascertained from France and North Africa. All cases were sporadic. There was no difference in the phenotypes between the sex-reversed females AS, LG, and NV. Histological examination of the streak gonad of individuals AS, LG, and NV revealed typical wavy ovarian-type stroma with no tubule structures present. NV also had a gonadoblastoma in her right streak gonad and, in certain areas, a spermatocytic seminoma. An aspect of embryonal carcinoma was observed in the left streak gonad stroma. Southern Analysis. Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood lymphocytes. Ten-microgram samples were digested with restriction endonucleases according to the manufacturer's recommended conditions. Agarose gel electrophoresis, transfer to nylon membranes (Hybond N, Amersham), prehybridization, hybridization to 32P-labeled probes, and autoradiography were performed essentially as described elsewhere (12). Blots were hybridized with the probes pY53.3, pDP1225, p09, pDP1226, and pDP1007 (2, 3, 13-15). Paternity was checked using minisatellite DNA probes (16). DGGE. Computer analysis was performed using the MELT87 and SQHTX programs provided by L. Lerman (17).

These computer algorithms predict the melting behavior of a DNA fragment on the basis of its base composition and its nucleotide sequence. This information was used to select positions of PCR primers located within the SR Y ORF, allowing generation of a fragment suitable for DGGE analysis. The primer sequences were SRYA (ACAAAGAATCTGGTAGAACGTGAG) and SRYD (GTAAGTGGCCTAGCTGGTG). The primer SRYD carried, at its 5' end, an additional (G+C)-rich oligomer (45-mer) needed to create a high-temperature melting domain (18). As a consequence, the SR Y sequence becomes the first melting domain and can be analyzed throughout. PCRs were performed using 50-100 ng of genomic DNA in a reaction mixture consisting of 200 tkM (each) dNTP, 0.1 ,uM (each) primer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), and two units of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase in a total volume of 50 1A. After initial denaturation at 940C for 4 mn, samples were subjected to 40 cycles of 1 min at 940C, 1 min at 550C, and 2 min at 72TC. Since the resolution of DGGE is increased by examining heteroduplexes, 10 gI of sample was mixed with 10 1L4 of a normal male control. Prior to loading on denaturing gels the samples were denatured (940C, 4 min) and then annealed (420C, 1 hr). The PCR products were electrophoresed in a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel with a linearly increasing gradient from 20% to 70% denaturant (100% denaturant is 7 M urea and 40%o formamide) at 160 V for 4 hr under conditions previously described (19). Direct DNA Sequencing. SRY genomic DNA fragments were asymmetrically amplified and directly sequenced using Sequenase (United States Biochemical) essentially as described elsewhere (20). Detection of Genomic Sequences Recognized by the Probe pYRO.4. Amplification of genomic DNA was performed using the primers R041 (GCGTGCTGCTAGCGCTATAT) and R04G (TCGATGTGGCTCCAAGTAGC), which generate an amplified product of 120 base pairs (bp). One hundred nanograms of genomic DNA was heated to 94° C for 4 min and then subjected to 30 cycles in a total volume of 100 IlI containing dNTPs (each at 200 ,uM), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 units of Taq polymerase, and each oligonucleotide at 0.25 uM. Each cycle consisted of 94° C for 1 min, 58° C for 1 min, and 72° C for 2 min. The extension step after the last cycle was for 10 min. PCR products were electrophoresed in a 1.3% agarose gel, transferred to Hybond N membrane, and hybridized with 32P end-labeled oligonucleotide R04K (CTATGCGCACCCGTTCTCGGAGC) following the manufacturer's recommended conditions. Detection of SRY, RPS4X, and RPS4Y Transcripts. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using random hexamers as described elsewhere (21). Primers used for detection of SRY expression were EVSRYA (AACAGCGATGATTACAGTCCAG) and SRYHMGB (TAGAGCCATCTTGCGCCTCTG). Primers used for the RPS4 amplifications were RPS4C (GCTGAGGGAATGTCTTCCTCTGAT), RPS4B (CCATGAATCCAGCAGGGTATGTGAT), and RPS42 (TTGATTATCTTGCCAGTCC). The primer RPS4C recognizes sequences common to RPS4X and RPS4 Y transcripts, whereas RPS4B and RPS42 are specific for RPS4X and RPS4Y transcripts, respectively. Amplification of RPS4X results in a fragment of 132 bp, whereas amplification ofRPS4Yresults in the generation of a fragment of 342 bp. In each amplification, 10 ng of cDNA was heated to 94° C for4 min and then subjected to 30 cycles in a total volume of 100 ,u containing all four dNTPs (each at 200 AuM), 1.0 mM MgCl2, 1 unit of Taq polymerase, and each oligonucleotide at 0.25 AM. Each cycle consisted of 940C for 1 min, 560C for 1 min, and 720C for 1 min.  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 (1992)  11017  RESULTS To check for the presence of mutations in the Y short arm adjacent to the pseudoautosomal boundary, DNA samples from XY females with PGD were screened by Southern hybridization using the probes pY53.3, pDP1225, p09, pDP1226, and pDP1007. The hybridization pattern observed for these probes was similar to that observed in DNA from a normal male in 24 of the 25 cases (data not shown). In one case (NV) a different hybridization pattern was observed compared to a normal male. This XY female had a Y-specific 2.1-kb HindIII fragment when probed with pY53.3, which recognizes sequences corresponding to SRY (Fig. 1). A fragment of similar size was detected in DNA from her father. Digestion of NV DNA with Stu I followed by probing with pY53.3 revealed a change in fragment size from 9 kb to 3 kb. An additional fragment of 6 kb was present in female NV, her father, and a normal male. Digestion with HindIII and probing with pDP1225, which recognizes Y-specific sequences 5' to SR Y, showed a reduction in fragment size compared to a normal male from 5.5 kb to 1.5 kb. This indicates that the deletion extends upstream from the SR Y HMG box and begins no more than -1.8 kb upstream from the first ATG of the SR Y ORE present in the clone pY53.3. Since the hybridization patterns for the father and the normal male were identical when probed with pY53.3 and pDP1226, it indicates that the change in band size was not due to a simple polymorphism and is de novo. The presence of a deletion in NV was confirmed using the probe p09. Probe p09 hybridizes to sequences =18 kb from the pseudoautosomal boundary. Sequences recognized by this probe were present in a normal male control and the father of NV but were absent in NV. Y-specific sequences recognized by the probe pYRO.4 were not detected by amplification of DNA from NV using the primers R041 and R04G followed by hybridization with the probe R04K. These sequences were detected in samples from her father and a normal male (Fig. 1). Hybridization patterns obtained using the Y-specific clones pDP1226 and pDP1007, which correspond to coding sequences of RSP4 Y and ZFY, were similar in samples from NV, her father, and a control male. The deletion present in NV therefore extends from -8 kb to at least 33 kb and no more than 60 kb from the Y pseudoautosomal boundary toward the centromere (Fig. 1). DGGE analysis of the SR Y ORF in NV and in a normal male showed that both were identical (data not shown). To determine if the deletion gave rise to ectopic SR Yexpression, reverse PCR was prepared from a lymphoblastoid cell line prepared from peripheral blood lymphocytes of NV. SRY expression was not detected in this cell line (data not shown). RPS4Y and RPS4X are ubiquitously transcribed (22). The transcriptional unit of RPS4 Y is in the opposite orientation to SR Y: transcription proceeds in the direction of the pseudoautosomal boundary toward the centromere. To determine if the deletion prevented induction of RPS4Y transcription, RPS4 Y-specific transcripts were detected by reverse transcriptase PCR. The primer RPS4C recognizes coding sequences present in RPS4X and RPS4 Y, whereas the primers RPS4B and RPS42 are RPS4X and RPS4 Y specific, respectively. Transcripts coding for RPS4X and RPS4Y were detected in cDNA prepared from RNA from normal male lymphocytes, whereas only transcripts coding for RPS4X could be detected in cDNA prepared from normal female lymphocytes (Fig. 2). Expression of RPS4X and RPS4 Y was detected in lymphoblastoid cells prepared from NV. The SRY coding sequences within the fragment pY53.3 were assayed for the presence of mutations by DGGE. DNA samples from four individuals showed heteroduplex formation (data not shown). Direct PCR sequencing of the SR Y  11018  Proc. Nad. Acad. Sci. USA 89 (1992)  Medical Sciences: McElreavey et al.

One individual was identified with a deletion in the Y chromosome short arm, immediately 5' of the SRY ORF. This deletion extended from =8 kb to at least 33 kb and no more than 60 kb upstream from the Y autosomal boundary toward the centromere. The deletion begins no more than 1.8 kb 5' ofthe first ATG of the SR YORF present in pY53.3. The known SRY coding sequences in this individual were identical to those present in a normal male. Reverse PCR analysis of SR Y expression in a lymphoblastoid cell line prepared from NV showed that the deletion did not result in ectopic SRY expression. Since the 5' extent of the SRY transcriptional unit has not been defined, it is probable that this deletion removes either an additional upstream exon and/or transcriptional regulatory motifs, either situation resulting in a lack of testicular determination during embryonic development. It cannot be formally excluded that the deletion removes a second gene necessary for testis determination as well as SRY. If such a gene exists, it must be present within 35 kb proximal to the pseudoautosomal boundary since this is the minimum amount of Y material present in certain XX males that can confer a male phenotype. However searches within this area based on sequence conservation between different mammalian species have failed to detect any such  gene(s). The deletion in female NV extends from 5' to the SRY HMG box to the 5' part of the gene RPS4Y. This gene encodes 1 of 33 proteins that make up the small subunit of the  Medical Sciences:  McElreavey et aL  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

It has been suggested that haploinsufficiency of RPS4 genes may contribute to the Turner phenotype. Turner syndrome females are characterized by short stature, gonadal dysgenesis, and various anatomic abnormalities (24). Deletion analysis of certain XY females with and without the somatic abnormalities characteristic of Turner syndrome has indicated that the Turner phenotype maps to interval 1 or 2 of the Y short arm (25, 26). Within this region the gene RPS4Y has been cloned. Individual NV presented with PGD without any of the somatic abnormalities associated with Turner syndrome. If the presence of RPS4Y prevents features characteristic of the Turner phenotype, the RPS4Ytranscriptional unit must be conserved. Using reverse PCR techniques, RPS4Y- and RPS4X-specific transcripts were detected in normal male lymphocytes and a cell line prepared from female NV. This indicates that the deletion does not prevent induction of RPS4Y transcription, although it cannot be excluded that the level of RPS4Yexpression in NV is reduced compared to a normal male. Expression of RPS4Y in NV is consistent with the hypothesis that RPS4Y prevents some of the somatic features characteristic of the Turner phenotype. Detailed mapping of this deletion may help define the RPS4Y transcriptional unit. The SR Y ORF was analyzed for mutations by DGGE in all 25 XY females. Four cases were found who harbored mutations in the SRYORF, each present in the HMG box. Two of these cases were previously described (6, 23). The two new mutations were de novo, single base-pair substitutions, which resulted in the generation of a stop codon and a conservative isoleucine to threonine amino acid change. The introduction of a stop codon in the HMG box would almost certainly result in a nonfunctional SR Y gene product. The conservative isoleucine to threonine amino acid change occurs at a position whose amino acid residue is variable between HMG box proteins; nevertheless, since the mutation is de novo and associated with an XY female phenotype, the amino acid change presumably alters the functional activity of SRY. There are now seven reported cases of 46,XY sex-reversed females harboring de novo mutations in the SRY ORF. Each mutation is present in the conserved HMG-like box and hence may affect the DNA-binding activity of the protein.  Sex reversal in the remaining XY females with no detectable mutations in the testis-determining region of the Y short arm may be caused by X chromosomal or autosomal mutations in the male sex-determining/differentiation pathway. Familial cases of sex reversal have been described compatible with X-linked recessive and autosomal recessive patterns of inheritance (27). Alternatively, it is possible that some of these individuals harbor mutations in other exons/promoter elements that are necessary for proper SR Y function and expression and that were not detected by Southern blotting used in this study. Note Added in Proof. While this manuscript was in press, Vilain et al. (28) defined the SRY transcription initiation site at -91 bp upstream from the first ATG present in the clone pY53.3. The deletion is therefore -1.7 kb 5' to the SRY transcription initiation site.  We are grateful to Dr. J. J. Battin, Dr. G. Bercau, Dr. H. Chaabouni, Dr. Y. Darbois, Dr. N. Fekete, Dr. A.

A candidate gene for human sex determination (SRY) was isolated in this region. Here, we describe a study of 25 cases of XY females with pure gonadal dysgenesis for mutations on the Y chromosome short arm, including SRY. Southern blotting revealed a sex-reversed female harboring a deletion extending from approximately 8 kb from the pseudoautosomal boundary of the Y chromosome to at least 33 kb and no more than 60 kb upstream, toward the centromere. The deletion begins no more than 1.8 kb upstream from the first ATG of the SRY open reading frame present in the clone pY53.3. To our knowledge, no mutation has been described previously outside the SRY "HMG box" on the short arm of the Y chromosome, which is associated with sex reversal. Since the 5' extent of the SRY transcriptional unit has not been defined, the deletion may remove upstream exons of SRY and/or transcriptional regulatory motifs, either situation resulting in lack of testicular development. It cannot be formally excluded that the mutation removes a second locus, independent of SRY, that is critical for sex determination. Denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the SRY open reading frame in the remaining 24 cases revealed de novo single base-pair transitions in the SRY conserved domain in 4 cases."
"1","Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant susceptibility to a variety of cancers including carcinomas of the breast and the adrenal cortex, tumors of brain and muscle tissue, and leukemias. Affected individuals develop cancer at a young age and often at multiple primary sites. A study has been conducted into the genetic basis of cancer in a particular Li-Fraumeni syndrome family. Examination of p53 as a candidate susceptibility gene revealed that, in two affected individuals, there was an aberrant larger transcript of 3.6 kilobases present in both tumor and constitutional material in addition to the normal-sized 2.8-kilobase transcript. The additional transcript was not found in three unaffected family members. S1 nuclease mapping localized the insertion toward the 5' end of the p53 transcript near exons 4 and 5, and sequencing revealed a point mutation in the splice donor site of intron 4 in the germ-line of the two affected individuals, which accounted for the presence of the larger transcript. The same splicing mutation was also detected in two obligate carriers and was not found in two unaffected individuals. As no mutations were detected in exons 5-8 in either tumor examined, the second p53 allele was most likely lost during tumorigenesis in both tumors.

Affeded individuals develop cancer at a young age and often at multiple primary sites. A study has been conduded into the genetic basis of cancer in a particular Li-Fraumeni syndrome family.

Less common are non-sense mutations, such as splice site mutations, and frameshift mutations, the latter being due to insertions and deletions (3) which may not produce any protein at all. The p53 gene has been highly conserved throughout evolution. The interspecies regions of homology are concentrated into five conserved blocks (I-V) (1 -4), and it is within these conserved blocks (particularly II-V) that most of the human cancer mutations occur (1-3, 5). Recently, germ-line mutations of this gene have been identified in affected members of families with LFS4 (3, 6, 7), predisposing them to cancer. LFS is a familial cancer syndrome with affected individuals exhibiting a spectrum of cancers, including premenopausal breast carcinomas, soft tissue sarcomas, brain tumors, osteosarcomas, leukemias, and adrenocortical carcinomas. These cancers have an early age of onset, and the development of multiple primary tumors is common. Segregation analysis of these tumors is consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance (8-10). The first documented inherited p53 mutations in LFS families were tightly clustered in exon 7, codons 245-258, within conserved block IV (6, 7). It was later shown that the predisposing mutations in the p53 gene were not always restricted to that specific codon cluster (3, 11-13). In one family, the germ-line p53 mutation was a point mutation at codon 1 33 in exon 5, within conserved block II (12). Another report descnibed a single base deletion at codon 307 in one family and a point mutation at codon 286 in another family, both mutations being in exon 8 (1 3). Excepting the single base deletion which leads to a premature stop codon in exon 10, all of these point mutations cause nonconservative amino acid substitutions in the protein produced, presumably leading to a loss of function or altered function ofthe protein (1, 2). A germ-line p53 mutation was detected in a patient with ependymoma, a tumor not usually associated with LFS, at codon 242, within the “hotspot” region (14). Studies of young patients with second malignancies (15) and patients with sarcoma (16) have shown germ-line p53 mutations in some individuals, most commonly in the exon 7 hotspot region, but also mutations at codon 325 in exon 9 (15) and codon 282 in exon 8 (15, 16) and a 1-bp insertion in exon 6 (16), even though these mdividuals do not necessarily have a family history of malig-  4  The abbreviations  plementary  kilobase(s).

Pedigree of a Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome family.

This pedigree is a modification of one previously published (33). Fig.  .0,  nancy or a history that conforms to the diagnostic criteria for LFS. As the p53 protein levels in LFS cells appear to be equivalent to or lower than those in normal cells (6), it seems likely that the LFS p53 mutations result in proteins that are functionally distinct from the more common hsc7o-binding, highly expressed, mutant p53 proteins which exert a transdominant loss of function” effect on the wild-type p53 protein encoded by the remaining normal allele (1-3, 6, 17-22). That is, although the LFS p53 mutations yield abnormal proteins, functional loss of the second allele may still be necessary for total mactivation of p53 function. The p53 mutations observed in LFS are not unique to LFS. All of the germ-line p53 mutations reported to date have also been observed in sporadic tumors (3, 6, 7, 11-16). We report here the detection of a germ-line point mutation in the splice donor site of intron 4 in affected family members and obligate carriers in one LFS family. We have previously shown that an adrenocortical carcinoma occurring in one family member had overexpression of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (23). The p53 splice site mutation described here results in the retention of intron 4 in the mature p53 mRNA, resulting in a larger transcript. This is the first report of a germ-line splice site mutation in p53 and is the most 5’ germ-line p53 mutation to date. Results Detection of a Larger p53 Transcript. In order to determine whether p53 was involved in the etiology of the cancer susceptibility in this family (Fig. 1), we examined the expression of this gene in patient cells and tissues, in parallel with sequencing studies. Fig. 2A shows Northern blot analysis of p53 expression in patient IIIC’s breast carcinoma, IVB’s adrenocortical carcinoma and skin fibroblasts, and peripheral blood from IIIB, IVA, and IVG. RNA from affected individuals IIIC and IVB exhibited a larger p53 transcript of approximately 3.6 kb in addition to a normal-sized transcript of 2.8 kb in both tumor and constitutional material. Both transcripts were present in IlIC’s stromal fibroblasts and IVB’s peripheral blood (data not shown). Unaffected individuals IlIB, IVA, and IVG all  G  showed only the normal-sized transcript, 2.8 kb, as did the control, MRC-5 fibroblasts. A summary of the p53 transcript data for all family members examined in this study is given in Table 1 Because the larger p53 transcript was present in both tumor material and the germ-line of two affected individuals tested, we postulated that it represented the underlying genetic lesion in this family. Possibilities for increased transcript size are gene rearrangement or a splicing aberration resulting in retention of an intron in the message. No obvious gene rearrangement was observed by restriction analysis and Southern hybridization to the p53 cDNA probe (data not shown). Two introns, namely introns 4 and 10, are of approximately the right size, 755 bp and 920 bp, respectively, to account for the size difference in transcripts.5 Using a 3’ end-labeled p53 cDNA, we were able to perform Si nuclease mapping to localize the insertion to approximately 550 bp from the 5’ end of the p53 cDNA. As can be seen in Fig. 2B, the control, MRC-S RNA, showed a single band of approximately 1 .8 kb upon hybridization and Si nuclease digestion, representing the portion ofthe p53 transcript identical to the cDNA probe. Hybridization of IVB’s RNA to the labeled p53 cDNA probe and digestion with 51 nuclease produced two bands. The first band was identical in size to that in the control and represented the normal-sized p53 transcript. The second band was approximately 550 bp in size and represented the larger transcript digested at the point of insertion. The location of the insertion toward the 5’ end of the p53 transcript indicates that the likely insertion point would involve intron 4 rather than intron 10. Sequence Analysis of p53. The sequence analysis had two main objectives: to identify the mutation responsible for the larger transcript and to determine whether this family had any other germ-line p53 mutations, either in exon 7, the previously reported location of LFS mutations, or elsewhere in the gene. To determine whether the cause of the larger transcript in the affected individuals was retention of an intron, the splice donor and acceptor sites of introns 4 and 10 were .  p, Chumakov, V. P.

Fragments representing the introns in their entirety were generated from affected individuals’ genomic DNA using primers complementary to the flanking exonic sequences and the polymerase chain reaction. The fragments were either cloned and sequenced or directly sequenced. In each case in which cloning of PCR products was used, sequencing was carried out on six different clones representing separate reactions. These precautions were taken to guard against sequence discrepancies caused by base misinconporations by Taq polymerase. In all cases, both strands were sequenced. The sequences of both the splice donor and splice acceptor sites of intron 10 were determined to be wildtype in all clones sequenced, by comparison with the published sequences (data not shown). The splice accepton site of intron 4 was also found to be wild-type in all clones (data not shown), but the sequence of the splice donor site of intron 4 revealed a base change of a guanine to an adenine at the -1 position of the splice consensus sequence (Fig. 3; Table 2). This base change was observed in both tumor (Fig. 3, A and B) and fibroblast DNA (data not shown) from the probands IIIC and IVB and also in peripheral blood DNA from obligate carriers IVE and VB (Fig. 3C), the father and identical twin of VA, respectively (see Fig. 1 ). The base change was not found in peripheral blood DNA sequenced from unaffected individuals, IIIB or IVA (data not shown). In IIIC’s tumor DNA, sequenced directly, both adenine and guanine were present at the -1 position in the splice consensus sequence (Fig. 3B). Table 1 summarizes the sequencing results obtained for the 5’ splice site of intron 4 in family members. The base change was observed in five of six clones derived from IVB’s tumor DNA, and one clone was wild-type. In IVB’s fibroblast DNA, 50% of clones had the mutated base, and 50% had the wild-type guanme,  .  prediction  mutation.  Consti-  tutional DNAs from other individuals (IlIC’s fibroblast DNA and IVE and VB peripheral blood DNA) were also heterozygous for the mutation. To address the question of the involvement of previously reported LFS mutations, an exon 7 fragment was generated by PCR from genomic DNA, and both strands were sequenced directly. No point mutations were detected in exon 7 in tumor or peripheral blood DNA from probands IIIC and IVB, or in peripheral blood DNA from obligate carriers IVE and VB or unaffected individual IlIB (Table 1). In addition, fragments representing exons 5-8 were generated by PCR from IIIC’s and IVB’s tumor DNA and sequenced directly. No point mutations were ob-  served apart from the intron 4 splice site mutation (Tables 1 and 2). This lack of another point mutation in the p53 hotspot regions makes it more likely that the inactivation of the remaining wild-type p53 alleles in tumonigenesis has occurred by loss rather than mutation in the case of IVB’s tumor. It is possible that the inactivation of the wild-type p53 allele in IIIC’s tumor was caused by a mutation in the regions of the p53 gene that were not sequenced in this study, that is, exons 1 -4 and 9-1 1. These regions are less frequently mutated in human tumors than exons 5-8 (1 -3, 5). Discussion The involvement of p53 in the genetics of LFS has been previously demonstrated (3, 6, 7, 1 1 -1 3). We have analyzed the expression of p53 in certain members of an LFS family, and observed the presence of a 3.6-kb transcript, in addition to the normal-sized 2.8-kb transcript. The larger transcript was observed in the RNA of tumor and fibroblast material from two individuals, IIIC and IVB, and was therefore germ-line. Only the normal-sized transcript was found in peripheral blood RNA from unaffected individuals, IIIB, IVA, and IVG. We considered the most likely cause ofthe aberrant transcript to be a splicing mutation resulting in the retention of all or part of an intron in the mature mRNA. Although missense point mutations are by far the most common mutation in the p53 gene, splicing mutations have been reported in sporadic tumors. They have been mostly detected in lung carcinomas in introns 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9 (3, 24-27) and in leukemias in introns 4 and S (3, 28, 29). Based on size, the most likely introns to be included in the larger transcript were 4 and 10. Evidence from 51 nuclease mapping indicated that intron 4 was present in the message. PCR and sequencing confirmed that intron 4 had a point mutation in the splice donor site in both affected individuals IIIC and IVB’s tumor and fibroblast DNA. These were the individuals in which the 3.6-kb transcript was detected. Upon sequencing other family members, we found the same point mutation in the peripheral blood DNA from obligate carriers IVE and VB. In peripheral blood DNA from unaffected individuals, IIIB and IVA, the sequence for intron 4 and surrounding sequence was wild-type. The mutation was a guanine to adenine transition at position -1 in the splice donor consensus sequence. This base is nonessential for splicing to occur, unlike the CT dinucleotide, the first two bases of the intron (30).

In A, one intron 4 clone from IVB’s adrenocortical carcinoma DNA shows the point mutation at position -1 of the splice consensus sequence in the sense (5) and antisense (AS) strands. The mutant sequence (mut) has an adenine (A) at this position, whereas the wild-type sequence (wt) has a guanine (C). The wild-type clone shown here was the only one of the six sequenced. In B, IIIC’s breast carcinoma DNA also shows the guanine to adenine mutation in the splice donor site, the wild-type base, guanine, is present in a similar proportion to the mutant base, adenine. This sequence was derived directly from six pooled PCR samples. In C, peripheral blood DNA from obligate carriers, tvc and VB, shows both the guanine and the adenine in approximately equal intensities. This sequence was also derived from six pooled PCR samples.  the intron 4 splice donor sequence of p53 is atypical, having a cytosine at position 3 ofthe consensus sequence instead of an adenine or a guanine. This means that the wild-type intron 4 splice donor site has only seven of nine bases matching the consensus sequence. With the guanine to adenine transition at position -1, the match is decreased to six of nine bases, which is probably sufficient to disrupt splicing at this site. That site sequence can disrupt splicing has been a report of the same guanine to adenine  such a splice indicated by transition at  position -1 in the splice donor site of intron 4 in a T-cell leukemia disrupting splicing and resulting in an aberrant transcript of 3.5 kb (29). To exclude the possibility that this splice site mutation was a polymorphism or a rare alternate splicing product, that is, a marker for the affected allele with no biological effect, not the predisposing lesion, we sequenced exons 5-8. All Li-Fraumeni syndrome or germ-line p53 mutations reported to date have fallen within the region covered by exons 5-8 (1-3, 6, 7, 11-16), with the exception of the mutation reported here in exon 4 and one other, in the first codon of exon 9 (14).

Loss of all wild-type p53 function in the tumor could have also have occurred by mutation of the wild-type p53 in regions of the gene outside those already sequenced. In the tumor material from IVB, which was sequenced after cloning, five of six clones had the mutant base, adenine, indicating a probable loss of the wild-type p53 allele in the tumor and stromal tissue infiltration causing the low background of wild-type sequence, whereas the mutant p53 allele remained present. Another alternative to explain the presence of a lower amount of wild-type transcript in IVB’s tumor is a gene dosage effect caused by the copy numbers of chromosome 1 7, the chromosome to which the p53 gene is localized (31-33). IVB’s tumor has three copies of chromosome 1 7” two of which could be mutant and one which could be wild-type, causing the lower signal intensity  for  tumor IVB’s  the  wild-type  has four tumor,  base,  copies  guanine.  Individual  of chromosome  has similar  signal  17  intensities  IIIC’s  but,  for the  unlike mutant  and wild-type bases (Fig. 3B). If this implies equal copy numbers of “wild-type” and mutant chromosomes, then inactivation of the wild-type p53 may have occurred by mutation in exons outside those sequenced in this study. This is the first report of an inherited splicing mutation in the p53 gene. This mutation lies in conserved block II, upstream of the exon S (conserved block II also) mutation reported in a LFS family (12), and represents the most 5’ LFS mutation  reported  to date  (Fig.  4). It is interesting  to  note that although LFS families show a diverse range of tumors, not all families develop all of the hallmark types of tumors. For example, in the LFS family reported here, there have been no documented soft tissue sarcomas in the five generations shown (Fig. 1), but there have been two cases of adrenocortical carcinoma in the one family. In other families, there are no adrenocortical carcinomas but a preponderance of soft tissue sarcomas (6-8). Pos-  A. Smith, unpublished 7 S. Pittman,  ‘,  data.  S. Warneford, data. S.

The pedigree of the family examined in this study is given in Fig. 1 The probands were IIIC and IVB. IIlC’s first tumor was an adrenocortical carcinoma followed by premenopausal breast carcinoma, and her son IVB also had an adrenocortical carcinoma. Adrenocontical carcinoma is a rare tumor which occurs more frequently in LFS families than it does in the general population (9, 10, 13, 34, 35). From discussions with family members and, where possible, by confirmation of hospital records, the pedigree spanning five generations was compiled. The types of tumors, the ages of onset, and the inheritance pattern in this family are consistent with the diagnostic criteria for the LFS cancer family syndrome (8-10). The clinical histories of the two probands, IIIC and IVB, have been described in a previous publication (23). The inheritance appears to stem from the maternal side of the family, beginning with IIIC’s grandfather, IE, who died in his thirties from leukemia, although it has not been possible to confirm this by examination of archival pathology material. The contnibution of the paternal relatives of individual IVB (that is, relatives of IIIC’s husband, IlIB) to IVB’s cancer predisposition is not known. The types of tumors and their ages of onset are not consistent with LFS. Tumors and Cell Culture. The tissues used for analysis were as follows. A breast carcinoma from IIIC (23) and an adrenocortical carcinoma from IVB (23) were received as surgical specimens and processed immediately for DNA and/or RNA as described below. Peripheral blood was obtained from IIIB, IVA, IVB, IVE, IVG, and VB. The cell lines/strains used were: IIIC’s stromal fibroblasts, IVB’s skin fibroblasts, MRC-S human embryonic lung fibroblasts (36), and SW-13 human adrenocortical adenocarcinoma cells (37). IlIC and IVB’s fibroblasts were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. MRC-S fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, and SW-i 3 cells were kept in L-1 S medium. MRC-S and SW13 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal .  Cell Growth  Table  3  PCR and sequencing  The sequence  in bold within  845  primers Primer  a  & Differentiation  Primer  Intron  4 left PCR  Intron  4 right  sequence  PCR’  Exon 5 Exon 5 Exon 5 Exon S  left PCR left sequence right PCR right sequence  TGT’FCACTTGTGCCCTGACT  Exon Exon Exon Exon  6 6 6 6  left PCR left sequence right PCR right sequence  TGGTTGCCCAGGGTCCCCAG  Exon Exon Exon Exon  7 7 7 7  left PCR left sequence right PCR right sequence  CTTGCCACAGGTCTCCCCAA AGGCGCACTGGCCTCATCTT  Exon Exon Exon Exon  8 8 8 8  left PCR left sequence right PCR right sequence  T1GGGAGTAGATGGAGCCT  the intron  4 primers  5’ to 3’  GTAGGAATICGTCTGGGCTTCVFGCKVFC CATCGAATCGGCAGGTCTFGGCCAGTFGG  TFCAACTCTGTCTCCTTCCT AGCAATCAGTGAGGAATCAG CAGCCCTGTCOTCTCTCCAG  GCCTCTGATTCCTCACTGAT  TGGAGGGCCACTGACAACCA TTAACCCCTCCTCCCAGAGA  AGGGGTCAGCGGCAAGCAGA  TGTGCAGGGTGGCAAGTGGC  rrccrrAci’GccrcrrGcrr AGTGTTAGACTGGAAAC1Tf AGGCATAACTGCACCC11GG  indicates  the EcoRl site to facilitate  calf serum, 100 units/mI of penicillin, and 200 jag/mI of streptomycin, and cells were grown at 37#{176}C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. DNA and RNA Isolation. Lymphocytes for DNA and/ or RNA were obtained from peripheral blood samples by separation on a Ficoll-Hypaque (Phanmacia) density gradient. Total RNA and/on genomic DNA was isolated by gently homogenizing minced tumor tissue in guanidmnium isothiocyanate or by lysing cultured cells or lymphocytes in guanidmnium isothiocyanate (38), followed by separation on a cesium chloride gradient (38). Cenomic DNA without RNA was isolated by standard techniques. Northern Analysis and Si Nuclease Mapping. In general, for Northern analysis, 10-jag samples of total RNA were size fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of formaldehyde, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized to the p53 cDNA probe labeled with [a-32P]dCTP. The p53 probe used in this study was a 1.8-kb Xbal fragment gel purified from the plasmid pLSVhpS3c62 (39) and labeled by random priming (40). All hybridizations were carried out at 42#{176}C in 50% formamide. The 51 nuclease mapping was carried out using standard techniques (38). Total RNA from the affected individual on control was hybridized to the p53 cDNA. The same Xbal fragment of pLSVhpS3c62 was used, except that it was labeled by 3’ end labeling with [a-32P] dCTP (38). The molecular size markers used were the fragments generated from a Hint) digest of pBR322, 5’ end labeled with [‘y-32P}dATP (38). Reactions were analyzed on denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 M urea. Both Northern blots and Si nuclease gels were visualized by autoradiography. PCR and Sequencing Analysis. The PCR primers used are summarized in Table 3. For PCR amplification, in general, genomic DNA (0.5 jag) was incubated in a total volume of 50 jal of solution containing SO mt’i KCI, 10 mM Tnis-CI (pH 8.3), 1.5 mti MgCI2, 200 jaM each of the four deoxynibonucleotides, 200 pmol oligonucleotide primers, and 3.75 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). For PCR of introns 4 and 10, templates were denatured at 95#{176}C for 1 mm 20 s, followed  cloning.  by 35 cycles of PCR with 2 mm of primer annealing at 70#{176}C, 3 mm of extension at 72#{176}C, and 1 mm of denaturation at 94#{176}C. The intron 4 and 10 PCR products were then cloned into pCEM-3Z and sequenced using the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method (41), modified for sequencing close to the primers, using the PCR primers as sequencing primers. The intron 4 and 10 PCR products were sequenced by one of two strategies. Either six PCR reactions were cloned and sequenced separately or, alternatively, six PCR reactions were pooled and sequenced directly using the fmol Cycle Sequencing Kit (Promega Corp.). For PCR of exons 5-8, primers for both PCR and sequencing and the PCR protocol were as described (42, 43). In all cases, six PCR reactions were pooled, and PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, then purified from the agarose by Magic PCR Preps (Promega Corp.) or Geneclean (Bio 101,  La Jolla,  CA).

"1","Six different substitution mutations were identified in four different amino acid residues of antithrombin strand 1C and the polypeptide leading into strand 4B (F402S, F402C, F402L, A404T, N405K, and P407T), and are responsible for functional antithrombin deficiency in seven independently ascertained kindreds (Rosny, Torino, Maisons-Laffitte, Paris 3, La Rochelle, Budapest 5, and Oslo) affected by venous thromboembolic disease. In all seven families, variant antithrombins with heparin-binding abnormalities were detected by crossed immunoelectrophoresis, and in six of the kindreds there was a reduced antigen concentration of plasma antithrombin. Two of the variant antithrombins, Rosny and Torino, were purified by heparin-Sepharose and immunoaffinity chromatography, and shown to have greatly reduced heparin cofactor and progressive inhibitor activities in vitro. The defective interactions of these mutants with thrombin may result from proximity of s1C to the reactive site, while reduced circulating levels may be related to s1C proximity to highly conserved internal beta strands, which contain elements proposed to influence serpin turnover and intracellular degradation. In contrast, s1C is spatially distant to the positively charged surface which forms the heparin binding site of antithrombin; altered heparin binding properties of s1C variants may therefore reflect conformational linkage between the reactive site and heparin binding regions of the molecule. This work demonstrates that point mutations in and immediately adjacent to strand 1C have multiple, or pleiotropic, effects on this serpin, leading ultimately to failure of its regulatory function.Pleiotropic effects of antithrombin strand 1C substitution mutations.Pleiotropic Effects of Antithrombin Strand 1C Substitution Mutations David A.

The defective interactions of these mutants with thrombin may result from proximity of s1C to the reactive site, while reduced circulating levels may be related to siC proximity to highly conserved internal ft strands, which contain elements proposed to influence serpin turnover and intracellular degradation. In contrast, siC is spatially distant to the positively charged surface which forms the heparin binding site of antithrombin; altered heparin binding properties of siC variants may therefore reflect conformational linkage between the reactive site and heparin binding regions of the molecule. This work demonstrates that point mutations in and immediately adjacent to strand 1C have multiple, or pleiotropic, effects on this serpin, leading ultimately to failure of its regulatory function.

Key words: serpin * variant * heparin * thrombin * deficiency * antithrombin III Introduction Antithrombin is a member of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) superfamily ( 1 ). Its main function is the regulation of blood coagulation proteinases, such as thrombin, that are generated during coagulation activation (2-4). Antithrombin has two distinct functional domains: one (the reactive site) interacts with the proteinase, and the other binds to heparin. MainteAddress correspondence to David A.

Volume 90, December 1992, 2422-2433 2422  Lane et al.  nance of an adequate level, > 70%, of functional antithrombin activity in blood is essential to ensure effective inhibition of coagulation proteinases: inheritance of genetic defects that lower the absolute amount of antithrombin (type I), or that produce inactive (variant) forms of the inhibitor (type II), predispose to familial thrombotic disorders (5, 6). Numerous variants ofantithrombin have now been characterized at the molecular level (7). Mutations that alter the reactive site (types Ha and HIb) are generally located near the COOH terminus of the molecule, while heparin binding defects (type IIc) (classification according to Sas et al. [8, 9 ] ) are usually caused by single amino acid substitutions near the NH2 terminus. We have studied seven different families in which the propositi suffered thromboembolic disorders and were found to have reduced levels of functional antithrombin. We show here that variant proteins are produced in each case and we identify the genetic abnormalities responsible for the altered functional properties of the antithrombins. Amongst these seven families, there are six different point mutations leading to single amino acid substitutions in the 402-407 region of the antithrombin protein. These substitutions have pleiotropic (multiple) effects; they alter the reactive site and heparin-binding properties of the variant antithrombins, and decrease their circulating levels in most cases.  Methods  Family histories The descriptions of the family histories that follow should be considered together with the antithrombin assay results summarized in Table I.  Case I 18-yr-old male from the town of Rosny, France, was referred for  An  investigation in August 1989, because of a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).' At the age of 15 yr, he developed a spontaneous superficial vein thrombosis of the right leg. 2 yr later, he had a DVT (diagnosed by venography), 7 d after appendectomy. He was treated with heparin, followed by oral anticoagulants for a period of 7 mo. Repeated echo-Doppler studies showed persistence of obstruction of the left superficial femoral and iliac veins. Antithrombin deficiency was diagnosed on the basis of reduced levels of activity and antigen in plasma, with the former being consistently lower than the latter (activity 52%, antigen 70%). His mother, aged 37 yr, originating from Gabon, also has antithrombin deficiency (activity 46%, antigen 60%). She had a clinically diagnosed left calf vein thrombosis at the age of 26 yr, while receiving estroprogestogen. It should be noted that she has had three pregnancies 1. Abbreviations used in this paper: CIE, crossed immunoelectrophoresis; DVT, deep vein thrombosis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.  without prophylactic anticoagulant treatment (one before and two after the thrombosis) and that she also received estroprogestogen after her second pregnancy: no other episodes of thrombosis were observed. The propositus has no contact with his father who could not therefore be examined.  Case 2 A 16-yr-old male from Torino, Italy, was referred for investigation after a DVT of the right leg. Possible predisposing events were repeated trauma of the same leg 1 wk and 1 mo before. The thrombosis was confirmed by echo-Doppler and computerized tomography: popliteal, superficial femoral, and iliac veins were occluded. He was treated first with urokinase together with heparin. Levels of antithrombin were determined to be low (activity 46%, antigen 69%) and were taken to indicate increased consumption; consequently, he received antithrombin concentrates ( 1,000 U on day 2; 2,000 U on day 3; 3,000 U from day 5-10). Warfarin was started on day 10 and heparin stopped on day 13. Oral anticoagulants were continued for 6 mo. Echo-Doppler performed at 4 mo showed a thrombosis up to the iliac vein and a collateral circulation by the internal saphenous vein. Antithrombin levels in his parents and his sister were normal and there was no family history of thrombosis.  Case 3 This involves an affected man (activity 56%, antigen 73%) from Maisons-Laffitte, France, with only one episode ofleft calfvein thrombosis at the age of 55 yr. He was referred for familial thromboembolic antecedents: his sister, aged 40 yr, developed a left ilio-femoral venous thrombosis with pulmonary embolism at the age of 28 yr, after a knee ligamentoplasty performed without interruption of estroprogestative pill. She was treated with oral anticoagulants for 2 yr without a further episode of thrombosis. At the age of 30 yr, she received prophylactic anticoagulant treatment for 2 yr after knee surgery. Despite her thrombosis, her antithrombin levels in plasma appear to be normal (activity 105%, antigen 104%). An affected (antithrombin activity 55%, antigen 75%) son of the propositus, 32 yr old, developed a spontaneous left ilio-femoral thrombosis at the age of 17 yr. He was treated with heparin followed by oral anticoagulants for 2 yr. 10 yr later he developed a spontaneous ilio-femoral thrombosis and for the last 3 yr has been treated with acenocoumarol, without recurrence of thrombotic episodes. Two other sons, 26 and 18 yr old, have no history ofthrombosis and their antithrombin levels are normal. A 25-yr-old unaffected (i.e., with normal antithrombin levels) nephew (son of an unaffected brother), however, presented with a left calfvein thrombosis after appendectomy at the age of 17 yr. After 1 yr of treatment on acenocoumarol, this was discontinued and he has been free of recurrences for 3 yr. The occurrence of thrombosis in this third family, often present in association with normal antithrombin levels, suggests a second independent abnomality, the nature of which is presently unknown.  Case 4 The propositus of the antithrombin Paris 3 kindred is a 41-yr-old male (antithrombin activity 48%, antigen 72%). At the age of 20 yr he had a fracture of the right malleolus which required a plaster cast for 40 ds: calf oedema followed cast removal. At the age of 35 yr, surgery was planned for inguinal hernia and, as his mother and two sisters were also known to be antithrombin deficient (Table I), he was examined for thrombosis by echo-Doppler: signs of previous right femoro-popliteal thrombosis were found. At the age of 39 yr, he experienced superficial thrombosis which was treated with a low molecular weight heparin. After another thrombotic episode, echo-Doppler demonstrated sequelae of right and left side DVT. Consequently, he has been put on long-term oral anticoagulants. One affected sister (antithrombin activity 60%, antigen 78%), aged 44 yr, has had repeated DVT and pulmonary embolism after deliveries and an induced abortion. A second affected sister (activity 54%, antigen 70%), aged 51 yr has had no thrombosis, despite having three  children. One ofthese children is antithrombin deficient (activity 58%, antigen 65%) and has had a DVT. Furthermore, the mother of the propositus, 71 yr, had postpartum superficial thrombosis at 17 yr, followed by a second thrombosis during the next pregnancy. At 62 yr she experienced ilio-femoral thrombosis, which was treated with long-term oral anticoagulants.  Case 5 The propositus (antithrombin activity 55%, antigen 73%) of the antithrombin La Rochelle kindred had repeated sprains between the ages of 17 and 28 yr, the last one being associated with pain and oedema. Diagnosis of DVT was suggested for the first time when he was 28 yr, after leg pain. Repeated episodes of dyspnoea culminated in investigation by venography, which revealed a previous left and recent right thrombosis. He received heparin, and during treatment a pulmonary embolism was confirmed by lung scan. Urokinase/plasminogen treatment was given and a vena caval interruption was performed. For the last 14 yr, he has been given oral anticoagulants. His mother, who also has reduced antithrombin levels (activity 55%, antigen 54%), is now 67 yr old and experienced no thrombotic problems following an appendectomy at 18 yr and her first three pregnancies. She experienced a left DVT after the fourth delivery and has had repeated episodes of superficial thrombophlebitis. She is not treated with long-term oral anticoagulants. His sister (antithrombin activity 56%, antigen 60%), aged 44 yr, developed a left calf DVT at 22 yr: thrombosis was associated with prolonged bed rest after influenza. She was treated with heparin for 48 h and oral anticoagulants were begun, but the DVT extended up the thigh and into the pelvis. Heparin was given again and after a move to oral anticoagulants she developed a DVT of the right leg. Additional episodes of DVT were investigated by venography, which revealed extensive thrombosis of the right femoral, external, and common iliac veins. Recurrency of thrombosis after stopping anticoagulants has lead to oral anticoagulation for the past 20 yr.  Case 6 This involves a family from Budapest, Hungary, with an extensive pedigree and a history of severe thrombotic episodes. A combination of at least two defects (antithrombin and protein C deficiencies), which apparently segregate separately, can explain the severe thrombosis. A comprehensive report of the family history has appeared elsewhere (10). While only the propositus was investigated in the present study (antithrombin activity 70%, antigen 100%), it is instructive to review briefly the family history. Of 10 brothers and 2 sisters, at least 2 siblings died of pulmonary embolism at an early age (21 and 16 yr). Two other children died without definite (autopsy) diagnosis. Four other family members with functional antithrombin deficiency suffered from severe thromboembolism at 15, 19, 23, and 46 yr and survived. Three family members (the grandmother and two brothers) with functional antithrombin deficiency have not developed thrombosis. Available antithrombin levels, including those reported elsewhere ( 10), are listed in Table I.  Case 7 Case 7 involves an antithrombin deficient kindred from Oslo, Norway. Details of the family history are contained in a report ( 11 ) that was the first to recognize an association between inherited antithrombin deficiency and venous thrombosis. More recently, Hultin et al. ( 12) analyzed plasma from members of this family by crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) in the presence of heparin and observed a cathodal variant protein in affected individuals. While the inheritance of antithrombin deficiency and its association with thrombosis is well documented in this family, a brief updated summary is required. The propositus (antithrombin activity 50%, antigen 48%) has had several, severe thromboses involving obstruction of the mesenteric veins, necessitating removal of much of his small bowel. Of 25 family members investigated, 12 were found to have functional antithrombin deficiency (see Table I). Eight of these individuals have had DVT, and in seven  Antithrombin Strand IC Mutants  2423  this was recurrent. The mean age of onset of the first DVT was 19 yr of age.  Protein investigations Assays of antithrombin levels in plasma were performed by antigen and functional methods. Antigen levels of cases 1-6 were measured using Nor Partigen plates (Behringwerke, Marburg, FRG) or a nephelometric method (Nephelometric Analyzer, Behringwerke), while the functional assay employed a heparin cofactor method using either S 2222 (KabiVitrum, Uxbridge, UK), or Dupont reagents and an ACA SX Instrument. Functional and immunological antithrombin levels for case 7 were determined as previously described ( 1 1, 13, 14). CIE was performed with heparin in the first dimension (9, 15), as described ( 12, 16). The polyclonal antibodies were purchased from DakoPatts (High Wycombe, UK) and Behringwerke. Normal pooled plasma was prepared by centrifugation of citrated blood from healthy laboratory staff. Citrated plasma was also prepared from the propositi, all of whom are shown to be heterozygous for variant antithrombins (hereafter termed antithrombins Rosny, Torino, Maisons-Laffitte, Paris 3, La Rochelle, Budapest 5, and Oslo). An-  tithrombin was isolated from normal plasma and from the propositi with antithrombins Rosny and Torino (insufficient plasma was available from the other families) by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden) (16, 17). Plasma (- 30 ml) was applied to the column in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.4 M NaCl: plasma with antithrombin Rosny was subject to a preliminary precipitation step with dextran sulphate. Under the conditions used, approximately half of the antithrombin in each case did not bind to the column and was recovered in the breakthrough fraction containing most of the plasma; when the same quantity of normal plasma was applied to the same column, minimal amounts (barely detectable) of antithrombin did not bind. The breakthrough fractions from the patients' plasmas were separately pooled. The abilities of the two pools to form thrombin-antithrombin complex were studied using an immunoassay (see below). The variant antithrombins were then isolated from these pooled fractions by immuno-affinity chromatography on immobilized polyclonal antibody (DakoPatts) to normal antithrombin ( 18 ). The samples were applied to the column in 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 M NaCl and 0.5% (vol/vol) Tween 80. Elution was achieved with 4.5 M MgCl2 in 0.25 M Tris HCl,  Table I.

Normal antithrombin was also isolated from plasma using this column. For kinetic studies, the antithrombins (normal and variant) were subjected to an additional purification step on ion exchange chromatography, to remove any contaminating heparin from the heparin-Sepharose step (20). The abilities of the variant antithrombins (Rosny and Torino) in pooled breakthrough fractions to form thrombin-antithrombin complex were compared to that of antithrombin in normal plasma using a commercial assay (Enzygnost-TAT; Behringwerke). Samples were diluted to give a final antithrombin concentration (determined by Nor Partigen plates) of 5.38 nM and then incubated at 370C with human a thrombin (a kind gift from Dr. Jean-Marie Freyssinet, Institute d'Hematologie et d'Immunologie, Strasbourg, France), 27.8 nM, in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% (wt/vol) sodium azide, pH 7.8. Complex formation was compared in the absence and presence of 0.015 IU/ml heparin (Leo Laboratories, Princes Risborough, UK). After the addition of thrombin, aliquots (20 ,u) were removed at timed intervals and immediately reacted with 5 Ml of 1,000 U/ml hirudin (kindly supplied by Dr. R. Wallace, Ciba Geigy, Horsham, UK). Before assay, the inhibited reaction mixtures were diluted fivefold in normal plasma.  a  SDS PAGE and immunoblotting were performed under nonreducing conditions using 10-15% Phast Gels (Pharmacia) and rabbit antiantithrombin polyclonal antibody (DakoPatts), as described (21 ). The reaction of purified antithrombin (normal antithrombin and antithrombins Rosny and Torino) with thrombin was studied at 37° C in the absence of heparin. Purified human thrombin (20 nM) was incubated with various concentrations ofantithrombins (see Fig. 5) in 0. 15 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% polyethylene glycol 6,000 (18, 22). At different times, subsamples were withdrawn and added to cuvettes containing the chromogenic substrate S2238 (KabiVitrum) to determine residual thrombin activity. Relative velocity, V/V., where Vo is the initial velocity, of substrate hydrolysis was plotted against time.  DNA amplification and direct sequencing Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of each ofthe subjects investigated. For all cases, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify specifically segments of the antithrombin gene that encode the seven exons and flanking intron sequences. Oligonucleotide primers and thermal cycling conditions have been described previously (23-25).

(26). Single-stranded DNA was directly sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. For each of the seven propositi, the total coding region and the intron-exon boundaries of the antithrombin gene were sequenced.  Restriction endonuclease digestion of the PCR products and haplotype analysis Restriction enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Lewes, UK) and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Digested PCR products were visualized under ultraviolet light, after agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium-bromide staining. Where possible the mutations identified by direct sequencing were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products, DNA from a panel of 50 normal subjects serving as controls. Three polymorphic sites within the antithrombin locus were used to construct haplotypes of the mutant alleles for antithrombins Oslo and Paris 3; a 5'-end length polymorphism (27), a PstI site polymorphism within exon 4 (28), and a DdeI site polymorphism within intron 5 (29).  Allele-specific priming of the PCR  For the single base substitution identified in the antithrombin Rosny gene, allele-specific priming of the PCR was used to confirm the presence of the mutation and to screen the panel of 50 normal individuals. Under appropriate conditions, the mutant allele-specific oligonucleotide (5 '-GAAAGGCCTGTTGGCGTTGC, mutation site underlined), in combination with a normal sequence upstream primer (5'GCTGTGTCTGTGGATGATTTA), resulted in the amplification of a 18 l-bp fragment in the presence of the mutation, but not in its absence. The efficiency of amplification was controlled as previously de-  scribed (24).  Confirmation offamily relationships  The genetic relationships of the antithrombin Torino kindred were investigated by analyzing genomic DNA from family members with a panel of probes known to be specific for hypervariable regions of human DNA (30); these were kindly supplied by Professor Alec Jeffiries, Leicester University, UK. Genomic DNA from the propositus, his sister, and both parents was completely digested with the restriction endonuclease Hinf I (Boehringer Mannheim, Lewes, UK). The DNA was 2426  Lane et al.  Figure 2. Separation of antithrombins Rosny and Torino from plasma by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Plasma from the propositi with these variants were applied to the column in 0.4 M NaCI and eluted with 2.0 M NaCl (see Methods). The top crossed immunoelectrophoretic patterns were obtained from the fraction of (mainly normal) antithrombin that bound to the column in 0.4 M NaCl, while the bottom patterns were obtained from the (variant) fractions that did not bind.  electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose and blotted onto nylon membrane (Hybond N; Amersham Int'l., Amersham, UK). The membrane was prehybridized for 1 h at 650C in 0.5 M sodium phosphate, 7% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2. A panel of human minisatellite probes (MS1, MS2, MS29, MS3 1, MS43, MS5 1, pXG3) was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming and was hybridized to the membrane at 65° C overnight. The membrane was then washed in 2x standard saline citrate (0.3 M NaCl, 30 mM sodium citrate) at 65° C, followed by high stringency washes at the same temperature in 0.1 x standard saline citrate, 0.1% SDS for 15 min each. Autoradiography was performed overnight at -80° C.  Results Antithrombin activity levels were decreased in all cases and, with the exception ofantithrombin Budapest 5, this was accompanied by a reduction in antithrombin antigen levels (Table I). Antigen levels were not, however, reduced in proportion to functional activity levels for six out of seven cases in this series, suggesting the possibility of dysfunctional variant proteins. Plasma samples from all seven families were subjected to CIE with heparin in the first dimension to investigate this possibility (Fig. 1 ). Under conditions where normal plasma produced a characteristic fast moving component and a very much smaller slower moving component, plasmas from the propositi showed reduced normal, fast moving components and increased slower moving fractions. In the case ofplasma samples from affected heterozygotes of the Torino, Paris 3, La Rochelle, Budapest 5, and Oslo kindreds, the slow moving variant peaks (mutant gene products) were clearly of reduced size relative to the fast moving peaks (normal gene products). Relatively reduced concentrations of the variants were not apparent from CIE of antithrombin Rosny and Maisons-Laffitte plasmas, as might have been expected from the antigen assay results in Table I, but it should be noted that this electrophoretic technique is not fully quantitative. For all seven kindreds studied here, the areas under the cathodal variant peaks were substantially greater than that observed for the variant peak from antithrombin Utah, a previously identified substitution mapping to the same region of the antithrombin molecule (31 ). Antithrombins Rosny and Torino were isolated using hepa-  rin-Sepharose chromatography as a preliminary step. Plasma samples were applied in 0.4 M NaCi and the majority of their slow moving components did not bind to the column, Fig. 2. The ability ofthese variant antithrombin fractions to inactivate thrombin was studied using a thrombin-antithrombin complex immunoassay. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the variant antithrombins from both patients did not form thrombin-antithrombin complexes, either in the absence or presence ofhepann. The variants were further purified from the heparin-Sepharose column breakthrough fractions by application to and elution from an anti-antithrombin-Sepharose column.

A normal antithrombin preparation isolated from normal plasma by chromatography on the immobilized anti-antithrombin column served as a control. As can be seen in Fig. 5, while the normal antithrombin was effective in inhibiting thrombin, only minimal inhibitory effects were observed with the variant protein preparations. Sequence analysis of the antithrombin genes for families in this series revealed a variety of single base substitutions in the region of exon 6 corresponding to residues 402-407, Fig. 6.

The antithrombin Rosny allele con-  tained a single base substitution within codon 402 TTC to  TGC, altering the normal Phe to Cys.

It is probable that the mutation in antithrombin Torino was de novo, since the single base substitution was not present in either of the parents of the propositus. Using a panel of DNA probes, each specific for a hypervariable region and with a high heterozygosity, we showed that the genetic relationships have been correctly assigned.

Antithrombins Panis 3 and Oslo had mutations in codon 404 QCC to ACC, Ala to Thr. The antithrombin Oslo gene segregated with the S allele of the 5'-end length polymorphism, the (+) allele for the exon 4 Pstl site polymorphism and the (+) allele for the intron 5 DdeI site polymorphism. The mutant Paris 3 gene differed at the 5 '-end polymorphic site, being linked to the F allele. This analysis shows that the Oslo and Panis 3 mutations, although having the same nucleotide substitution, are linked with different haplotypes, which supports an independent origin of the mutations. Antithrombin La Rochelle had an AAC to AAG mutation resulting in a substitution 405 Asn to Lys, and antithrombin Budapest 5 had a CCT to ACT mutation resulting in a substitution 407 Pro to Thr. This latter nucleotide substitution removes a cleavage site for Stul; restriction analysis of amplified exon 6 DNA with StuI confirmed the presence of a single copy of the mutant allele in the propositus and its absence in the normal subject pool. Sequencing of all seven exons and the intron-exon boundaries in the antithrombin gene identified no other mutations in the seven propositi, except the propositus, with antithrombin La Rochelle was also found to canry the mutation -3 GTG to GAG, Val to Glu. This mutation has been previously described in several kindreds (7, 32) and appears not to be responsible for antithrombin deficiency.  Discussion The affected seven propositi (and their families) investigated in this study presented in a manner that is typical for molecular abnormalities of coagulation inhibitors causing thrombophilia (33), i.e., the propositi have early onset thromboembolic disease and/or there is an association (not always exact) between phenotype (reduced functional antithrombin plasma assay results) and thrombosis within the families. We have shown the presence of seven variant antithrombins that are functionally impaired in the plasmas of these families and have identified their molecular basis as single amino acid substitutions within the primary sequence 402-407. The absence of other significant sequence variations within the mutant antithrombin  on  the  x  to be  (31, 64, 69)  are  involved in clearance (serpin-enzyme  a,-antitrypsin  sequence.  Numbering is given for  ray structure of native ovalbumin  (65).  genes and failure to detect such substitutions in 100 genes from normal healthy individuals, is consistent with the identified mutations being responsible for variant protein production. A notable feature of these mutations is their pleiotropic or multiple effects upon the variant proteins. In this study of the variants we have demonstrated that mutations within or adjacent to antithrombin strand IC can impair both the function of the reactive site and heparin binding, as well as causing a reduction in the plasma level of the protein (in all but one case). The present findings must be considered in the context of previous studies of antithrombin variants. A number of amino acid substitutions in or around the reactive site of antithrombin have been shown to alter its inhibitor function (the fully reported cases are illustrated in Fig. 7 ). Substitution of PI residue 393 Arg by Cys, His, and Pro, and P2 residue 392 Gly by Asp, all completely block the inhibitor-proteinase reaction (20, 34-39). Substitution of P1' residue 394 Ser by Leu (40, 41) drastically impairs the function of the reactive site when thrombin is the target proteinase, but has less effect upon inhibitory function against Factor Xa (42). Substitution of PlO0 and P12 residues, 384 Ala and 382 Ala, respectively (38, 43, 44), causes the inhibitory reaction to be transformed into a substrate reaction in which the reactive bond is completely cleaved by the proteinase (23, 45, 46). Substrate reactions have also been demonstrated for other serpins that have amino acid substitutions or insertions in the P1I2-PlO region (47, 48). Heparin binding to antithrombin is demonstrably altered by some amino acid substitutions. An antithrombin heparin binding site has been proposed on the basis of genetic data ( 18, 49-58), together with information from chemical modification experiments ( 59-6 1) and the properties of the glycosylation isoform, antithrombin-f3 (62, 63). It consists of a surface of high positive charge density around helix D and the NH2-terminal sequence of antithrombin which is not present on other serpins. Some of the variant antithrombins with altered heparim binding properties have amino acid substitutions that directly affect basic amino acids (e.g., 24 Arg, 47 Arg, 129 Arg), while others have those that are thought to alter the conformation of the binding domain (e.g., 41 Pro, 99 Leu). The variant forms of antithrombin considered above have been described as having "simple" phenotypes, characterized by defective thrombin interactions in the presence of normal  Antitlhrombin Strand IC Mutants  2429  2430  Lane et al.  heparin binding, or normal thrombin inhibition in the presence of defective heparin binding. Furthermore, the circulating concentrations ofthe proteins encoded by the normal and variant alleles in the heterozygous patients are usually similar, and the plasma antithrombin antigen concentration is near normal. In contrast, a total of eight different substitution mutants leading to antithrombin deficiency have now been identified in five positions of the 402-407 region (this report; [31, 64] ), see Fig. 7, and these exhibit pleiotropic defects. Fig. 8 shows a sequence alignment for COOH-terminal "activation peptides" of antithrombin, a1-antitrysin, and ovalbumin. In the primary structure of antithrombin, the 402-407 region is located between the P1 residue of the reactive centre and highly conserved regions in strands 4B and 5B of the "activation peptide." The crystal structure of intact ovalbumin (65) can serve as a working prototype for the three dimensional structures of native (reactive loop intact) serpins, Fig. 9. Antithrombin residues 402-407 map to strand IC and the polypeptide leading into strand 4B. The positions of the reactive site, heparin-binding site, and conserved elements of the "activation peptide" are marked in Fig. 9, and the functional consequences of the 402407 mutations will be considered in terms of this model. In vitro studies of purified antithrombins Rosny and Torino (Fig. 5) and antithrombin Utah in plasma (31) revealed defective interactions with thrombin. Based on their presence in patients with clinical thrombosis, it is likely that the other 402-407 region variants also have abnormal interactions with thrombin. The P1 residue of antithrombin, 393 Arg, is the primary determinant of thrombin target specificity and interacts with the enzyme active site. However, because antithrombin inhibits thrombin more efficiently than several other serpins that also have arginine P1 residues (a2-antiplasmin, PAI1, PAI-2, C1 inhibitor, and protein C inhibitor), it can be inferred that an extended inhibitor-enzyme contact surface surrounding the P1 residue participates in the recognition and inhibition of target enzymes by serpins. Inspection of Fig. 9 shows that the 402-407 region is in close proximity to the reactive loop containing the P1 residue, and may constitute part of the extended contact surface or be very close to it. Thus, based on their location near the P1 residue, mutations in the 402-407 region may block antithrombin-protease interactions directly or indirectly. Heparin binding abnormalities have been demonstrated in seven 402-407 region variants by CIE of plasma (Fig. 1). Decreased heparin affinity was confirmed for antithrombins Rosny and Torino by heparin-Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 2 ), but not for antithrombin Utah ( 31 ). Elements of the heparin-binding site are found on the lower face of the mole-  cule shown in Fig. 9. The heparin-binding site is distinct from the reactive site and the region containing 402-407 (upper part of the molecule shown), and spatially removed from them. Therefore, barring overall denaturation ofthe variants, the presence of heparin binding abnormalities in these mutants suggests that the reactive site end of antithrombin (containing the 402-407 region) is linked conformationally to the heparinbinding site at the other side of the molecule. The converse of this idea is the basis of conformation-based hypotheses to explain antithrombin heparin cofactor activity (3, 4). The 402407 substitutions map to strand IC and the polypeptide leading into s4B, and constitute a significant part of the interface between the C sheet at the reactive site pole of the inhibitor, and the internal B sheet which connects at its other end to alpha helices, forming the heparin-binding site of antithrombin (Fig. 9 B). Thus, mutations in the 402-407 region may relay structural changes to the distal heparin binding site by perturbing the B sheet and the core of the molecule. In the extreme, it is possible that inducing perturbations in the core may disrupt protein folding and lead to a phenomenon of general protein denaturation, which would also be associated with a phenotype of defective target enzyme and cofactor interactions and decreased plasma levels. Decreased circulating concentrations of several 402-407 region variants have been detected by CIE (Fig. 1 ) and Western blotting (31) and it had been suggested that integrity of this region is necessary for obtaining normal circulating serpin levels (66, 67). Quantitative deficiencies of antithrombin 402407 variants could be caused by decreased synthesis, increased intracellular degradation, impaired secretion, and/or increased turnover. Two highly conserved elements of the activation peptide map near to 402-407 in the tertiary structure and are thought to play important roles in regulating serpin intracellular degradation and turnover. Brodbeck and Brown noted that COOH-terminal frameshift mutations caused secretory defects in naturally occurring a,-antitrypsin mutants and used an in vitro mutagenesis approach to show that truncations before invariant proline-391 (marked with an asterisk in Fig. 9) are associated with intracellular degradation and prevent movement of the protein from the endoplasmatic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus (68). Thus, intracellular degradation and decreased secretion may occur for some of the antithrombin 402407 variants as a consequence of structural perturbations extending from the immediate vicinity of the substitutions to the region of the invariant proline (residue 391 in a1-antitrypsin). Alternatively, accelerated turnover may be the mechanism responsible for quantitative deficiencies of some 402-407 variants in which structural abnormalities caused by the substitu-  Figure 9. Ovalbumin model (65) for intact serpin structure showing locations of antithrombin 402-407 substitution mutations relative to the reactive loop, the heparin-binding site, and the highly conserved regions of the activation peptide. Several discontinuities present in the polypeptide backbone are caused by low electron density in these portions of the crystal structure. Structural elements of interest are shown in the top view. The reactive loop is on the left and drawn in green. Strand IC and the polypeptide leading into strand 4B are blue. Side chains of the ovalbumin residues corresponding to substituted residues of antithrombin 402 and 403-407 variants are shown in ball and stick rendering. Side chains of invariant and highly conserved residues in strands 4B and 5B (yellow) of the activation peptide are red. The main chain of residue corresponding to invariant glycine 386 (a1-antitrypsin) is also red. The proposed ligand for the serpin-enzyme complex receptor (67) is located in strand 4B and is rendered in cylindrical format. Ovalbumin residues corresponding to antithrombin residues assigned to the heparin-binding site by chemical modification, genetic variant, and glycosylation isoform evidence are orange. The asterisk marks the invariant proline of ovalbumin that corresponds to proline-429 of antithrombin (altered in antithrombin Budapest (22)), and to proline-39 1 of a,-antitrypsin (required for normal secretion in vitro [69]). The bottom view shows structural elements introduced in the top view in the context of the entire molecule. Beta-sheets A, B, and C are drawn in green, yellow, and blue, respectively.  Antithrombin Strand IC Mutants  2431  tions lead to exposure of a highly conserved neoepitope (Fig. 9), proposed to serve as a ligand for hepatic serpin-enzyme complex receptors (67). It is notable that the quantitative deficiency phenotype of a,-antitrypsin Heerlen (69), which carries a leucine for proline substitution at the residue (369) corresponding to antithrombin 407 (see Fig. 8), suggests that this region of serpins is generally involved in determining circulating protein level. In summary, the pleiotropic effects of antithrombin 402407 substitution mutants can be rationalized in terms of a three-dimensional model derived from the crystal structure of native ovalbumin. The strand IC region containing the 402407 mutations is contiguous with the reactive site and two highly conserved elements of the activation peptide that may play important roles in regulating serpin intracellular degradation and plasma clearance; this may explain defective interactions of slC mutants with thrombin, and their low circulating levels. In contrast, slC is distal to the positively charged surface which forms the heparin binding site of heparin; altered heparin-binding properties of the slC variants may therefore reflect conformational linkage between the reactive site and heparinbinding regions of the molecule. Alternatively, integrity of the 402-407 region may be required for antithrombin to fold correctly, and the pleiotropic effects of slC substitutions may represent the consequences of general protein denaturation. Finally, it is interesting that the antithrombin Budapest variant (22) exhibits pleiotropic reactive site and heparin-binding site defects, and carries a substitution (P429L) that maps near the 402-407 region in the tertiary structure (Fig. 9), but not the primary structure.

Mutations at the hexosaminidase A ( H E X A ) gene which cause Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) have elevated frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish and French-Canadian populations. We report a novel TSD allele in the French-Canadian population associated with the infantile form of the disease. The mutation, a G---~A transition at the + 1 position of intron 7, abolishes the donor splice site. Cultured human fibroblasts from a compound heterozygote for this transition (and for a deletion mutation) produce no detectable H E X A m R N A . The intron 7 + 1 mutation occurs in the base adjacent to the site of the adult-onset TSD mutation (G805A). In both mutations a restriction site for the endonuclease E c o R I I is abolished. Unambiguous diagnosis, therefore, requires allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to distinguish between these two mutant alleles. The intron 7 + 1 mutation has been detected in three unrelated families. Obligate heterozygotes for the intron 7 § mutation were born in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region of Quebec. The most recent ancestors c o m m o n to obligate carriers of this mutation were from the Charlevoix region of the province of Quebec. This mutation thus has a different geographic centre of diffusion and is probably less common than the exon 1 deletion TSD mutation in French Canadians. Neither mutation has been detected in France, the ancestral homeland of French Canada.  Introduction Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by massive storage of GMz ganglioside in the neurons of the cerebral Correspondence to: P. Hechtman, Montreal Children's Hospital  Research Institute, McGill University, 2300 Tupper Street, Montreal, Quebec H3H 1P3, Canada  cortex. Mutations causing TSD are alleles at the H E X A gene locus, which encodes the a-subunit of the enzyme hexosaminidase A (Hex A; E.C.3.2.1.52). Mutant H E X A alleles are relatively frequent in two population groups: Ashkenazi Jews and French Canadians. Three mutations, a 4-bp (base pair) insertion in exon 11 (Myerowitz and Costigan 1988), a transition at the intron 12 splice junction (Ohno and Suzuki 1988; Arpaia et al. 1988, Myerowitz 1988), and the GS05A transition associated with adult or chronic GMz gangliosidosis (Navon et al. 1990; Paw et al. 1989) account for over 90% of TSD alleles ( G r e b n e r and Tomczak 1991; Paw et al. 1990; TriggsRaine et al. 1990) in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. A 7.6-kb deletion removing exon 1 and flanking sequence (Myerowitz and Hogikyan 1986, 1987) occurs uniquely among French Canadians and is the most frequent TSD mutation in this population (Hechtman et al. 1990). The center of diffusion for the French-Canadian deletion (FCD) mutation is the Gaspd-Bas St-Laurent region of Quebec, which is on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River (Fig. 1). The carrier frequency for this gene in the two largest cities of this region, Rimouski, Quebec and Edmunston, New Brunswick has been estimated to be 5 % - 7 % ( A n d e r m a n n et al. 1977). Candidate founders for this mutation have been identified among the first generation of French settlers born in Canada (De Braekeleer et al. 1992). We report the characterization of a second novel TSD mutation, which is unique to French Canada. The new mutation is less frequent than the FCD and has a different center of diffusion.  Materials and methods Families  Families D and R have been previously reported. Family D corresponds to families 8 and 9 in (Hechtman et al. 1990) and to family  403  57  75  Lac  St.,lean  C6te de !

The affected children in these families were previously determined to be heterozygous for the FCD and an unknown allele. Family L (Fig. 2) was referred from H6pital de Chicoutimi (Chicoutimi, Quebec) based on clinical diagnosis of Tay-Sachs disease, which was confirmed by the finding of less than 5% Hex A in the proband's serum.  D N A amplification Primer pairs and conditions used to amplify exons of the HEXA gene were as described (Triggs-Raine et al. 1991). For amplifications of DNA for single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, the concentration of dATP in reaction tubes was reduced to 0.1 mM and 10 laCi of c~32pdATP (NEN, Boston, Mass., 3000 Ci/mmol) was added as radioactive tracer.

II  Subcloning and sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products Subclones of mutant PCR products were generated by blunt-end ligation of phosphorylated PCR product into dephosphorylated EcoRV-digested pBS(-) (Stratagene, San Diego, Calif.). Clones were propagated in Escherichia coli DH5c~F'IQ. Cloning procedures were according to Maniatis et al. (1982). Nine subclones  I  2  3  4  5  6  7  Fig. 2.

(Family D after Andermann et al. 1977)  404 were sequenced (four mutant, five normal) for the intron 7 mutation. Sequencing was carried out on individual clones or directly on PCR products using ~35S dATP (subclones) or 321~end-labelect oligonucleotides (direct) with a Sequenase kit.  Direct detection of IVS7 mutation The intron 7 +1, G---~A mutation, as well as the adult-onset TSD mutation (G805A) were detected in an amplified fragment containing exon 7 and flanking sequences by the loss of a restriction site for the enzyme EcoRII. A 10-~tl aliquot of PCR product was digested with 5 units EcoRII and subjected to electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide at 100 V for 5 h. For unambiguous detection of the intron 7 mutation, allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was carried out using 32p end-labeled normal (TGGGGACCAGGTAAGAATG) and mutant (TGGGGACCAGATAAGAATG) probes.  Fig. 3. Sequence of cloned exon 7-intron 7 splice junction region. Upper case exon sequences, lower case intron sequences  Detection of other TSD alleles The detection of the French-Canadian deletion mutation was performed according to Kaplan et al. (1991) and the exon 11 4-bp insertion mutation was detected according to Triggs-Raine and Gravel (1990).  mRNA expression The effect of the mutation on mRNA expression was assessed by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification (Ferre and Garduno 1989) of a (total) RNA-containing fraction prepared from cultured skin fibroblasts of individual R-III-2 as well as from control fibroblasts. HEXA mRNA expression was monitored using total RNA as a template for RT-PCR amplification with primers (sense) TACAACCCTGTCACCCACAT and (antisense) CTGGATGTAGAAGGACTCCA. These primers amplify a 393-bp fragment from normal mRNA starting at nucleotide (nt) 679. The two RNA preparations were normalized for mRNA content by amplification of prolidase (PEPD locus) sequences. Amplification conditions were as in Trop et al. (1992).  Genealogical reconstruction Procedures used for reconstruction of genealogies of obligate heterozygotes, source materials for genealogical data bases, and software used for analysis of pedigrees were essentially the same as reported previously (DeBraekeleer et al. i992).  Frequency of the intron 7 §  allele  Genotypes were ascertained using DNA samples, prepared from peripheral blood leukocytes, which were obtained from 92 individuals living in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean area. Of these individuals, all from the city of Chicoutimi, 50 were randomly ascertained as controls for other studies and the remaining 42, who lived throughout the Saguenay region, were unrelated obligate carriers for the cystic fibrosis gene.  Results  htentification of the mutation P C R amplification of all H E X A exons and flanking sequences followed by SSCP analysis (data not shown) of amplification products p r o d u c e d a pattern of bands that was identical for n o r m a l control D N A and for individual II-2 in the D family (obligate heterozygote) and indi-  vidual III-2 in the R family (affected p r o b a n d ) except for b a n d patterns of exon 7-containing fragments. The sequences of exon 7-containing genomic fragments obtained f r o m individuall III-2 in family R are shown in Fig. 3. The mutation, a G---~A transition at the first position of intron 7, abolishes the universal d o n o r splice site GT.  Effect on gene expression Expression of m u t a n t H E X A m R N A was assessed in cultured skin fibroblasts obtained from R-III-2 since the other m u t a n t H E X A allele in this patient, the F C D ( H e c h t m a n et al. 1990), is not compatible with the expression of H E X A m R N A . No e D N A fragments were detected when an R N A - c o n t a i n i n g fraction from patients' cells was used as a template for R T - P C R , whereas the control cell R N A directed the amplification of a single fragment of 393 bp. Primers for amplification of prolidase ( P E P D gene ) p r o d u c e d c D N A fragments of c o m p a r a b l e intensity when R N A preparations from both normal and T S D cell lines were used as templates, indicating that m R N A p r e p a r e d f r o m patients" cell had not u n d e r g o n e degradation.  Detection of the mutation in genornic DNA The intron 7 +1 mutation occurs in the nucleotide adjacent to the last base in exon 7, which is the site of the adult-onset G S 0 5 A T S D mutation. B o t h mutations result in the loss of a cleavage site for the restriction endonuclease EcoRII. A 221-bp p r o d u c t amplified from norreal genomic D N A gives digestion fragments of 153, 44, 16, and 8 bp. In the m u t a n t allele a 52-bp band replaces the 44-bp fragment (Fig. 4). Digestion of genomic D N A from two clinically affected individuals k n o w n to be heterozygous for the adult T S D m u t a t i o n gives the identical pattern of restriction fragments. T h e two mutations can be unequivocally distinguished using allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization as shown in Fig. 4.

Letters L, D, and R and numerical symbols refer to individuals in pedigrees shown in Fig. 2  of exon 11 sequences in D N A obtained from her father (L-I-3) showed that the exon 11 4-bp insert TSD allele also occurs in this family. This individual is the second such (unrelated) obligate heterozygote we have identified in French Canada (Hechtman et al. 1990).  Origin and regional frequency of the intron 7 4-1 TSD mutation Among 92 unrelated individuals from the Saguenay-LacSt-Jean area one heterozygote was detected using dot hybridization. Genealogical reconstruction performed on the four obligate heterozygotes for the intron 7 + 1 mutation identified 82 common ancestors. Among these, 39 were born in Quebec (14 on C6te de Beaupr6, 13 in Charlevoix, and 12 in Quebec City). None were born in Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean. The remaining 43 common ancestors were born in Europe with 14/43 coming from the French province of Perche. This proportion is considerably higher than the relative contribution of Perche to the total number of settlers of Quebec during the period of the French regime (217/8500) (Charbonneau and Robert 1987).  Discussion A novel H E X A mutation has been identified in a population in which the frequency of Tay-Sachs disease approaches that found among Ashkenazi Jews. In neither population can the spread of TSD alleles be attributed to the effect of a single founder since heteroallelism is found in both groups. The most frequent T S D mutation in French Canada, the 7.6-kb deletion accounts for about 75% of independently segregating alleles (inherited from individuals not more closely related than second degree cousins) and has a center of diffusion on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River. This allele has not been detected among 50 independently segregating TSD chromosomes in France (Akli et la. 1991). By contrast, the exon 11 4-bp insertion mutation has been shown to occur  in two French-speaking North American populations (Hechtman et al. 1990; McDowell et al. 1991) probably introduced by different non-Jewish founders (P. Hechtman, unpublished). The intron 7 + 1 mutant allele is a second instance of a TSD mutation unique to French Canada that also has not yet been detected in France (Akli et al. 1991). It is unlikely that the founder came from France since in seventeenth century rural France whole families did not, as a rule, emigrate to New France and thus carrier sibs who remained in Europe would have passed the gene on to numerous descendants. Such a prediction was born out for the 10-kb deletion hypercholesterolemia mutation (Jomphe et la. 1988; De Braekeleer et al. 1988) and for the MIV allele at the P A H locus (De Braekeleer et al. 1990) both of which are found in Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean and in France. Although a high proportion of ancestors common to the heterozygotes for the intron 7 + 1 TSD allele were from Perche this ancestry is also shared by many individuals from the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region who are unselected for any particular genotype (De Braekeleer et al. 1991). The Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region is a geographic isolate. The birthplaces and dates of the common ancestors correlate with known patterns of settlement in Quebec. Quebec City served as the port of entry for most immigrants in the early years of the French regime. Agricultural settlements moved downriver initially to C6te de Beaupr6 and later to Charlevoix and to Bas St-Laurent. The Charlevoix region was the source of 75% of the emigrants to Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean in the initial phase of white settlement (1838-1870: Gauvreau and Bourque 1988). It is, therefore, most likely that the founder was from the Charlevoix area since (1) no common ancestors came from Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean itself, (2) the most recent common ancestors are all from Charlevoix, and (3) the mutation has not been detected in any other region of Quebec. In the twentieth century industrial development in Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean brought immigrants from other regions of Quebec including the south shore of the St. Lawrence River. Some of these carried the deletion  406 allele a c c o u n t i n g for the o c c u r r e n c e in this region of T a y - S a c h s disease patients w h o are c o m p o u n d h e t e r o z y gotes.

Nucleotide sequence analysis of the HEXB gene coding for the fi subunit revealed two single base substitutions, one in exon2 (A to G, a known polymorphism) and the other in exon 11 (C to T).Analysis of the j3 subunit mRNA species demonstrated activation of a cryptic splice site in exon 11 as well as skipping of the exon.A transfection assay using a chimeric gene containing intron 10 flanked by cDNA sequences carrying themutation confirmed that the singlebase substitution located at position 8 of exon 11 inhibits the selection of the normal 3’ splice site. The results demmutation affecting 3’ splice onstrate a new type of exon site selection.  Sandhoff disease (0-variant GMP gangliosidosis) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations of the @ subunit which result in reduced activities of both Hex A and B (1). As only Hex A canhydrolyze G M z ganglioside in the presence of G M z activator protein (13, 14), Hex A deficiency is responsible for the neuronal storage of G M 2 ganglioside in the central nervous system and peripheral nerves, On the basis of clinical signs and symptoms, as well as the age at onset, three principal clinical phenotypes of Sandhoff disease (infantile, juvenile, and adult forms) have been established. In the infantile form, onset occurs within the first 5 months of age, and the disease is characterized by psychomotor retardation, amaurosis, and macular cherry-red spots, with death by 4 years ofage (1). Recent molecular genetic analysis has revealed a 50-kb deletion (15) and a 16-kb Alutype deletion (16) in the HEXB gene of patients with the infantile form. Neote et al. (16) reported that two patients with the infantile disease were homozygous for the Alu-type @-Hexosaminidase(@-N-acetylhexosaminidase,EC 3.2.1.52, deletion and thatfour other patients were compound heteroHex)’ is a lysosomal hydrolase that cleaves terminal @-N- zygotes with other mutations, allof whom displayed different acetylgalactosamine or @-N-acetylglucosamine moieties of clinical phenotypes.

It occurs in two major forms, Hex A (Mr = 120,000, tations including spinal muscular atrophy, cerebellar ataxia, PI = 4.9), consisting of one a and one p subunit, and Hex B sensory disturbance, and mental retardation (1).In thejuve(Mr= 130,000, PI = 6.9), consisting of two @ subunits.

EXPERIMENTALPROCEDURES  Patient The patient was a 39-year-old Japanese male with a mild clinical presentation of mental retardationand local panatrophy. The parents were first cousins. Hex A activity of the patient’s leukocytes and fibroblasts were decreased to 6 and 8% of control, respectively. Hex B activity was undetectable. Rectal biopsy demonstrated membranous cytoplasmic bodies in neurons of Meissner’s plexus. Urinary excretion of large amount of neutral oligosaccharides was demonstrated, which were consistent with the storage of the substrates due to the Hex A and B deficiencies. Materials  COS cells usedfor the transient expression study were kindly provided by Dr. E. I. Ginns at the National Institute of Mental Health.

T4 DNA ligase, T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase, Ampli Taq", and restriction enzymes were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto, Japan. Human pcDHexa (10) and human pcDHex0 (8) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Human genomic p actin DNA was kindly provided by Dr. T. Hamada, University of Tokyo. Synthesis of Oligonucleotides Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) or provided by Dr. R. A. Gravel, Montreal Children's Hospital, Montreal, Canada. Northern Blot Analysis Total RNAwas extracted from cultured skin fibroblasts (21). Poly(A)+ RNA (5 pg) prepared by oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography was electrophoresed through a 1.2% formaldehyde/agarose gel and was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The filter was hybridized with a 32P-labeledHex fl subunit cDNA probe (22). After the hybridization, the filter was washed to a final stringency of 0.1 X SSC, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 60 "C for 20 minutes (1X SSC = 150 mM NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0). Autoradiography was done using an intensifying screen. The same filter was used for rehybridization with "P-labeled Hex a subunit cDNA or (3 actin genomic DNA. Southern Blot Analysis PCR products were electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose gel and were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After hybridization with 32P-labeled Hex 0 subunit cDNA (22), the filters were washed to a final stringency of 0.1 X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 "C for 10 min and autoradiographed. Amplification of HEXB Genomic DNA We identified unique sequences in the HEXB gene (11) for the selection of oligonucleotide primers after a computer search of the GenBank data base to avoid sequences homologous to other genes. One of each oligonucleotide pair was constructed with an EcoRI or a HindIII linker sequence at the 5' end (Table IA). One microgram of a control or the patient's genomic DNA wassubjected to 30 cycles of  2407  PCR consisting of denaturation at 94 "C for 1min, annealing at 53 "C for 1 min, and primer extension at 72 "C for 3 min (23). Analysis of mRNA Species by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of 10 pgof total RNA from normal or the patient's fibroblasts with 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and 10 pmol of specific antisense primers (Table IB)in a reaction volume of 20 gl (24). The cDNA product was subjected to 30 cycles of PCR consisting of denaturation at 94 "C for 30 s, annealing at 55 "C for 30 s, and extension at 72 "C for 1 min. Four pairs of oligonucleotides were designed to cover the entire subunit mRNA with overlapping regions (Table IB). Nucleotide Sequence Analysis PCR products were subcloned into a plasmid vector, pUC19, and more than 5 clones were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain terminator method using double-stranded DNA as templates (25). MspZ Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism of the Family Members and Normal Controls One microgram of genomic DNA from family members or normal controls was amplified using the specific primers, exon10: 5'GGTTTTGGATATTATTGCAACCATAAA-3' and exon 11: 5'GGAGCAGAAAGGATTACAGGGAAGCCA-3'. The PCR products were digested with MspI, andthe digested and undigested PCR products were electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose gel.

The PCR product was digested with HindIII and inserted into the HindIII cleaved pKSHexP1 (=pKSHexb2). Next, the AflII-Bsu36I fragment of pcDHex8 was replaced with the AflII and Bsu36I fragment of pKSHexa2. The resultantconstruct, pcDHexBM8, contained the exon 11 mutation but was otherwise identical with pcDHexB. Step 2: Introduction of Exon 2 Mutation-A PCR product carrying the exon 2 mutationwas generated by PCR amplification of pcDHex8 using the following primers, of which one primer contained the mutant sequence (exon 2: 5'-GCTGAATTCCAGGCTAGAACCCA3' (mutation underlined); exon 8 5"ATCTCCTCCCAAATGAAT3'). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and inserted into EcoRI-cleaved pcDHexaM8.

Amplification was carried out for 20 cycles: each cycle consisted of a 30-s denaturation at 94 "C, 30-s annealing at 58 "C, and a 1-min extension at 72 "C. A 3-pl aliquot from each PCR product was analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 1 X TBE (0.089 M Tris-borate, 0.089 M boric acid, and 0.002 M EDTA). The gel was dried under vacuum at 80 "C and exposed to Kodak XAR-film with an intensifying screen. Each band was measured by laser densitometry (LKB, Ultrascan XL). Analysis of mRNA Species in COS Cells Transfected with Chimeric Genes  Total RNA was extracted from COS cells 58 h after transfection with 3, 10, or 20 pg of control or mutant chimeric genes. The first strand Hex 8 subunit cDNA wassynthesized by reverse transcription of Hex 8 subunit mRNA with a specific primer (Table IB, IV, antisense primer).

The sequence of 450 base pairs of the HEXB promoter region includingputative GCboxes, CAAT box, and AP-1-like binding sequences, as well as all splice junctions and the 3’ noncoding region including the polyadenylation signal, were identical with those of control. Among the exon sequences, however, two single base substitutions were identified. One, a C to T transition substitutingleucine forproline 417 (CCG to CTG,Fig. 3A), was found in exon11.The other, an A to G transition substituting arginine for lysine 121 (AAA to AGA, Fig. 3 B ) was found in exon 2. The latter has been shown to be polymorphic among normal populations and is presumed not tobe associated with thedisease.2 The Candidate for the Disease Mutation, the Pro to Leu Change, Abolishes a MspI Site-We therefore established a diagnostic testfor the mutationby examining MspI restriction products after PCR amplification of surrounding sequences. The parents and the sister were shown to be heterozygous, and the patient was homozygous‘for the mutation (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the allele was not found in any of 36 normal unrelated individuals (data not shown). The Mutant Hex /3 Subunit cDNA Encodes Active Hex (? Subunits, and Hex Deficiency Is Due to the Decreased Steady State Leuel of Hex p Subunit mRNA-To establish whether the mutations we identified affect Hex p subunit activity, we introduced thetwo mutations into the pcDHexP cDNA, which contains thefull length human Hexp subunit cDNA(7).

The mutantcDNA construct, pcDHex@(Lys”’+Arg, Pro4’’ Leu), carries the two single base substitutions,but is otherwise identical with the original pcDHexp. Transient expression of the pcDHexp(LysI2’ 4 Arg, Pro4’: + Leu) in COS cells gave increased Hex activitycomparable to that seenin COS cells transfected withpcDHexp, the normal human Hex /3 subunit cDNA (Fig. 5). Identification of Aberrant Splicing of Hex P Subunit mRNA-The results described above suggested that the dramatically decreased steady state level of the Hex @ subunit mRNA in the patient’s cells is the primary cause for the decreased Hex A and B activities, because the mutant Hex p subunit carrying Pro4’‘+ Leu and Lys”)‘ + Arg is as active as the wild type Hex /3 subunit. Since we did not detect any mutations in the promoter region of the HEXB gene, we surmised that thereduction in steady statemRNA was likely due to instability of the mRNA. As nonfunctional mRNA is the most frequent cause of such instability, we analyzed the  2410  Splicing Error  Caused by Exon Mutation Sandhoff in  Disease  Hex /3 subunit mRNA by RT-PCR to examine its integrity.

With primer pairIV (Table IB), abnormal " DNA fragments (P2 and P3Fig. in 6, B and C)were identified exonl' in the patient in addition to the normal PCR product(P1 in Fig. 6, B and C). Southern blot analysis using the Hex p subunit cDNA as the probe demonstrated that the two aberonll normal PCR products (P2 and P3) hybridized to the Hex /3 subunit cDNA. The PCR products (Pl, P2, and P3) were subcloned into a plasmid vector, pUC19, and theirnucleotide sequences were determined. The results of the sequence analysis revealed that P1 corresponded to normally spliced Hex p B subunit mRNA. However, P2 appeared to be generated by abnormal splicing in exon 11, and P3was produced by skipping exon 11 (Fig. 7, A and B). In P2 and P3, early termination codons (TGA) appear 6 nt and 171 nt after the abnormal 63bp splice junction, respectively (Fig. 7B).

However, the three transcripts were detected in fibroblasts from results described above demonstrated aberrant splicings in the Sandhoff patient at an estimated ratio of P1:P2:P3 = exon 11. As the nucleotidesequence of intron 10 of the 11:2:1 with overall levels in the patientsignificantly reduced patient's Hex p subunit gene is identical with that of control (data not shown), theC to T transition at position 8 seemed most likely to be responsible for the inappropriate 3' splice site selection.

First, the major aberrant species, P2, was found in reduced levels (0.6%) in normal cells. Secondly, the transfection of COS cells with normal cDNA containing intron 10 produced normal (Pl) and abnormal (P2) transcripts showing that P2 canbe a significantly selected product inthis cell type. Thus, our results point to a shift in the ratio of the three identified species: normal P1 (>99%): P2 (0.6%): P3 (undetected) compared to mutantP1 (11):P2 (2): P3 (l),with the overall levels in the latter case significantly reduced (8% of control, Fig. 8C). In fact, with the likelihood that P2 and P3 areinherently unstable species, the actual ratio of synthesis may favor higher levels of P2 and possibly P3 in normal cells and the majority of synthesis of these species in mutant cells. Thus, we propose that the mutation, eight nucleotides into the exon adjacent to the splicing acceptor site, inhibits the recognition of the normal splice position, therebyallowing an increase in species normally present in very low or undetectable levels. The most frequentcause of aberrant splicing of the 3‘ splice siteis deletions or mutations (31-46) affecting the splice acceptor consensus sequence, NCAG/G (49, 50). Also, single base mutations within introns have been reported to create new acceptor splice sites (17, 18, 47, 48). None of these mechanisms can explainthe aberrantsplicing observed in the present case. Recent in vitro studies of pre-mRNA splicing in higher eukaryotes have demonstrated that splicing of individual introns takes place in two steps after assembly of the premRNA into the large multicomponent complex, termeda spliceosome, which is comprised of multiple small ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particles (reviewed in Refs. 51 and 52). Although factors including U2 snRNP (53-55), U5 snRNP (56), hnRNP C protein (57), 70-kDa intron binding protein (58, 59), U2AF (60), several hnRNP proteins (61), and P62 (62), have been shown to associate with sequences upstream of the 3’ splice site or to the3’ consensus AG sequence, there is no evidence for factor bindingto exon sequence downstream of the selected splice site. Our results suggest a role for adjacent 3’ sequences, whether they might participate through factorbinding or in the secondary structure of the RNA molecule in its association with the spliceosome. There areprecedents for exon mutation disrupting normal splicing. For example, it hasbeen shown that exon mutations involving insertions or deletions affect the splicing of SV 40 mRNAs (63). Reed and Maniatis (64) showed that usage of the adjacent splice site is decreased when a normal human exon sequence was replaced by a highly homologous mouse exon. Furdon and Kole (65) showed that efficiency of splicing of human @-globinpre-mRNA depends on the length of the second exon, and insertion of a fragment of @-globinintron 2 within exon 2 was shown to poison splicing. In the human fibronectin gene, a deletion of 81 nucleotides of the EDIIIA exon was shown to eliminate alternate splicing (66). Similar deletion studies showed that a 3’ exon sequence is essential for splicing of the bovine growth hormone pre-mRNA (67) and avianretrovirus RNA (68). Moreover, these deletion studies showed a significant decrease in the level of spliceosome assembly (68). Very recently, a single A/G nucleotide polymorphism in exon 2 of the episialin gene, eight nucleotides downstream of the second splice acceptor site, was shown to affect 3’ splice site selection (69), a finding quite similarto the presentcase. They proposed the interesting hypothesis that the A to G substitution results in the formation of an altered secondary structure of the pre-mRNA, which makes the splice acceptor  in Sandhoff Disease  site inaccessible to the splicing machinery. Previous studies have also suggested that the structure of stable hairpins of pre-mRNA can influence splice site selection (70-76). In the present case, there is a possibility that the exon 11 mutation affects the secondary structure of Hex @ subunit pre-mRNA. The present study has reinforced the importance of exon sequences in the splicing reaction and provides interesting insight into 3‘ splice site selection, whose detailed mechanism remains to be elucidated.

Nucleotide sequence analysis of the HEXB gene coding for the beta subunit revealed two single base substitutions, one in exon 2 (A to G, a known polymorphism) and the other in exon 11 (C to T). Analysis of the beta subunit mRNA species demonstrated activation of a cryptic splice site in exon 11 as well as skipping of the exon. A transfection assay using a chimeric gene containing intron 10 flanked by cDNA sequences carrying the mutation confirmed that the single base substitution located at position 8 of exon 11 inhibits the selection of the normal 3' splice site. The results demonstrate a new type of exon mutation affecting 3' splice site selection."

Different mutations in the beta cardiac myosin heavy-chain gene have been identified in three affected families. However, neither the proportion of cases attributable to myosin mutations nor the effects of different mutations on clinical outcome are known. METHODS Using a ribonuclease protection assay, we screened the beta cardiac myosin heavy-chain genes of probands from 25 unrelated families with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; this assay is a sensitive method for detecting the presence and location of mutations. We further defined the mutations by analyzing their nucleotide sequences. The clinical features of the disease were compared in families with various myosin mutations. RESULTS Seven mutations in the beta cardiac myosin heavy-chain gene were identified in 12 of the 25 families. All were missense mutations (i.e., causing the substitution of a single amino acid) clustered in the head and head-rod junction regions of the molecule. Six mutations resulted in a change in the charge of the amino acid. Patients with mutations that changed the charge of the altered amino acid (such as that from arginine to glutamine at nucleotide 403 or from arginine to cysteine at nucleotide 453) had a significantly shorter life expectancy (mean age at death, 33 years), whereas patients with the one mutation that did not produce a change in charge (Val606Met) had nearly normal survival. However, patients with different mutations did not differ appreciably in their clinical manifestations of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS Different missense mutations in the beta cardiac myosin heavy-chain gene can be identified in approximately 50 percent of families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In those families, a definite genetic diagnosis can be made in all members. Since the location of a mutation or its DNA-sequence alteration (or both) appears to influence survival, we suggest that the precise definition of the disease-causing mutation can provide important prognostic information about affected members.

In this report, we address the possibility that some sporadic sarcomas may be associated with new germline mutations of the p53 gene, which would not be manifested as familial cancer unless the patient survived to reproduce. METHODS We studied DNA from peripheral leukocytes of 196 patients with sarcoma and from 200 controls. Of the 196 patients with sarcoma, 15 were selected because they had had multiple primary cancers or had a family history of cancer. The entire coding sequence and splice junctions of the p53 gene were analyzed for mutations. RESULTS Eight germline mutations were found, three in patients with no known family history of cancer and five in patients with an unusual personal or family history of cancer. Four mutations caused amino acid substitutions, and four caused stop codons. These mutations were not present in any of the 200 controls. CONCLUSIONS New germline mutations of the p53 gene are rare among patients with "sporadic" sarcoma but may be common in patients with sarcoma whose background includes either multiple primary cancers or a family history of cancer. Diverse mutations of this gene were associated with an increased likelihood of cancer; hence, the entire gene should be considered a target for heritable mutation. It appears that the group of patients with cancer who carry germline mutations of the p53 gene is more diverse than is suggested by the clinical definition of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The identification of carriers could be of substantial clinical importance. "

Inherited mutations (transmitted through the germline) of this gene can underlie the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare familial association of breast cancer in young women, childhood sarcomas, and other malignant neoplasms. We investigated the possibility that p53 mutations in the germline are associated with second primary cancers that arise in children and young adults who would not be considered as belonging to Li-Fraumeni families. METHODS Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood leukocytes of 59 children and young adults with a second primary cancer. The polymerase chain reaction, in combination with denaturant-gel electrophoresis and sequencing, was used to identify p53 gene mutations. RESULTS Mutations of p53 that changed the predicted amino acid sequence were identified in leukocyte DNA from 4 of the 59 patients (6.8 percent). In three cases, the mutations were identical to ones previously found in the p53 gene. The fourth mutation was the first germline mutation to be identified in exon 9, at codon 325. Analysis of leukocyte DNA from close relatives of three of the patients indicated that the mutations were inherited, but cancer had developed in only one parent at the start of the study. CONCLUSIONS These findings identify an important subgroup of young patients with cancer who carry germline mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene but whose family histories are not indicative of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The early detection of such mutations would be useful not only in treating these patients, but also in identifying family members who may be at high risk for the development of tumors. "

Since p21m.GTP is a major regulator of growth and differentiation, mutant neurofibromins resulting from somatic mutations in the NF1 gene might interfere with ras signaling pathways and contribute to the development of tumors. We describe an amino acid substitution in the NFl GRD, altering Lys-1423, that has occurred in three tumor types: colon adenocarcinoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and anaplastic astrocytome, and in one family with neurofibromatosis 1. The GAP activity of the mutant NFl GRD is 200- to 400-fold lower than that of wild type, whereas binding affinity is unaffected. Thus, germline mutations in NF7 that cause neuroflbromatosis 1 can also occur in somatic cells and contribute to the development of sporadic tumors, including tumors not associated with neurofibromatosis 1. Introduction Guanine nucleotide binding to ras proteins mediates signal transduction that regulates cell growth: binding to GTP activates signaling, while hydrolysis to GDP terminates signaling (Barbacid, 1987). A GTPase-activating protein (GAP) was the first protein found to catalyze the hydrolysis to GDP and thereby mediate the signal termination event (Trahey and McCormick, 1987). In addition to this role, it  1 Gene  has been proposed that GAP may alS0 fUnCtiOn in Signal propagation as a downstream effector of ras (McCormick, 1989; Hall, 1990). More recently, the GAP-related domain (GRD) of neurofibromin, the neurofibromatosis 1 (AW) gene product, was also found to stimulate the GTPase of ras (Ballester et al., 1990; Martin et al., 1990; Xu et al., 1990b) and to possess properties consistent with the functioning of neurofibromin as a downstream effector of ras (Bollag and McCormick, 1991). Since somatic mutations that activate fas genes may contribute to tumorigenesis in up to 30% of human tumors (Bos, 1989), we reasoned that somatic mutations in the NFl gene that affect the ras signaling pathway may also occur in some of these tumor types, as well as in tumors associated with neurofibromatosis 1. Therefore, we chose to search sporadic tumors from non-NFl individuals as well as the constitutional DNA of NFl patients for mutations in the NFl GRD. Here we describe mutations found in tumors and in a family with neurofibromatosis 1. Results Detection of Mutations in the NFl GRD in Tumors The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method (Orita et al., 1989) was used to screen rapidly for mutations in the GRD of the NF7 gene (NFl GRD) in samples of DNA extracted from tumors. The first exon screened is 159 bp in length and corresponds to codons 1371-l 423 of the open reading frame of the full-length NF7 cDNA (Marchuk et al., 1991). Located in the middle of the NFl GRD, the protein segment encoded by this exon shows approximately 30% homology to the corresponding segments of the human GAP and yeast IRA1 and IRA2 proteins (Xu et al., 1990a). A stretch of three consecutive amino acids, FLR, near the middle of the exon is completely conserved across all four proteins; FLR occurs only once in the entire 2818 aa sequence of the predicted NFl protein. For convenience, we refer to this exon as the FLR exon. This exon received high priority in our screening strategy, because the relatively high degree of conservation of amino acid sequence across these different proteins and between species suggested that somatic mutations in this region of the gene would be likely to alter amino acid residues crucial to the function of the protein, and so result in clinical pathology. A pair of intron-based primers (see Experimental Procedures) was used to generate a 236 bp PCR product containing the FLR exon. In most cases, paired samples of tumor DNA and accompanying constitutional DNA from the same individuals were analyzed. The DNA samples were from 22 colon adenocarcinomas paired with either peripheral blood lymphocytes or normal colon tissue; 28 peripheral blood samples from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (a preleukemia condition) for which no constitutional DNA was available; and 10 anaplastic astro-  Cell 276  cytoma/peripheral blood lymphocyte pairs. (Astrocytoma is one of the most common malignant brain tumors.) No tumor samples were from NFl patients. One of each tumor type showed a variant band on SSCP gels. Figure 1 shows the SSCP patterns for the tumor and constitutional DNA from the one remarkable colon cancer sample and the one remarkable anaplastic astrocytoma sample. DNA sequencing (Figure 1) showed that both variant bands were due to a single base change affecting the first nucleotide position of the Lys codon (AAG) at position 1423 in the amino acid sequence. This Lys is one of 14 aa residues in the catalytic domain that are absolutely conserved across all members of the GAP family of proteins (proteins encoded in yeast by the IRAI, IRA2, and Sad genes and in mammals by the GAP and NF7 genes) (Xu et al., 1990a; Wang et al., 1991), suggesting that it has a crucial function in NFl GRD activity. An A to G transition in the colon cancer causes a Lys to Glu amino acid substitution. However, an A to C transversion in the anaplastic astrocytoma results in a Lys to Gln amino acid substitution. All SSCP bands derived from the constitutional DNA samples accompanying these two tumors were also sequenced, revealing only the normal AAG codon. The sequences of the tumor variant bands and the constitutional DNA bands were otherwise identical. Normal tissue DNA to accompany the one myelodysplastic syndrome sample  . Figure 1.

However, sequencing of the variant band from this myelodysplastic syndrome sample revealed the same GAG variant codon shown above to have occurred as a somatic mutation in the colon cancer sample. Detection of the Lys to Glu Mutation in a Patient with Neuroflbromatosis 1 To detect sensitively and rapidly any change in the first nucleotide of the Lys-1423 codon in the constitutional DNA of NFl patients, we designed a restriction enzyme digestion-based assay that uses PCR to introduce the recognition sequence of the enzyme in an allele-specific manner (Pettyetal., 1991). Inthisassaythepresenceofthenormal adenine nucleotide at the first base of the codon allows cutting, but the appearance of any other nucleotide destroys the recognition site of the restriction enzyme. A PCR primer based on the sequence immediately preceding the AAG lysine codon was used in combination with a downstream intron-based primer to amplify a short DNA segment containing the AAG lysine codon (see Experimental Procedures). By designing the upstream primer to have a nontemplate G nucleotide at its 3’terminus, we cause the PCR product derived from normal NFl sequence to contain the sequence TCGA, in which the G comes from the last base in the upstream primer and the A comes from the first nucleotide position of the AAG lysine codon. Since TCGA is the recognition site for Taql restriction endonuclease, the PCR product from the normal NFl sequence will be cut by Taql. Any mutation altering the first A in the AAG Lys-1423 codon prevents cutting by Taql. Lymphoblast DNA samples from 80 NFl patients were screened by this assay, along with the mutant anaplastic astrocytoma sample and its accompanying normal lymphocyte DNA. The PCR products from 79 of the 80 NFl patients and from the lymphocyte DNA of the anaplastic astrocytoma patient cut completely with Taql, whereas approximately one-half of the PCR product from the anaplastic astrocytoma DNA sample did not cut with the restriction enzyme, as expected from our sequencing data for this tumor DNA sample. However, NFl patient 11404 appeared to be heterozygous at the first nucleotide position of the AAG codon, since only half of the PCR product showed cutting with Taql (Figure 2, sample 1). To determine what sequence change was responsible for this result, the entire FLR exon was PCR amplified from the genomic DNA of patient 11404, cloned into the pBluescript II phagemid vector, and sequenced manually. Sequencing of ten independent clones revealed that five contained the normal Lys-1423 codon, AAG; however, the remaining five clones contained the unusual codon Glu1423 GAG that had been found in the colon cancer DNA sample.

All NFl-affected descendants of patient 11404, like patient 11404 herself, were heterozygous by this assay. The one unaffected granddaughter was homozygous for the normal A nucleotide. The three NFl-affected granddaughters had to inherit the Taql-resistant allele from their NFl-affected father, because their unaffected mother is homozygous for the Taql-sensitive allele. This study shows that the Glu-1423 mutation perfectly coinherits with neurofibromatosis 1 in this family and therefore must lie in the same copy of the NFl gene that bears the neurofibromatosis-causing mutation. This is the expected result if the Glu-1423 mutation itself is the cause of neurofibromatosis 1 in this family. Construction, Expression, and Biochemical Analysis of NFl GRD Mutant Proteins To examine the functional consequences of these mutations, site-directed mutagenesis by PCR was performed to generate the A to C and A to G mutant fragments of NFl cDNA encoding the GAP-related domain (NFl GRD). DNA sequencing confirmed that only the desired bases were mutated. Mutant NFl fragments with an appended sequence encoding the KT3 epitope (TPPPEPET) were cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcC4, and the two mutant NFl GRD proteins were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified using KT3 beads as previously described (Martin et al., 1990). The ras GTPase-stimulating activities of the mutant and wild-type NFl GRDs were determined by measuring phosphate release (Martin et al., 1990). Figure 3 shows that the activities of both mutant proteins are greatly reduced compared with that of wild-type NFl GRD. The activities of the Lys to Gln and Lys to Glu mutants were reduced by approximately 400- and 200-fold, respectively. ~21 N-ra8was  2'0  4‘0  6b  (NFt -GRD], Figure 3.

The concentration of inhibitor at which GTP hydrolysis is inhibited by 50% is approximately equal for the mutant and the wild-type NFl GRD proteins, indicating that all bind with about the same affinity.

We started with different concentrations of the Lys to Glu mutant protein and the wild-type NFl GRD to achieve a similar GAP activity; therefore, the mutant protein was approximately 509fold more concentrated than the wild-type peptide.  Cell 270  Somatically acquired point mutations affecting codon 14230f the NFl gene have been found in DNAfrom acolon adenocarcinoma and an anaplastic astrocytoma. One of these mutations was also detected in a myelodysplasia for which no constitutional DNA control was available. The mutations alter a Lys residue in the catalytic domain of neurofibromin that is invariant among GAP-related proteins (Xu et al., 1990a; Wang et al., 1991) and is therefore likely to be crucial for normal functioning. Indeed, the mutant NFl GRD proteins bind with normal affinity to ras.GTP but are severely impaired in stimulating the ras GTPase. Somatic mutations in tumors were not randomly distributed within the NF1 gene: within this 159 bp exon, screened in 60 tumors, mutations were detected only in codon 1423. A mutation in this same codon was also found in a family with NFl, where it coinherits with the disease. These results suggest that at least some of the mutations in the NF7 gene that occur in the germline to cause neurofibromatosis 1 can also occur in somatic cells and contribute to the development of sporadic tumors. One might expect that any tumor type found occasionally to harbor somatic mutations in the NFI gene would be a tumor type with an increased incidence among NFl patients. Indeed, astrocytomas have been reported to occur at higher rates in NFl patients (Blatt et al., 1966; Serensen et al., 1966; Cohen and Rothner, 1969; Kibirige et al., 1969). However, colon cancers and myelodysplasias do not seem to have an increased incidence among NFl patients. Furthermore, three generations of NFlaffected individuals in the family of patient 11404 had no history of either of these tumor types, even though the Glu-1423 mutation found in the colon and myelodysplasia tumors must be present in every somatic cell of these individuals. There is a precedent for this apparent paradox among the hereditary neoplastic syndromes. Somatic mutations in the retinoblastoma gene are found frequently in sporadic small cell lung cancers, yet this tumor type does not have an increased incidence among individuals with hereditary retinoblastoma (Harbour et al., 1966; Yokota et al., 1968). Thus, somatic mutations in the Rb gene in lung cells may contribute to, and may even be necessary for, the development of the tumors; however, the mutations are not rate limiting for tumorigenesis in this cell type. These considerations suggest that NF7 mutations might promote growth in NFl-associated tumor types by one mechanism and promote growth in other tumor types by a somewhat different mechanism. Possible roles for neurofibromin as either an upstream regulator or a downstream effector of ras.GTP have been presented (Xu et al., 1990a), but these roles are not incompatible: neurofibromin may serve both functions. In cell types where ras.GTP is growth promoting, e.g., in colon cancers (80s et al., 1987) and myelodysplasias (Liu et al., 1987; Lyons et al., 1988; Padua et al., 1988), the diminished capacity of mutant neurofibromins to stimulate GTP hydrolysis on ras may allow enhanced ras.GTP signaling, causing growth. In cell types where ras.GTP appears to be growth  inhibiting, e.g., in Schwann cells (Ridley et al., 1988) and pheochromocytomas (Bar-Sagi and Feramisco, 1985; Noda et al., 1985) mutant neurofibromin may disrupt a ras.GTP-neurofibromin complex that is required for transduction of the growth-inhibiting signal. This would then shift the balance of growth-regulating signals toward growth. The latter mechanism may be involved in neurofibromatosis 1, since Schwann cells proliferate excessively in the development of neurofibromas (Riccardi and Eichner, 1986) and pheochromocytomas have an increased incidence among NFl patients (Riccardi and Eichner, 1986; Cohen and Rothner, 1989). Furthermore, a careful screen for activating mutations in ras genes in human pheochromocytomas revealed none (Moley et al., 1991)-the expected result if ras.GTP inhibits growth in this cell type. According to the above scheme the Glu-1423 NF7 mutation would be expected to disrupt both of the proposed functions of neurofibromin (ras regulator and ras effector) in order to contribute to the development of colon and myelodysplasia tumors and cause neurofibromatosis 1; i.e., the mutant neurofibromin should be functionally null. In addition to its diminished ability to stimulate the ras GTPase, demonstrated here, it should be blocked in signal transduction. Alternatively, the levels of the mutant neurofibromin in the cell could be very low if the mutation makes the protein unstable. Many of the NF7 mutations that have already been found in NFl patients are also expected to be nulls, because they involve translocations, mediumsized to large deletions, or stop codons occurring within protein-coding regions of the gene (Viskochil et al., 1990; Cawthon et al., 1990). The view presented here of neurofibromin as both ras regulator and ras effector would allow the protein to function somewhat differently in different tissues. Thus, overlapping but distinct classes of mutant NFl alleles may yet prove to be involved in the development of different tumor types. How broad a role do somatic mutations at the NF7 locus play in tumorigenesis? Three out of sixty tumors revealed functionally important missense mutations affecting a single normally invariant residue of the highly conserved FLR exon. However, it is difficult to estimate the overall frequency of involvement of NF 7 in such tumors, as the mutations reported here were detected in the first NF1 exon screened, leaving 49 protein-encoding exons yet to be scanned. Therefore, the true incidence of somatic mutations in the NFI gene in colon adenocarcinomas, myelodysplasias, and anaplastic astrocytomas may be quite high. In light of the mutations reported here, a possible role for NF7 mutations should be considered in any tumor type in which activatedrasgenesarefrequentlyfound. Perhaps in these tumortypes NF7 mutations are the functional complement of ras mutations and will be found in those tumor samples lacking ras mutations. Since in neurofibromatosis 1 tumor incidence is elevated in at least some tissues where ras.GTP is growth inhibiting (see above), a role for NF7 mutations must also be considered in any tumor type in which activated ras can be shown to inhibit growth (e.g., medullary thyroid carcinoma; Nakagawa et al., 1987; Nelkin et al., 1990). Perhaps in these tumor types NF7 muta-  Somatic 279  Mutations  in NFI  in Human  Tumors  tions will be found in those tumor samples composed of cells that continue to proliferate when activated ras is introduced.  the dideoxy sequencing reactions with Taq polymerase in a thermal cycler, using fluorescently tagged Ml3 universal or reverse sequencing primers, followed by gel electrophoresis and data collection and analysis on an Applied Biosystems model 373A automated sequencer.  Experimental  Taql Restriction Endonuclease Screening of the First Nucleotide in the Lys-1423 Codon In this assay when genomic DNA is used as the template for PCR with the FLRTAQ and rFLRlN primers, amplification occurs from both the NF 1 locus on chromosome 17 and the NFI pseudogene locus on chromosome 15 (Y. L. et al., unpublished data); this happens because the nucleotide sequence identity in these two homologous segments is greater than 90%, and neither of the primers used for PCR in this amplification is locus specific. To make the assay specific to the NF1 locus on chromosome 17, we first amplify the entire FLR exon with the intron-based primers FLRIN and rFLRlN (as above, but without the radioactive nucleotide). This PCR amplifies only from the NFI locus on chromosome 17 (unpublished data), because FLRIN cannot prime in the pseudogene. We then dilute this NFI locus-specific PCR product IOOO-fold and perform a second PCR using the FLRTAQ and rFLRlN primers to obtain the final product that is tested in the Taql restriction endonuclease digestion assay.

Half the PCR volume was transferred to a second microtiter plate, under a drop of mineral oil. Eight units of Taql restriction endonuclease in a 4 ul volume was then added to each sample, and the plate was incubated at 65“C for 2 hr. Samples were then subjected to electrophoresis through a 6% agarose gel (3:1, Nusieve:SeaPlaque agarose), stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed over an ultraviolet light.  Procedures  Patient Tissues DNA was extracted from normal and tumor tissues of colon cancer patients, starting from either frozen (Ausubel et al., 1991) or paraffinembedded specimens (Wright and Manos, 1990).

DNA samples from the peripheral blood of myelodysplastic syndrome patients were donated by Dr. Eitan Friedman. NFI patients participating in this study are those described (Cawthon et al., 1990). The protocols for obtaining human tissue samples used in this project have been approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center. The colon cancer DNA sample with the Lys to Glu mutation was from a moderately differentiated colon adenocarcinoma from an 83-year-old female. The myelodysplasia DNA sample with the Lys to Glu mutation was from a peripheral blood specimen diagnosed as refractory anemia with excess of blasts. This DNA was screened for N-ras and K-ras mutations at codons 12,13, and 61 by an allele-specificoligonucleotide hybridization assay, and no mutations were detected. The patient was a 56year-old woman who subsequently developed acute myelogenous leukemia. The anaplastic astrocytoma DNA sample with the Lys to Gln mutation was from tumor tissue removed from the right temporal lobe of a 61-year-old male. PCR Amplification DNA samples were generated for SSCP analysis using PCR (7 min at 95’C, once; followed by 1 min at 95’C, 1 min at 58’C, 1 min at 72OC, for 35 cycles; then 10 min at 72OC) with the primer pair FLRIN (5’~CAAACCTTATACTCAATTCTCAACTC-3’), rFLRlN (5’~AAGGGGAATTTAAGATAGCTAGATTATC-3’). The reaction mixture was made up of the following: 30-70 ng of genomic DNA, a 70 uM concentration of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, a05 uM concentration of each primer, 10 mM Tris (pH 6.3) 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgC&, 0.25 U of Taq polymerase, 0.25 mM spermidine, and 0.1 ul of [@P]dCTP (3000 Gil ml) in a volume of 10 ul. SSCP Gel Analysis PCR products were diluted 30-fold in 0.1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, then I:1 in 95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA. 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol. Products were heated at 90°C for 3 min to denature the DNA, cooled on ice or at room temperature, and then loaded onto 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (49:1 polyacrylamide:methylenebis-acrylamide) containing 1 x or 0.5 x TBE (1 x TBE = 90 mM Trisborate (pH 7.81, 2 mM EDTA). Two conditions were routinely run for each set of samples: a gel at 4OC and a 5% glycerol gel at room temperature. Electrophoresis was carried out for both conditions at 40 W, constant power, in the same TBE buffer as that used in the gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to Whatman 3MM paper and dried on a vacuum slab gel dryer. Autoradiography with Kodak X-Omat AR film at -70aC with an intensifying screen overnight was usually sufficient to detect bands on film. Sequencing of SSCP Conformers Individual SSCP bands were cut directly from the dried gel, placed in 100 PI of distilled water, incubated at 37°C with shaking for 1 hr, and centrifuged briefly to pellet debris. A IO ul aliquot of the supernatant was used directly in a 100 ul PCR reaction. The primers used in the original amplification were used in this amplification as well, except that the 5’end of one primer contained additional sequence consisting of the universal sequencing primer from M13, and the 5’ end of the other primer included the sequence of the reverse sequencing primer. The double-stranded PCR product resulting from this amplification was purified by two centrifugation washes with a Centricon 100 column (Amicon), then sequenced following a test-site protocol suggested by Applied Biosystems, Inc. (Foster City, CA). This involved performing  Cloning and Manual Sequencing of the PCR Product from the FLR Exon PCR product was generated as above, except that a BamHl site was added to the 5’end of the primer FLRIN and an EcoRl site was added to the 5’ end of the primer rFLRIN. The PCR product was phenolchloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and digested with BamHl and EcoRI. The digested fragment was ligated with pBluesdript II phagemid vector also cut with BamHl and EcoRI. The ligation mixture was transformed into XLI-Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene). Double-stranded sequencing of ten independent plasmid clones was performed using Sequenase Version 2.0 (US Biochemicals) according to the manufacturers instructions. PCR Subcloning of Wild-Type and Mutant NFI GRD Subcloning of the wild-type NFI GRD is previously described in Martin et al. (1990). Two-step PCR was used to generate the mutant NFI GRD subclones. The first step included two PCR reactions with primer pair GM444 (5’-GGAGATGGTGTGTCGACCATGGAAGCCAAATCACAG-3’) and rGRDMU (5’-ACTCTGAAGTATCTGTGACATTAACTTCAA-3’, an internal antisense primer containing the mutated base [in bold]; here, T to G to generate the A to C mutant); and primer pair GRDMU (5’.TTGAAGTTAATGTCACAGATACTTCAGAGT-3’, an internal sense primer containing the mutated base [in bold]) and GM446 (5’-TAGGAl-KTCTAGAGCTCATGmTCTGGTTCTGGTGGTGGTGTT AACGTTTTCAAAGCCTTG-x nucleotides encoding the KT3 epitope are in bold). One microgram of cDNA clone FB15 (Xu et al., 1990a) was the template for each PCR reaction in a volume of 100 ~1. PCR was performed with a 0.8 uM concentration of each primer, a 0.2 mM concentration of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 10 mM Tris (pH 6.3) 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCl*, 0.01% gelatin, and 2.5 U of Taq polymerase. Reactions underwent 7 min at 95OC, once; followed by 1 min at 95OC, 2 min at 55’C, 1 min at 72OC, 25 times; 10 min at 72OC. The second step involved only one PCR reaction with primer pair GM444 and GM446. In the PCR reaction, 30 pl of each PCR product from the first step was used as template. The final products obtained after 25 cycles of amplification (7 min at 95’C, 1 time; 1 min at 95OC, 2minat550C,2minat720C,25times;l0minat720C)weresubcloned between the Ncol and Xbal sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pAcC4 (Luckow and Summers, 1966).  Cdl 280  Expression, of Wild-Type  Purification, and Mutant  and Activity NFl GRD  The methods used for biochemical scribed (Martin et al., 1990).

Altered expression of the retinoblastoma (RB) gene in small-cell carcinoma of the lung. Oncogene 3, 471-475.  The neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) gene product, neurofibromin, contains a GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain, or NF1 GRD, that is able to down-regulate p21ras by stimulating its intrinsic GTPase. Since p21ras.GTP is a major regulator of growth and differentiation, mutant neurofibromins resulting from somatic mutations in the NF1 gene might interfere with ras signaling pathways and contribute to the development of tumors. We describe an amino acid substitution in the NF1 GRD, altering Lys-1423, that has occurred in three tumor types: colon adenocarcinoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and anaplastic astrocytoma, and in one family with neurofibromatosis 1. The GAP activity of the mutant NF1 GRD is 200- to 400-fold lower than that of wild type, whereas binding affinity is unaffected. Thus, germline mutations in NF1 that cause neurofibromatosis 1 can also occur in somatic cells and contribute to the development of sporadic tumors, including tumors not associated with neurofibromatosis 1."

Loss of function of both copies of the RB1 gene is a causal event in the development of retinoblastoma. The predisposition to this tumor can be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Direct detection of the genetic defect is important for presymptomatic D N A diagnosis and genetic counseling in families with hereditary retinoblastoma. We have used multiplex polymerase chain reaction and high-resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to detect RB1 gene deletions as small as one base pair. By using three independent sets of amplification reactions, which cover 26% of the RB1 gene coding region, we identified RB1 gene deletions in the D N A of peripheral blood cells in 3 out of 24 (12.5%) unrelated patients with hereditary retinoblastoma. In one case, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor material was also used to detect the mutation. Sequencing of the mutated alleles revealed deletions of 1, 3 and 10 base pairs. Each deleted region was flanked by direct repeats.  Introduction Retinoblastoma is a childhood tumor that arises from retinal progenitor cells. It is initiated by the loss of both copies of the RB1 gene, which encodes for a cell cycle regulatory protein (Cavenee et al. 1983; Friend et al. 1986; Fung et al. 1987; Lee et al. 1987; Buchkovich et al. 1989; DeCaprio et al. 1989). Approximately 40% of patients carry a germline mutation at this locus in all cells (Vogel 1979). Three quarters of these alterations represent de novo mutations. Tumor formation is initiated by the somatic loss or inactivation of the second allele on Offprint requests to: H.H6fler, Institut ffir Pathologie, GSF Forschungszentrum fiir Umwelt und Gesundheit, Ingolst~idter Landstrasse 1, W-8042 Neuherberg, Federal Republic of Germany  the homologous chromosome. As somatic mutations are relatively frequent, these patients often develop multiple tumor loci in one or both eyes. However, some carriers develop only one tumor or escape tumor development completely. In 60% of all retinoblastoma patients, both alleles are inactivated by somatic mutations in a single cell. These patients develop only a single tumor focus. In familial cases, the chromosome carrying the mutated allele can often be identified by segregation analysis with polymorphic D N A markers (Wiggs et al. 1988; Scheffer et al. 1989; Yandell and Dryja 1989; Goddard et al. 1990). Because of the high frequency of de novo mutations, non-penetrance, or lack of informativity in some families, this indirect approach is often not feasible. Therefore, direct detection of the germline defect is the method of choice for identifying individuals at risk. Various deletions, insertions and point mutations at the RB1 locus have been characterized. Gross structural alterations as detectable by Southern blot hybridization are present in only 15% of patients with bilateral retinoblastoma (Kloss et al. 1991). Slightly higher rates have been found in tumor D N A (Goddard et al. 1988). The majority of mutations are too small to be detected by Southern blotting. Small deletions and insertions have successfully been detected by RNase mismatch analysis of tumor R N A (Dunn et al. 1988, 1989). Point mutations can be identified by enzymatic amplification and direct sequencing of genomic D N A (Yandell et al. 1989). All the mutations found so far show no preferential localization that would indicate a mutation hot spot in the gene. Therefore, it is necessary to screen all of the 27 exons and adjacent intronic sequences. To reduce the labor involved, we have simultaneously amplified different regions of the RB1 gene in a single polymerase chain reaction (multiplex PCR). The products can then be analyzed by high-resolution gel electrophoresis in order to detect small length alterations.  50 same conditions employing a single primer pair. Amplification from tumor D N A samples was carried out in a 50 gl reaction volume using 20 ~tl of the D N A solution and 40 PCR cycles.  Materials and methods  Patients Twenty-four unrelated patients with bilateral retinoblastoma were studied. Diagnosis of retinoblastoma was ascertained by standard histopathological criteria. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material was available in one case.  DNA isolation D N A was isolated from whole blood employing standard methods (Kunkel et al. 1977). D N A from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was prepared as follows. Tumor tissue was scratched away from a single 5-gm-thick unstained section. The material was dewaxed with xylene, rinsed with ethanol and vacuum desiccated. The dried tissue was mixed with 100 gl sterile water and heat-denatured for 8 min at 98~ A sample of 20 lal of this preparation was sufficient for one amplification reaction.  PCR amplification of DNA Amplification from whole blood D N A was performed in a total volume of 25 gl. The reaction mix contained 100 ng genomic DNA, 20nmol each dNTP, 1.25 units Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, Conn.) and 10-20pmol of each amplification primer using standard buffer conditions (10 mM TRIS-HC1 pH 8.3, 50 mM KC1, 1.5 mM MgCI:, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin). Thermal cycling (denaturing for 1 min at 94~ annealing for 30s at 56-58~ and extension for 30 s at 72~ was performed on an automated thermocycler (Bio-med, Theres, FRG); 35 cycles were preceded by 4min at 94~ and followed by an additional 4rain at 72~ For screening, three seperate reactions were performed. In each reaction, three different regions of the RB1 gene sequence were amplified simultaneously (multiplex-PCR). Primers were chosen from the sequence reported by Friend et al. (1986) (Table 1). They were synthesized on a D N A synthesizer (Applied Biosystems 394 D N A / R N A Synthesizer) and had 5'-extensions containing EcoRI restriction sites. When required, simplex PCR was performed under the  Table 1. Primer sets used for multiplex PCR. se, Sense primer; as, antisense primer  Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis An aliquot of the reaction mix (1/25) was electrophoresed at 10 V/ cm on a 20 cm long, 0.75 mm thick, 10% polyacrylamide gel (Protean IIxi, Bio-Rad). After 20-36h, the D N A was visualized by silver-staining (Schumacher et al. 1983). Gels were washed and fixed twice for 6min in 10% ethanol, 0.5% acetic acid. They were transferred to a 0.2% AgNO3 staining solution and agitated for 20 min. After washing several times in distilled water, the get was soaked in 1.5% NaOH, 0.4% formaldehyde (37%) and 0.01% NaBH4 for 7 min. To stop the developing process, the gels were transferred to a fixing solution (0.75% Na2CO3).  Sequence analysis The amplified products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis on 3% GTG NuSieve (FMC, Rockland, Me.), and recovered with a 0.45-1Jm filter unit (Ultrafree MC, Millipore, Yonezawa, Japan). The sequencing reaction was performed with Sequenase 2.0 (USB, Cleveland, Ohio) using a kinased PCR-primer (Casanova et al. 1990). For subcloning, amplification products were digested with EcoR1, purified by gel etectrophoresis in low melting agarose (GTG NuSieve, FMC, Rockland, Me.) and subcloned into pGEM4z. Plasmid DNA was recovered from cultures of single colonies. Sequencing was performed with c~-35SdATP using one of the amplification primers.

Two clones contained the wildtype sequence, whereas two showed a deletion of 10bp.  Discussion  Using multiplex P C R and high-resolution P A G E , we have been able to identify germline mutations in 3 out of 24 patients with bilateral retinoblastoma. In case 1 (family R6), a deletion of 3 bp in exon 16 leads to the elimination of Asn 48~in the protein. This deletion has not been found in other studies involving 150 unrelated patients. Therefore, it is unlikely that this deletion is a neutral genetic polymorphism. The deleted amino acid is part of a region known to interact with the SV40 T antigen (Huang et al. 1990). However, the function of Asn 48~ in the action of RB1 is unknown. The patient's family was only partly informative for intragenic polymorphisms (not shown). In particular, the patient's father was homozygous for all available markers, and prediction testing of the patient's brother was not possible. By simplex amplification and P A G E analysis, the deletion was detectable in all affected relatives and the patient's father. The patient's brother did not inherit the deletion and hence does not have an increased risk of developing retinoblastoma. This prediction would also be correct if the deletion were a neutral polymorphism marking a mutated allele. In the second family (family Fe), a 1-bp deletion in exon 20 was detected in all affected individuals. This mutation generates a new stop codon 30 bp downstream from the mutation site. This mutation was reduced to hemi- or homozygosity in the tumor tissue investigated. This result demonstrates that formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues also can be used for this form of analysis. The third patient (family Be) has a 10-bp deletion in exon 23 leading to a frame shift with a consequent disruption of the primary protein structure. Neither parent shows this alteration. Therefore, this mutation is a de novo germline mutation. Unless one of the parents has a germline mosaicism, the recurrence risk in another child will not be increased.  All mutations described here are part of, or flanked by, short direct repeats (Table 3). As a consequence, it is impossible to define which of the repeated motifs is deleted. Short direct repeats have also been described at the breakpoints of large deletions at the RB1 locus (Canning and Dryja 1989; Gregor et al. 1990; Hashimoto et al. 1991). Until now, this has not been reported for small deletions at this locus. However, a 3-bp direct repeat is present at the breakpoints of a 10-bp deletion (case RB543) reported by D u n n et al, (1989). Recently, the occurrence of distinctive sequence patterns in the vicinity of short ( < 20 bp) deletions in different genetic loci has been investigated (Krawczak and Cooper 1991). In all but one of the 60 deletions analyzed, direct repeats of between 2 bp and 8 bp were present. The goal of the study presented here was to examine the value of multiplex P C R for the detection of mutations at the RB1 locus. By surveying 26% of the RB1 open reading frame, we detected germline mutations in 3 out of 24 cases. F u r t h e r m o r e , the results presented here demonstrate the use of this approach for the identification of gene carriers among relatives, for the uncovering of non-penetrance, and for the detection of de novo germline mutations. The mutation may even be determined in material obtained from histopathological specimens. We are currently testing primers that also allow the amplification of splice junctions. Multiplex P C R and high-resolution gel electrophoresis may be a useful approach for the rapid detection of small RB1 mutations.  Acknowledgements.

The predisposition to this tumor can be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Direct detection of the genetic defect is important for presymptomatic DNA diagnosis and genetic counseling in families with hereditary retinoblastoma. We have used multiplex polymerase chain reaction and high-resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to detect RB1 gene deletions as small as one base pair. By using three independent sets of amplification reactions, which cover 26% of the RB1 gene coding region, we identified RB1 gene deletions in the DNA of peripheral blood cells in 3 out of 24 (12.5%) unrelated patients with hereditary retinoblastoma. In one case, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor material was also used to detect the mutation. Sequencing of the mutated alleles revealed deletions of 1, 3 and 10 base pairs. Each deleted region was flanked by direct repeats.Detection of small RB1 gene deletions in retinoblastoma by multiplex PCR and high-resolution gel electrophoresis."
"1","We analyzed the promoter region and all the coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of the protein C gene in a Japanese patient with recurrent thromboembolism and complete protein C deficiency. By sequencing these fragments we identified a previously undescribed mutation. A guanine residue was replaced by an adenine residue converting Gly-292 (GGC) to Ser (AGC) in the last exon coding for the catalytic domain. Substitution of this key amino acid, invariably conserved in the serine protease superfamily to which protein C belongs, probably leads to destabilization of the tertiary structure. In a transient expression assay with COS 7 cells, the protein C level was extremely low in the culture medium of the cells transfected with the mutated protein C expression vector, as compared with the normal vector. In contrast, the cell extracts contained similar amounts of mutant and normal protein C, suggesting impaired secretion of the mutant protein C. Using mutagenic primers to introduce a new PvuII site into the mutant allele, we made a study of the family members in this patient's pedigree, revealing that the mutant allele had been inherited in the affected individuals in this pedigree.Homozygous protein C deficiency: identification of a novel missense mutation that causes impaired secretion of the mutant protein C KOJI YAMAMOTO, TADASHI MATSUSHITA, ISAMU SUGIURA, JUNKI TAKAMATSU, EIICHI IWASAKI, HIDEO WADA, KATSUMI DEGUCHI, SHIGERU SHIRAKAWA, and HIDEHIKO SAITO NAGOYA AND MIE, JAPAN  We analyzed the promoter region and all the coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of the protein C gene in a Japanese patient with recurrent thromboembolism and complete protein C deficiency.

Some individuals with partial deficiency have relatively infrequent thromboembolic episodes, which has led to the claim  An e4itorial relevant to this article appears on p. 592 of this issue of the JouRNAL.  Volume 119 Number 6  Homozygous protein C deficiency  · Ac .

Heterozygous individuals are indicated by a dot in the middle of the circle (females) or a dot in the middle of tile square (males). Protein C enzyme activity and antigen levels are indicated for each individual in the pedigree and are represented as the percentage of the amount of activity or antigen found in pooled plasma from 20 normal individuals. Normal protein C activity is considered to fall into the range of 78.3% to 121.7% of the protein C activity found in the pooled blood. Enzyme activity is written above the bar, and antigen level is shown below the bar.  that partial protein C deficiency alone should not be characterized as an important risk factor. 8 Individuals with complete protein C deficiency or those who have extremely low levels of plasma protein C are sometimes identified as having purpura fulminans as newborns. 9 •10 However, some of these imlividuals survive beyond the neonatal period into adulthood with or without histories of thrombosis. 11 Thus the spectrum of clinical manifestations caused by protein C deficiency is rather wide. Usually protein C deficiency is thought to be transmitted as an autosomal dominant with a high degree of penetrance, but in families with individuals with complete deficiency, the mode of inheritance has been classified as an autosomal recessive. Since the protein C gene has been cloned, 12 it has become feasible to study hereditary protein C deficiency at the molecular level. It is possible that the phenotypic heterogeneity of this disorder may reflect underlying heterogeneity at the molecular level. Thus, studying DNA sequence abnormalities may be helpful in explaining the broad range of clinical severity of protein C deficiency. Only a handful of cases, however, have so far been analyzed at the DNA level. 13 - 16 We sequenced the promoter region and all of the coding regions and splice junctions of the protein C gene in a young woman with complete protein C deficiency. We identified a novel point mutation located in exon IX that would cause substitution of a serine in place of a conserved glycine residue at amino acid positiqn number 292. Furthermore, we have shown that this point mutation was inherited by the affected individuals in this family. To elucidate the mechanism by which the missense mutation causes protein C deficiency, we have performed a transient expression as-  say with COS 7 cells. The mutant protein C was secreted into the culture medium at a very low level, indicating that this mutation is the molecular basis for protein C deficiency in this pedigree. METHODS Description of the patient and her family. The patient is a 31-year-old woman who reached adulthood without clinical evidence of thrombosis. Her first thromboembolic episode occurred at the age of 31 and was an infarction in the right lateral cerebrum. Since then she has had recunent episodes of venous thrombosis in both of her legs as well as mesenteric venous thrombosis. The protein C activity and antigen levels in this patient were undetectable (less than 5% of normal), while the activities of antithrombin III, proteinS, and plasminogen were within the range of nmmal. Her mother died at 35 years of age because of a cerebral thromboembolism, and her brother died at birth for unknown reasons. Fig. I is a pedigree of her family and shows that protein C activity levels of her father and other relatives are low. It also indicates that her parents were first cousins. From the pedigree alone it appears that the patient is homozygous and that her family members are heterozygous for protein C deficiency. Plasma and DNA samples. Blood samples were drawn from the patient, her family members, and normal individuals after informed consent was obtained. Nine parts of blood were mixed with one part of 3.8% trisodium citrate, and the plasma was separated by centrifugation at 34,000 g for 15 minutes at 4~ C, then stored at -80° C until use. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes by phenol extraction as previously described. 17 Protein C and other assays. Protein C anticoagulation activity was determined by using protein C-deficient plasma as a substrate and Protac (Staclot Protein C; Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) as an activator of protein C. 18 The protein C antigen level was measured by using a  684  J Lab Clin Med June 1992  Yamamoto et al.

Protein C activity and antigen levels were expressed as percentages of those observed in pooled plasma collected from 20 normal individuals. The pooled plasma was arbitrarily defined as having 100% protein C activity and antigen levels. Assays for the activities of antithrombin III, protein S, and plasminogen were performed as described earlier. 19 Preparation of oligonucleotide primers. We designed eight pairs of oligonucleotide primers for PCR (shown in Table I) that covered the 5' untranslated (presumed promoter) region and all nine exons and exon-intron boundaries of the protein C gene. These primers have an EcoRI restriction endonuclease cleavage site that is convenient for subsequent cloning and sequencing. All primers were prepared as described earlier. 20 Performance of PCR. PCR was performed as previously described21 with the following minor modifications. 22 A 100 j.Ll aliquot of the PCR reaction mixture contained 1 j.Lg of genomic DNA in 50 mmoi!L KCl, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mmoi!L MgC1 2 , 0.01% (wUvol) gelatin, 200 [Lmol/L of each dNTP, 100 pmol of each primer, and 2.5 U of recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer-Cetus, Norwalk, Conn.). The mixture was overlaid with mineral oil to prevent condensation and was subjected to the following series of steps for a total of 35 amplification cycles. The samples were denatured at 94° C for 1 minute, annealed at 60° c for 2 minutes, and heated to 72° c for 2 minutes for polymerization. The reactions were performed in an automatic thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer-Cetus). DNA sequencing. The PCR products were digested with restriction endonucleases, then subcloned into M13 vectors. These subcloned PCR products were then sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method as described previously. 20,23  Constructions of expression vectors. An expression vector for the normal protein C (pEUK-PC) was constructed by insetiing a eDNA fragment coding for protein C into the pEUK-C1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.) as follows. The eDNA coding for wild-type protein C was provided by Dr. Earl Davie, Seattle, Wash., in pUC19. Between two EcoRI sites, the eDNA for protein C contained 69 noncoding bases 5' of the ATG initiation site, 126 bases of leader sequence, 1383 bases coding for the entire protein C molecule, and 202 noncoding bases 3' of the TAG stop codon, this latter region including two poly A signals. This fragment was excised from the pUC19 vector by EcoRI digestion and then ligated into the multiple cloning site of the pBluescript KS II(+) vector. The insert direction was confirmed by digestion with Nael. For insertion into the mammalian cell expression vector, the eDNA was excised from the pBluescript KS II(+) by using an Xbal -XIwl restriction digestion and was inserted into these same restriction sites of the vector pEUK-C1, which has the SV40 late promoter 5' upstream of the Xbal site. Mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis of the protein C coding sequences was performed by using an oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis system (version 2.0; Amersham, Arlington, Ill.). 24 •25 We prepared the following mutant oligonucleotide  5'-AGGGTCTCCTGGCTGGCCTGATTGAGCTCG-3' with a DNA synthesizer (model 391; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). The mutant protein C eDNA was sequenced by dideoxy chain termination technique as described earlier, 20 with the double-strand DNA as template, to verify the mutation and the fidelity of the remaining sequence. The fragment containing the mutated protein C was inserted into the expression vector (pEUK-mPC). Transient expression of recombinant protein C.

A transversion in the last exon of the gene from guanine to adenine (GGC to AGC) converted Gly-292 to Ser (Fig. 2). This mutation was confirmed by sequencing five independent clones from this region. Analysis of the family members. To determine whether this mutation was hereditary, we examined the DNA from family members of this patient by using PCR amplification with mutagenic primers 20 •27 •28 as follows: 5' -CTCAGGAATTCGCCACTGGGGAGAGGCTCC-3'  RESULTS Analysis of the protein  c  5' -AGCCCCAGCCCGTCACGAGGGTCTCCC* A *GC-3' gene.

Strategy for direct detection of a single nucleotide substitution when using mutagenic primers. The mutation, substitution of a guanine residue with an adenine residue in exon IX of the protein C gene, is indicated by white letters. We used mutagenic primers to replace a C residue (nucleotide 8592) with aT residue (indicated by T*) and an A residue (nucleotide 8593) with a G residue (indicated by G*). This created a new Pvuii site (CAGCTG) in the fragments produced by amplification of mutant alleles and yielded two fragments of 271 base pair (bp) and 29 base pair in length after enzyme digestion. After amplification, the normal allele does not have the restriction enzyme cleavage site and generates only a 300 base pair fragment after Pvuii digestion.  did not have this restriction site, so Pvull digestion of that allele yielded a single 300 base pair fragment. Thu~ family members carrying the mutation were identified as those whose DNA was shown by this analysis to contain two restriction fragments of 271 and 29 base pair in length. When the genomic DNA fragments of Japanese individuals with normal protein C activity and antigen levels were subjected to this analysis, Pvuii digestion yielded only a single 300 base pair fragment in all cases, indicating that these individuals are all homozygous for the normal allele. Pvull digestion of PCR products from the patient's family members revealed that only DNA isolated from her paternal grandfather (I-1) and paternal uncle (Il-l), who both had normal protein C activity and antigen levels, did not yield the two restriction fragments that indicate the homozygosity for the normal allele (Fig. 4). Clones obtained from the family members who have partial deficiency in protein C (II-2, II-3, II-4, and II-5) produced two  bands after Pvull digestion: a 300 base pair fragment and a 271 base pair fragment, indicating that they each carry one mutant allele and one normal allele. (The 29 base pair fragment could not be detected in these gels.) DNA taken from the proband (III-1), who is completely deficient in protein C, had only the 271 base pair fragment after Pvull digestion, confirming that she is homozygous for the mutant allele. Transient expression of recombinant protein C. To ensure that the missense mutation identified in this pedigree could cause the deficiency of protein C, we construct~d a protein C expression vector, pEUK-mPC, containing the abnormal sequence, as described in Methods, and trarisfected it into COS 7 cells for a transient expression assay. An analysis for protein C in the culture medium and in the cell extracts, as assayed by ELISA with a rabbit polyclonal antibody, is shown in Table II. About 90% of the normal recombinant protein C synthesized in the COS 7 cells was secreted into the culture medium, whereas the level of  Volume 119 Number 6  Homozygous protein C deficiency  687  (bp) 1 1078  300bp 271 bp  603 310 281 271 234 194 118  Fig. 4. Analysis by PCR amplification followed by Pvuii digestion of the protein C alleles in the family members of an individual who is homozygous for protein C deficiency. A region of exon IX in the protein C gene was amplified by PCR with the mutagenic primers described in Fig. 3 and shown in Table I. After amplification by PCR, the exon IX fragments were digested with Pvuii and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 9% gel, then stained with ethidium bromide. We used DNA molecular weight marker 4(<l>Xl74/ Haelll digest) from Nippon gene, Japan, as the marker on the right side. The 29 base pair (bp) fragment was not detected in this gel. The gel shows that Pvuii digestion of exon IX from all of the individuals in the pedigree who had partial deficiency for protein C produced bands of 271 base pair and 300 base pair in length. The 271 base pair fragment results from digestion of the mutant allele, and the 300 base pair band results from digestion of the normal allele. DNA from exon IX of protein C from the individuals in the pedigree who do not have deficiency of protein C by enzymatic and antigenic analysis (l-1 and Il-l) yielded only a single band of 300 base pair in length after Pvuii digestion.  the mutant protein C secreted was only about 2% of that of the normal recombinant protein secreted. Their cellular contents of protein C, however, did not differ significantly, suggesting impaired secretion of the mutant protein C. DISCUSSION  The molecular basis of hereditary protein C deficiency is almost completely unknown in the majority of p~tients afflicted with this problem. Romeo et al. 13 have reported that mutation of a single nucleotide (a C-to-T transition) at Arg-306 in one pedigree of a heterozygous deficiency results in a nonsense mutation. They also described a mutation in which a G-to-C  transversion caused substitution of Cys for Trp-402, a missense mutation. In the latter case, the disulfide bonds generated by the variant cystein residue are thought to interfere with the correct folding of the protein, resulting in destabilization of the molecule. . Protein C Tochigi 14 and protein C London 15 have also been reported to be abnormal protein C molecules. In both cases, a C-to-T transition causing replacement of Arg-169 with a tryptophan residue-at the site of protein C activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex- is thought to be responsible for defective activation of the molecule and to result in thromboembolic disorder. More recently a preliminary rep?rt by Gandrille et al. 16 described the identification  688  J Lab Clin Med June 1992  Yamamoto et al.  Table II.

The cells were harvested with trypsin, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline solution, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline solution, and lysed by 0.1% NP-40 solution. Protein C levels in the culture medium and in the cell extracts were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The result was a mean of five separate experiments. PC, Protein C.  of two mutations in ex on VI (conesponding to exon VII in the report of Plutzky et al. 29 ), which encodes the linker and activator portions of the protein C molecule. One of these was a C-to-T transition that created a nonsense codon at Arg-157, and the other was a G-to-A transition converting Arg-178 to Gln. Further details of the effect of these mutations on functional aspects of protein C have not been described. We have identified a novel point mutation in the protein C gene of an individual who has complete deficiency in protein C, which causes Gly-292 to be replaced by Ser (Fig. 2). We sequenced the entire protein C gene in this patient and found only this single point mutation; therefore, it is thought to underlie the clinical manifestations of protein C deficiency in this patient. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the DNA abnormality in an individual with apparent homozygous protein C deficiency. Glycine-292 structurally conesponds to glycine-133 in eukaryotic serine proteases and in bacterial trypsin. 30 This residue is invariably conserved in serine proteases that contain this biochemical domain, including bovine prothrombin, the trypsinogens, the chymotrypsinogens, and pig kallikrein. Computer simulation of the three-dimensional structure of trypsin indicates that it has one a-helix, two six-stranded 13-sheets, and six disulfide bonds?' Glycine-133 of trypsin belongs to the group of residues that form 13-sheets, and it is located at the base of the molecule. 31 It is infened that replacing a nonpolar glycine residue with a polar serine residue at this site in the protein C molecule influences the three-dimensional structure, leading to its destabilization or perhaps inactivation. I Our transfection experiment data appear to provide strong evidence for the impairment of the secretory process of the mutant protein C, because this mutation significantly reduced the amount of the mutant protein  C secreted into the medium, whereas the cellular content was almost same with normal recombinant protein C (Table II). Much evidence has been found that abnormal secretory or plasma membrane proteins are often specifically retained within the rough endoplasmic reticulum and are not secreted. 32 It is conceivable that this missense mutation causes significant alteration of protein C that in turn probably causes a substantial change in its secondary and tertiary structure, thereby affecting its posttranslational transport through the intracellular secretory compartments. The in vitro study also suggests the instability of the mutant protein C within the cells, possibly because of the altered conformation, because no abnormal intracellular accumulation of protein C was observed in spite of the apparently retarded secretion. The analysis we describe when using PCR with mutagenic primers (Fig. 3) followed by Pvull digestion provides a relatively easy screening procedure for this protein C mutation. The variant restriction pattern we describe here correlates completely with protein C deficiency in this pedigree and is absent in all individuals we have examined who have normal protein C activity and antigen levels. The proband apparently inherited two copies of the same mutation, one from each of her parents, who were cousins. It also appears that the 50% reduction of protein C levels found in several individuals in this pedigree can be attributed to this missense mutation, because all those individuals are heterozygous for the mutation.

"1","We have discovered two different point mutations in a single codon of the X-linked androgen-receptor (AR) gene in two pairs of unrelated families who have complete androgen insensitivity (resistance) associated with different AR phenotypes in their genital skin fibroblasts. One mutation is a C-to-T transition at a CpG sequence near the 5' terminus of exon 6; it changes the sense of codon 773 from arginine to cysteine, ablates specific androgen-binding activity at 37 degrees C, and eliminates a unique KpnI site at the intron-exon boundary. The other mutation is a G-to-A transition that changes amino acid 773 to histidine and eliminates an SphI site. This mutant AR has a normal androgen-binding capacity at 37 degrees C but has a reduced affinity for androgens and is thermolabile in their presence. Transient transfection of COS cells with cDNA expression vectors yielded little androgen-binding activity at 37 degrees C from Arg773Cys and abundant activity with abnormal properties from Arg773His, thereby providing the pathogenicity of both sequence alterations. This conclusion coincides with the following facts about evolutionary preservation of the position homologous to Arg773 in the AR: it is occupied by Arg or lysine in the progesterone, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid receptors, and it is within a 14-amino-acid region of their steroid-binding domains that share approximately 85% amino acid identity.Am.

Introduction Testosterone and Sct-dihydrotestosterone share primary responsibility for male sexual morphogenesis and for virilization at puberty (Wilson 1978). Their actions are mediated by the androgen receptor (AR), the product of a Xq12-linked gene (Brown et al. 1989). The AR belongs to the superfamily of ligandactivated, transcription-regulating proteins whose DNA-binding domains, encoded by exons 2 and 3 (or Received October 14, 1991; revision received January 14, 1992.

Its carboxy-terminal androgen-binding domain, encoded by exons 4-8 (or D-H), shares ".'50% overall amino acid sequence homology with the steroid-binding domains of the receptors for progesterone, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid (Chang et al. 1988; Lubahn et al. 1988; Kuiper et al. 1989; Tilley et al. 1989; Govindan 1990). These four steroid receptors form a subfamily within the superfamily. The stereochemistry that permits the AR to bind androgen selectively, and how an androgenic ligand contributes to the transcriptional regulatory attributes of an A-R complex are unknown. To help provide such information, we (Ris-Stalpers et al. 1990, 1991; Sai et al. 1990; Trifiro et al. 1991a, 1991b) and others (Brown et al. 1988, 1990; Marcelli et al. 1990a, 1990b, 1991a, 1991 b; McPhaul et al. 1991) have be143  144  gun to use molecular-genetic techniques to study the AR of individuals and families who have different degrees of androgen insensitivity. Their clinical phenotypes vary from women with the syndrome of complete testicular feminization to men with mild undervirilization. In this paper we report two pairs of Canadian families with complete androgen insensitivity that share two different missense mutations at codon 773 in the androgen-binding domain of the AR.  Prior et al. Cell Culture and Assay of Specific Androgen-binding Activity  Subjects, Material, and Methods  Labium majus skin fibroblast strains were developed after obtaining informed consent, according to an approved protocol. They and the COS-1 monkey kidney cells used as transfectants were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Earle's salts) supplemented with 5%-10% FCS, 1 mM pyruvate, 10 mg garamycin/liter, 60 mg of penicillin G/liter, and 60 mg of streptomycin/liter. The specific androgenbinding activity of monolayers in Petri dishes was quantitated and characterized according to the method described in detail by Gottlieb et al. (1987).  The Propositae and Their Families  DNA Isolation and Southern Analysis  The mother of family 1 is French-Canadian. As reported by Pinsky et al. (1977), two of her 46,XY children have the typical clinicopathologic features of complete androgen insensitivity. Labium majus skin fibroblasts of the younger (coded here as LEL) have specific androgen-binding activity that is <5 fmol/mg protein, at 370C (i.e., were receptor negative). We were not permitted to study her sister, whose menarche was at age 18 years, or her three daughters, each of whom has apparently unaffected children. The mother of family 2 is English-Canadian. As recorded by Kaufman et al. (1976), her daughter (coded as TML) and two sisters have complete testicular feminization. TML's labium majus skin fibroblasts have specific androgen-binding activity that is <5 fmol/ mg protein. The mother of family 3 is French-Canadian. As reported by Gottlieb et al. (1987), her daughter (coded as 30285) has the typical clinical, endocrine, and pathologic signs of complete androgen insensitivity. The AR in her genital skin fibroblasts has a normal binding capacity, but it has a decreased affinity for androgens and is unstable in their presence. The mother of family 4 is English-Canadian. She was born when her father was about 45 years old. Her only affected daughter (coded as 6779) presented at age 18 years with primary amenorrhea and sparse to absent sexual hair, despite otherwise normal pubertal feminization. Her peripheral lymphocyte karyotype was 46,XY. Intraabdominal exploration exposed two pelvic testes, histologically; the left had a nodule of Leydig cell hyperplasia, and the right was attached to a rudimentary fallopian tube. The androgen-binding activity in 6779's genital skin fibroblasts is described here for the first time (see Results).  DNA was isolated from genital skin fibroblasts (Sai et al. 1990) or peripheral lymphocytes (Greenberg et al. 1987), precisely as described. Blots were obtained with either diazobenzyloxymethyl (DBM) paper (Alwine et al. 1979) or Hybond-N membrane. cDNA probes spanning the coding region were labeled to a specific activity >5 x 108 cpm / gg, by random priming (Feinberg and Vogelstein 1983). RNA Isolation and Northern Analysis  RNA was isolated from genital skin fibroblasts by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method, precisely according to the method described by Sai et al. (1990). Poly(A + ) RNA was isolated using the Fast Track Kit (Invitrogen), was fractionated on 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 M formaldehyde (Murphy and Dotzlaw 1989), was blotted onto DBM paper (Alwine et al. 1979), and was probed with a 0.7-kb AR cDNA, overlapping its DNA- and androgen-binding domains (Trifiro et al. 1991a). Reverse Transcription (RT), PCR Amplification, and Sequencing of Androgen-binding Domain in the AR cDNA RT and PCR amplication of the portion of normal and LEL cDNA encoding the androgen-binding domain was carried out exactly according to the method described by Sai et al. (1990). Each product was blunt-ended by using T4 DNA polymerase, was digested with EcoRI, was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel, and was electroeluted. The fragments obtained were ligated with HinclI/EcoRI-digested Bluescript (SK) vectors (Stratagene) by using 2 units of T4 DNA ligase at 14°C for 18 h. The resulting plasmids (pSK.hAR and pSK.hARLEL) were transformed into  XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene). After large-scale plasmid  145  Androgen Resistance: hAR Arg773Cys or His preparations, double-stranded DNA was sequenced by using both T7 and T3 primers, as described in the Sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemical). PCR Amplification of Genomic Exons  For exons 2-8, we used conditions and sets of flanking intronic primers defined by Trifiro et al. (1991a). Exon 1 of LEL was amplified in sections according to the method described by Lubahn et al. (1989), with two modifications: (a) we used primer 1. lB0 (5'GCTCTGGGACGCAACCTCTCTC) in place of their primer A2; and (b), for the GC-rich region encoding the glycine tract, we used VENT polymerase (New England Biolabs) as recommended, except for 5 mM Mg2+ and 50:150 gM dGTP:7deaza-dGTP (Innis 1990). Direct DNA Sequencing  This was done exactly according to the method described by Trifiro et al. (1991b) for exons 2-8, and, for parts of exon 1, it was done by using primers (AlA8) described by Lubahn et al. (1989). In addition, we used our primers 1. lA (5'GTGGAAGATTCAGCCAAGCT) and 1.lb (5'TTGCTGTTCCTCATCCAGGA) for a region between primers A7 and A8. 7-deaza-dGTP replaced dGTP for sequencing exon 1 regions encoding the glutamine or glycine tracts. Construction of AR cDNA Expression Vector with Arg773Cys  Both a 147-bp EcoRI-HincII fragment containing codon 773 from pSK.hARLEL and a 760-bp KpnIHinclI fragment from pGEM-3Z.hARo were ligated into a KpnI/partial EcoRI-digested fragment of pGEM3Z.hARo, to form pGEM-3Z.hARLEL. pSV.ARo is a pBR328-based, full-length hAR cDNA expression vector containing the SV40 early promoter and the rabbit 3-globin poly-A signal (Brinkmann et al. 1989). A 1,011-bp KpnI-PvuI fragment of it was replaced by a homologous insert from KpnI-PvuI-treated pGEM3Z.hARLEL containing codon 773. The exclusive presence of the C- T substitution was ascertained. Construction of AR cDNA Expression Vector with Arg773His  Two opposite-sense 20-nucleotide oligonucleotides synthesized to contain the appropriate singlenucleotide substitution (sense: 5'AATGAGTACCACATGCACAA 3' and antisense: 5'TTGTGCATGTGGTACTCATT 3'). With normal hAR cDNA used as a template, separate PCRs were conducted: (a) the sense oligonucleotide with the downstream antiwere  sense primer and (b) the antisense oligonucleotide with an upstream sense primer. The two products, containing upstream or downstream sequences, overlapped at the mutation site. They and the same up- and downstream primers, were used in a second PCR. The single product was cleaved with ScaI and BstBI to yield a mutated 276-bp fragment that was ligated into the ScaI-BstBItreated expression vector, pBSV.hARo, a form of pSV.hARo modified to contain a unique BstBI site. Recombinant clones were tested for resistance to SphI digestion and were sequenced for exclusivity. Construction of the MMTV.GH Reporter Plasmid  pMMTV.CAT (Miesfeld et al. 1986), obtained from J. Drouin (Montreal), was digested with NheI and HindIII to yield a 1,447-bp fragment containing its long-terminal repeat (LTR). p4GH, a pUC12 vector (Nichols Institute, Los Angeles) containing the human growth hormone (hGH) gene, was digested with XbaI and HindIII. The LTR fragment was ligated cohesively into p4GH because NheI and XbaI ends are sticky. The resulting reporter construct puts the hGH gene under the regulatory influence of four glucocorticoid/progesterone/androgen response elements from the LTR of the MMTV. Transfection of COS- I Cells by Electroporation  COS-1 cells were washed and resuspended in icecold PBS to a concentration of 20 million/ml. A 0.5ml portion of the cell suspension was transferred to a sterile, cold cuvette (electrode gap 0.4 cm; Bio-Rad), 10-20 gg of plasmid DNA were added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 5 min. The shock parameters were 250 V, 960 RF, and 35 ms. After a 10-min, postshock incubation on ice, the cells in each cuvette were resuspended in 1.5 ml of medium (if more than one cuvette was used, the suspensions were fused), and 0.5 million cells were placed in each 35-mm petri dish. At specified times after transfection, various concentrations of androgen were added to the medium, the specific androgen-binding activity in the cells was characterized, and, when applicable, the concentration of growth hormone in the medium was measured radioimmunometrically as recommended by the assay kit (Nichols Institute, Los Angeles). Western Analysis of the AR in Transfected COS- I Cells Confluent monolayers ("'5 million cells) in 60-mm petri dishes were washed twice with PBS and were  Prior et al.  146  lysed with 80 il of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 100 mM DTT, and 100 gg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/ ml. Thereafter, preparation of the cell extracts, SDS-PAGE, western transfer, by electroblotting, and blocking were performed according to the methods described by Sambrook et al. (1989). The nitrocellulose filters were incubated overnight at 4°C, with a monoclonal antibody (F39.41) to a peptide (SP61) corresponding to amino acids 301-320 in the N-terminal portion of the hAR (Zegers et al. 1991). The antibody was diluted 1/400 in 10 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl (Tris-buffered saline, [TBS]). After three washes in TBS, the filters were incubated with a 1 / 1,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G for 1 h at room temperature. After three more washes each in TBS with and without 0.5 % Tween-20, the blots were developed with 4-chloro-1naphthanol in the presence of H202 for 15 min.  Results Androgen-binding Activity  The genital skin fibroblasts of LEL (family 1) and TML (family 2) had negligible specific androgenbinding activity (i.e., receptor negative) at 37°C, as previously reported by Kaufman et al. (1976) and Pin-  sky et al. (1977). In contrast, those of 30285 (family 3) and 6779 (family 4) had activities in the normal range (12-50 fmol/mg protein). The AR in 30285's fibroblasts had previously been reported (a) to have a subnormal affinity for androgen, by both Scatchard analysis and off-rate analysis, (b) to form thermolabile A-R complexes, and (c) to resist up-regulation during prolonged incubation with the nonmetabolizable androgens, mibolerone, and methyltrienolone (Gottlieb et al. 1987). The cells of 6779 also failed to up-regulate, and they formed A-R complexes that dissociated at abnormally fast rates, identical to those of 30285  (fig. 1). Identification of the Mutations  Major AR gene disruption was ruled out, both by Southern analysis after digestion with BamHI, EcoRI, and HindIII and the use of various cDNA probes (Trifiro et al. 1991a) and by northern analysis that revealed normal amounts of an "-'10-kb AR mRNA in the fibroblasts of LEL and 6779 (fig. 2). The Arg773Cys mutation. - Reflecting a C-to-T transition (fig. 3), this mutation was identified first in LEL by indirect sequencing of the androgen-binding domain (exons 4-8) after PCR amplification of her cDNA. It was confirmed by directly sequencing both strands of PCR-amplified genomic exon 6 (fig. 4). Its apparent uniqueness was demonstrated by sequencing exons 1-4 in like manner.  0)  ct n 0._  CD  E  0 0  0  0) C) 0) 0  CL CL a)  0  0  30  60  90  120  0  30  60  90  120  0  30  60  90  120  Time (minutes) at 320C Rates of dissociation, at 32°C, of MB-, 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-, and methyltrienolone (MT)-receptor complexes Figure I in genital skin fibroblasts of subjects 30285 and 6779 and of a control. The cells had been incubated with 3 nM of the indicated androgen for 2 h at 37°C.

Southern analysis of KpnI-digested genomic DNA uncovered only TML among 11 unrelated subjects with complete androgen insensitivity. She and LEL have a band of "415 kb in place of ones at "410 and 5-kb (fig. 5). KpnI digestion of PCR-amplified exon 6 showed that the affected sister of LEL had only KpnIresistant exon 6 in her peripheral lymphocyte DNA (fig. 6, left panel). It is surprising that two different samples of their mother's DNA yielded only KpnIsensitive exon 6. Hence, she is a somatic-germ cell mosaic. We were not permitted to pursue this. TML's mother, also an obligate heterozygote, does have the two fragments representing KpnI sensitivity of the normal exon 6 allele (fig. 6, right panel). The Arg773His mutation. -Representing a G-to-A transition (figs. 4 and 7, top), this mutation was discovered in both 30285 (family 3) and 6779 (family 4) by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified exon 6. Its uniqueness was defined by sequencing the other exons and not finding any abnormality in them. Sphl analysis of the Arg773His mutation. -The nucleotide alteration predicted ablation of an SphI site (fig. 4). As expected (fig. 7, bottom), 30285 only had the parental product of PCR-amplified exon 6, and we discovered that her mother was probably heterozygous: her DNA had the mutant SphI-resistant allele  MCH6  DB(1 3082)  WPO9 LNCaP  6779 NHL  LEL  Northern analysis of the AR mRNA in genital skin Figure 2 fibroblasts of a control, MCH-6; LEL and 6779, two propositae in the present paper; DB (13082), a subject with complete androgen insensitivity (CAI) due to a premature translation termination signal (Trifiro et al. 1991b); and NHL, a subject with CAI whose mutation is not known.

Expression of Mutant AR cDNAs and Transactivational Activity of Mutant ARs  When pSVhAR.LEL (Arg773Cys) is transfected into COS-1 cells, they acquire a normal amount of AR protein (fig. 8), but their A-R complexes dissociate 15 times faster than normal, even at 220C, and they have a low specific androgen-binding activity that is profoundly thermolabile (table 1). Furthermore, when incubated with 3 nM mibolerone (MB) after cotransfection with pMMTV.GH, insignificant amounts of GH are produced (table 2). When pSVhAR.30285 (Arg773His) is transfected into COS-1 cells, they acquire abundant androgenbinding activity because of an AR with a lower than normal affinity for androgen (figs. 9 and 10). When cotransfected with pMMTV.GH and incubated for 72 h with <6.4 nM MB, they reached maximal GH production at 3.2 nM; replicates transfected with the normal AR cDNA needed <1 nM (fig. 11, left). We also measured the androgen-binding activity of transfected COS-1 cells after (a) continuous incubation with various concentrations of MB for 72 h ("regulated") or (b) incubation for only 2 h, at 70-72 h  149  Androgen Resistance: hAR Arg773Cys or His  bp  3  4  5  6  bp  bp  1  2  3  4  5  bp  6 -  242190 147 _ 141  -  603  266 188 -310 281  266  110-  271 -  188-  234  -194  78  67-  118  78-72  PAGE (8%) analysis after KpnI digestion of PCR-amplified exon 6.

The COS-1 cells had 'v2,000 fmol of "basal" binding activity/mg protein, at 6.4 nM MB, whether transfected with the normal or mutant AR cDNA (fig. 11, right); however, during prolonged incubation with MB, the normal binding activity went up, while the mutant's went down. Discussion A fully sequenced hAR cDNA, knowledge of flanking intronic sequence, and PCR have enabled us to identify, in two pairs of unrelated families with complete androgen insensitivity, either a single C- T transition or a single G- A transition in codon 773 (CGC) of exon 6 (or exon G), a transition that changes its sense from Arg to Cys (TGC) or His (CAC), respectively. Strong circumstantial evidence pointed to the pathogenicity of these substitutions. First, we did not find either substitution in the AR of 10 normal X chromosomes or in conjunction with another proved or putative pathogenic sequence alteration in any of 39 other families with complete or partial androgen in-  sensitivity. Second, the positions homologous to AR Arg773 are occupied by Arg or Lys in the three other receptors of the AR subfamily, and it is in a region of the androgen-binding domain of the AR that shares 85% amino acid identity with the homologous region in their respective steroid-binding domains. Third, Arg differs markedly from Cys or His, physiocochemically. To prove pathogenicity, we created recombinant hAR cDNA expression vectors containing each of the transitions, and we transiently transfected one or the other into COS-1 cells. At 37°C the AR made in these cells had either barely measurable androgen-binding activity (Arg773Cys) or an abundant amount of an abnormal form of it (Arg773His). These results matched those for genital skin fibroblasts of the subjects. Furthermore, the Arg773His AR required a higher concentration of androgen to achieve the same maximum GH reporter gene response as was achieved by the normal AR. This could be explained easily both by its decreased affinity for androgen and by the increased turnover of its A-R complexes in the pro-  GATC  o His  G ATC  GATC  G ATC  1 A  A  [s 772 L o 1A*, PGA  His  T2  L u]  C Gi*G ~~~~~~~~~~G1 Ar  'S-T-?

In addition, the intrinsic transactivational competence of these complexes may be subnormal. The strikingly different mutant AR phenotypes of the two codon 773 substitutions will help to elucidate several physicochemical properties of the AR. For instance, Arg773Cys may disrupt androgen binding and retention more, and may cause greater AR thermolability, than does Arg773His, because Cys forms intramolecular disulfide bonds (Wilson et al. 1986). Marcelli et al. (1991la) compared a natural Cys substitution with an artificial methionine one at Arg773. In extracts of transfected cells, both caused thermal instability of androgen binding, but only the former affected its affinity. It should be noted that the genital skin fibroblasts of their subject with Arg773Cys appear to have a sevenfold-reduced steady-state level of AR mRNA, and they consider this a factor in the pathogenesis of their subject's clinical phenotype of complete androgen insensitivity, partly in view of the mutant's 4%-8% residual transactivational capacity as observed with the MMTV-CAT system. In contrast, we found normal levels of AR mRNA in the cells of subjects with either Arg773 mutation, and Arg773His produces complete androgen insensitivity while disturbing the androgen-binding function of the AR much less than does Arg773Cys. The AR needs Arg773 to support augmentation (up-regulation) of androgen-binding activity in normal genital skin fibroblasts during extended incubation with androgen (Kaufman et al. 1983; Gottlieb et al. 1987). The fact that prolonged androgen exposure  Prior et al.  152  DHT  MB "  MT  M  QL ._: ._o  CD  0(i ' e)  C  E C  0)a) CD~ 0 X  -a) c  o0  Q-  0  50  0  50 100 150 0 Time (min) at 340C  150 0  100  50  100  150  Figure I 0 Rates of dissociation, and 340C, of MB-, DHT- and MT-receptor complexes formed in COS-1 cells transfected with pSVhAR (unblackened symbols) or pSVhAR.Arg773His (blackened symbols). In other experiments, the slower rate of dissociation of mutant MT-receptor complexes at 340C permitted observations at several time points that were perfectly coordinate with the single one shown here.  augments androgen binding in COS-1 cells containing a normal hAR cDNA controlled by the SV40 early promoter affirms the view (Krongrad et al. 1991) that the mechanism is posttranscriptional, very probably by AR stabilization. Indeed, the loss of binding observed, under replicate conditions, when Arg773His is transfected instead indicates, in contrast, that formation of mutant A-R complexes destabilizes the AR. In this light, the intrinsic transregulatory competence of mutants such as Arg773His will only be measurable  by systems of cotransfection or in vitro transcription that nullify-or, at least, weigh the complication ofmutant A-R complex instability. Both codon 773 mutations described here involved G:C-A:T transitions. This coincides with the propensity of cytosines at CpG dinucleotides to methylate and to spontaneously deaminate to thymines (Barker et al. 1984).

Indeed, of all such mutations known, Arg773Cys has been among the earliest to be reported from the United States (Brown et al. 1990; Tilley et al. 1990), France (Mebarki et al. 1990), and Canada (Trifiro et al. 1989). Somatic and germinal mosaicism for single-gene mutations in humans has become well documented recently, thanks to the tools of molecular genetics. For X-linked disorders, affected males and females have been recognized (Maddalena et al. 1988; Gitschier et al. 1989; Bakker et al. 1989). The mother of family 1 must be a somatic-germinal mosaic, because her peripheral lymphocyte DNA does not carry the Arg773Cys mutation, although she had two 46,XY daughters affected with it. Since her sister's menarche was delayed to age 18 years, which occasionally is a sign of heterozygosity due to random X-chromosome inactivation, it is probable that she herself was a heterozygous zygote whose mutant gene back-mutated (reverted) to the normal allele. Unfortunately, we were not permitted to prove this. Note added in proof. - We have discovered that the transfected Arg773Cys AR is thermostable at 370C in the absence of androgen and that its thermolability at 370C in the presence of androgen is reversible at 220C.

"1","AMP deaminase (AMPD; EC 3.5.4.6) is encoded by a multigene family in mammals. The AMPD1 gene is expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle, where this enzyme is thought to play an important role in energy metabolism. Deficiency of AMPD activity in skeletal muscle is associated with symptoms of a metabolic myopathy. Eleven unrelated individuals with AMPD deficiency were studied, and each was shown to be homozygous for a mutant allele characterized by a C----T transition at nucleotide 34 (codon 12 in exon 2) and at nucleotide 143 (codon 48 in exon 3). The C----T transition at codon 12 results in a nonsense mutation predicting a severely truncated AMPD peptide. Consistent with this prediction, no immunoreactive AMPD1 peptide is detectable in skeletal muscle of these patients. This mutant allele is found in 12% of Caucasians and 19% of African-Americans, whereas none of the 106 Japanese subjects surveyed has this mutant allele. We conclude from these studies that this mutant allele is present at a sufficiently high frequency to account for the 2% reported incidence of AMPD deficiency in muscle biopsies. The restricted distribution and high frequency of this doubly mutated allele suggest it arose in a remote ancestor of individuals of Western European descent.Molecular basis of AMP deaminase deficiency in skeletal muscle.Proc.

Wyngaarden, April 9, 1992  inherited defect in the AMPDJ gene since the enzyme deficiency has been reported in several members of the same family (13, 20). However, acquired deficiency of AMPD has also been described (14), raising the possibility that the absence of AMPD activity may be secondary to other abnormalities. To determine the molecular basis for this potentially common abnormality we have studied 11 unrelated individuals with AMPD deficiency. All of these individuals are homozygous for the same mutant allele. In randomly selected Caucasians and African-Americans we have found this mutant allele in 13% of 144 alleles tested, but we have not found this mutant allele in 106 DNA samples from Japanese subjects.  AMP deaminase (AMPD; EC 3.5.4.6) is enABSTRACT coded by a multigene family in mammals. The AMPDI gene is expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle, where this enzyme is thought to play an important role in energy metabolism. Deficiency of AMPD activity in skeletal muscle is associated with symptoms of a metabolic myopathy. Eleven unrelated individuals with AMPD deficiency were studied, and each was shown to be homozygous for a mutant allele characterized by a C -. T transition at nucleotide 34 (codon 12 in exon 2) and at nucleotide 143 (codon 48 in exon 3). The C -* T transition at codon 12 results in a nonsense mutation predicting a severely truncated AMPD peptide. Consistent with this prediction, no immunoreactive AMPD1 peptide is detectable in skeletal muscle of these patients. This mutant allele is found in 12% of Caucasians and 19% of African-Americans, whereas none of the 106 Japanese subjects surveyed has this mutant allele. We conclude from these studies that this mutant allele is present at a sufficiently high frequency to account for the 2% reported incidence of AMPD deficiency in muscle biopsies. The restricted distribution and high frequency of this doubly mutated allele suggest it arose in a remote ancestor of individuals of Western European descent.  METHODS AND MATERIALS Patients. The index case for these studies is an 18-year-old German female, who first noted calf pain at 4 years of age, usually related to exercise. Persistence of these symptoms along with weakness of the upper arms eventually led to a muscle biopsy, which exhibited absence of AMPD activity with normal phosphorylase and phosphofructokinase activities. This patient's muscle biopsy, as well as DNA samples from other family members, was studied in detail. Muscle biopsies or DNA samples from 10 other unrelated individuals with AMPD deficiency and variable symptoms (Table 1) were also analyzed. All patients were identified and referred to us because muscle biopsies performed for the indicated symptoms (Table 1) were found to have reduced levels of AMPD activity. DNA samples from 59 Caucasians, 13 AfricanAmericans, and 106 Japanese were obtained from normal volunteers or from investigators who had no knowledge of the donors' medical history. Protein Analyses. AMPD activity was quantified either by a radiochemical assay or by a spectrophotometric assay (5), and the method employed is noted in the text or figure legend. Immunoblots were performed with antiserum raised to AMPD purified from rat skeletal muscle (5) using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham). Nucleic Acid Analyses. Northern hybridization of RNA extracted from skeletal muscle was performed as described from this laboratory (3). First-strand cDNA (22) was synthesized from patient-derived RNA samples using an oligonucleotide complementary to bases 2239-2258 (5'-TTGGTTTACTTTTTTTTATTC-3') in this 2.3-kilobase (kb) mRNA (the sequence of human AMPD is reported in ref. 23). Single-strand cDNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (24, 25) in two separate reactions; oligonucleotides corresponding to bases -20 to -1 (5'-AATCAAGGATCCCAGCAACA-3') and 881-900 (5'-CACCTTCCTGCAGTTATAAA-3') were used to synthesize the 5' region;  AMP deaminase (AMPD; EC 3.5.4.6), an enzyme that catalyzes deamination of AMP to IMP, and the purine nucleotide cycle, of which AMPD is one component, play a central role in purine nucleotide interconversion in eukaryotic cells. As a consequence, AMPD activity can be a determinant of adenylate energy charge and energy metabolism in the cell (1, 2). In mammals, AMPD is encoded by a multigene family (3), which accounts in part for the tissue-specific and stagespecific isoforms of AMPD that have been identified (4, 5). The activity of AMPD in skeletal muscle is -100 times higher than that of other organs, a consequence of the high level of expression of the AMPDJ gene in this tissue (1, 4, 5). Since Fishbein et al. (6) first reported 5 patients with AMPD deficiency, >100 patients with this enzyme defect have been described (7-21). Several centers have reported AMPD deficiency in up to 2% of randomly selected muscle biopsies (6, 7, 9, 12). A review of reported cases of AMPD deficiency noted that 88% of these individuals with AMPD deficiency describe exercise-related symptoms, including muscle aches, cramps, and early fatigue (1). Symptoms are variable, however, with some reports of asymptomatic individuals and descriptions of other patients who exhibit a range of neuromuscular disorders. In the few patients studied in detail (6, 17, 18), the deficiency of AMPD activity has been restricted to skeletal muscle, consistent with high-level expression of the AMPD1 gene being restricted to skeletal muscle (3, 4). The molecular basis for AMPD deficiency is not known, but in some individuals it is presumed to be the result of an  Abbreviation: AMPD, AMP deaminase.

This approach was selected to reduce the probability of errors induced by PCR of long DNA sequences (26) and to facilitate functional analysis of individual mutations that might be found in the 5' and 3' regions of this transcript. PCR products were subcloned into pBS (Stratagene) for sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide chaintermination method (27). Thirty independently isolated pBS subclones were pooled for initial sequencing to obviate PCR-induced errors. Mutations identified by this screening procedure were subsequently confirmed by sequencing this region in individual clones. The PCR products were also subcloned into a prokaryotic vector, pKK233-2 (Pharmacia), for expression in Escherichia coli. This approach permits a rapid functional analysis of mutations since prokaryotes do not exhibit AMPD activity. Genomic DNA, isolated from patients and volunteers by standard methods (22), was amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides corresponding to intron 1 and intron 2 (5'-GCAATCTACATGTGTCTACC-3') and 5'-ATAGCCATGTTTCTGAATTA-3') for evaluation of exon 2; oligonucleotides corresponding to intron 2 and intron 3 (5'-AGCAGAAACTCTCAGCTGAC-3' and 5'-CTCCTTAGGTGCCAATATAC-3') were used for evaluation of exon 3. These PCR products were analyzed by direct sequencing (28), hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides (29), and/or restriction analysis as described in the text.  RESULTS Evaluation of Index Family. AMPD1 transcript size is not detectably altered in skeletal muscle from the index patient, and transcript abundance is not reduced (Fig. 1). To the contrary, the AMPD1 transcript, when normalized to creatine kinase M abundance, is approximately three times greater in this patient than a normal control. Studies of a heterozygote for AMPD deficiency also demonstrate that the mutant AMPD1 transcript is present in greater abundance than the wild-type transcript (unpublished observations). Comparison ofthe cDNA sequence for the index patient to that for a normal control reveals only two nucleotide differences (Fig. 2). Numbering from the first in-frame AUG, the presumptive translation start site, nucleotide 34 is a T in the patient and it is a C in the control; nucleotide 143 is a T in the patient and it is a C in the control. The deviation in sequence of the patient cDNA at position 34 (exon 2) changes this codon from CAA to TAA-i.e., a stop codon instead of glutamine. The sequence difference at position 143 (exon 3) in the patient predicts an amino acid substitution of a leucine for proline.  To evaluate the significance of the missense mutation at position 143, wild-type and mutant cDNAs were ligated into a prokaryotic expression vector (pKK233-2) and E. coli lysates were assayed for AMPD activity. The 5' terminal 133 nucleotides of the mutant cDNA were replaced with the wild-type sequence to remove the nonsense mutation at position 34, resulting in a cDNA that had the single C -+ T mutation at position 143. Prokaryotes do not exhibit detectable AMPD activity and any activity in the lysate from E. coli transformed with the expression vector is presumably derived from the plasmid introduced into E. coli. This was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of the AMPD activity using an antiserum specific for the AMPDJ gene product (5). E. coli transformed with the wild-type cDNA exhibit AMPD activity in the range of 2-8 munits/mg of protein, and the AMPD activity in lysates from E. coli transformed with the cDNA mutated only at position 143 is not detectably different.  Although the mutation at position 143 appears to have little effect on catalytic activity of AMPD, the nonsense mutation at position 34 in this patient would be expected to give rise to a severely truncated peptide, only 11 amino acid residues compared to 747 residues in the control. Muscle extract from this patient has no detectable immunoreactive AMPD using polyclonal antiserum, whereas an easily detectable 86-kDa band is visualized in muscle extract from the normal control using this antiserum (Fig. 3). Deletion and point mutation analyses of human AMPD1 have shown that the active site for catalysis in this enzyme is located 3' to nucleotide 531, codon 177 (unpublished observation). Thus, the nonsense mutation at position 34 would be expected to result in complete loss of AMPD activity, and the absence of immunoreactive protein can also be explained by this mutation.

After washing the filter, the same filter was used for hybridization with a human creatine kinase M (CK-M) cDNA probe (30).  Medical Sciences: Morisaki et al.  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Studies of Other Patients with AMPD Deficiency. Muscle from 1 of the 10 other unrelated individuals with AMPD deficiency was used to prepare cDNA as in the index case and this cDNA was sequenced in its entirety. Genomic DNA from all 11 AMPD-deficient subjects was sequenced in the regions of exon 2 and 3. The only deviations from the control sequence  are  C  -.  T transitions at  positions  34 and 143  (Table  2). The AMPD activity levels in skeletal muscle and the symptoms in each of these individuals are listed in Table 1. An immunoblot of muscle lysate from one of these individuals confirmed the absence of immunoreactive AMPD peptide in this patient. Muscle was also available from one heterozygous individual and cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription PCR as described above. Sequencing of individual subclones of the PCR products prepared from this individual demonstrated Ct Pt  that the C  -*  T transitions at  FIG. 3. Immunoreactive AMPD peptide in muscle lysate.

Population Studies. Genomic DNA obtained from 59 Caucasians, 13 African-Americans, and 106 Japanese was analyzed by two techniques for the nonsense mutation at position 34 (Fig. 5). PCR-amplified DNA from all subjects was immobilized on Nytran filters and hybridized to a wild-type or a mutant oligonucleotide for distinguishing the two types of alleles (29). PCR-amplified DNA was also restricted with Mae II in 31 subjects. This restriction enzyme recognizes the sequence ACGT, found only once in this region of the normal AMPD1 gene. The mutation at position 34 alters the sequence of this restriction site, and the PCR product from the mutant allele (AIGT) is not a substrate for this restriction endonuclease. Both tests give identical results in all cases. Seventeen percent of Caucasians and 23% of African-Americans are heterozygous for the nonsense mutation in exon 2, whereas none of the Japanese examined have this mutant allele. In addition, two Caucasians and one African-American were found to be homozygous for this mutation. Each of these individuals with the exon 2 nonsense mutation also has a C T transition at position 143 of exon 3. Not one of the 34 chromosomes analyzed with a C at position 34 has a T at position 143. Thus, in the 74 chromosomes examined, there is no evidence for disconcordance between a C at positions 34 and 143 or a T at both of these positions. on  DISCUSSION Eleven unrelated individuals with AMPD deficiency were evaluated in this study, and both alleles of the AMPDJ gene have the same two mutations in all 11 individuals-i.e., a C -+  T transition at  positions  34 and 143. The C  --  T transition  at position 34, in exon 2, results in a nonsense mutation that  predicts a severely truncated peptide as the product of this mutant transcript. This truncated peptide terminates prior to the synthesis of the catalytic domain of AMPD, providing an explanation for the significant decrease of this enzyme activity in these individuals. Either this truncated peptide is not  6460  ~\'l~ ~ ~I  Medical Sciences: Morisaki et al. lF\(oll 2 I11. 1 RU() i  It (.  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 (1992) 1 34I )II  d1.i)}.

PCR-amplified genomic DNA from the region of exon 2 of AMPD1 was fixed to Nytran paper and hybridized to a radiolabeled wild-type oligonucleotide (Oligo 1; 5'-ATACTCAC-jTTTCTCTTCAG-3') or a radiolabeled mutant oligonucleotide (Oligo 2; 5'-ATACTCACATTTCTCTTCAG-3'). DNA from an individual homozygous for a C at nucleotide 34 (Homo C/C) hybridizes only to oligonucleotide 1, DNA from an individual homozygous for a T at nucleotide 34 (Homo T/T) hybridizes only to oligonucleotide 2, and DNA from a heterozygote (Hetero C/T) hybridizes to both oligonucleotides. (B) Restriction endonuclease mapping. PCR-amplified genomic DNA from the region of exon 2 was digested with Mae II. This enzyme recognizes the sequence ACGT that occurs once in the wild-type PCR fragment, but it is absent from the mutant PCR fragment as consequence of the C -. T transition in exon 2. The undigested PCR fragment is 198 nucleotides in length; the digested PCR fragments are 111 and 87 nucleotides in length. Abbreviations for homozygote and heterozygote are the same as in A. bp, Base pairs.  tors (14, 31). We assume as they do that most of this residual activity reflects AMPD produced in nonmyocytes in the muscle tissue by one of the other AMPD genes since this activity is not reactive with antisera specific for the AMPD1 gene product (14, 31). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that a small fraction of the residual activity is produced in myocytes from the mutant AMPDJ gene as a consequence of alternative splicing (see below). The C -b T transition at nucleotide 143 in the AMPD1 transcript of these patients is apparently a silent mutation based on studies performed with recombinant peptides produced in a prokaryotic expression system. Although detailed kinetic studies have not been carried out with the wild-type and mutant peptides, which differ by only a proline or a leucine at codon 48, these two enzymes have comparable activity under the assay conditions employed. The apparent normal catalytic activity exhibited by the AMPD peptide harboring a mutation in codon 48 could assume clinical importance, if future studies demonstrate the human AMPD1 transcript is subject to alternative splicing, which deletes exon 2. In rat, exon 2 is deleted from the majority of transcripts produced from the AMPDJ gene in embryonic muscle (32) and in response to changes in neural innervation of skeletal muscle (unpublished observations). Since the primary sequence of the AMPDJ gene has been highly conserved in man and rat (23), a similar pattern of alternative splicing may occur in embryonic human muscle or in response to external signals. Alternative splicing of exon 2 in the human AMPD1 transcript would delete the nonsense mutation specified by the C -* T transition at nucleotide 34.  Medical Sciences: Morisaki  et  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 (1992)  al.  Although we have not detected alternative splicing in adult human skeletal muscle (33), we cannot exclude at this time the possibility that it may occur at an early stage of skeletal muscle development, thereby ameliorating the consequences of the nonsense mutation in exon 2. The absence of a C -- T transition at nucleotide 143 in the 34 normal chromosomes examined makes it unlikely that this mutation is a common polymorphism in these populations. This fact, coupled with the 100%6 concordance of C -- T transitions at nucleotides 34 and 143 in 40 chromosomes analyzed from AMPD-deficient subjects and heterozygotes, suggests one of two explanations. Either there is a significant rate of spontaneous and coordinated mutation at both of these positions or the doubly mutated allele is present at a relatively high frequency in some populations. The latter explanation seems more plausible since it is difficult to envision a mechanism that results in spontaneous mutations affecting the same two nucleotides in all of these alleles. Furthermore, this mechanism would have to be restricted to certain populations since the doubly mutated allele has not been observed in the Japanese population. A more plausible explanation in our opinion is that the doubly mutated allele arose at some time in the remote past, and it has become widely disseminated in individuals of Western European descent. Studies are necessary to compare the frequency of this mutant allele in different ethnic groups in Western Europe, as well as African-Americans and native Africans, to gain additional insight into the origin of this allele. The high frequency of this allele in some populations may prove useful in studying the relationship between different ethnic groups. Recognizing that the frequency of AMPD heterozygosity is -20% in Caucasians and African-Americans, it is not surprising that several centers have reported 1-3% of randomly sampled muscle biopsies are deficient in this enzyme activity (6, 7, 9, 12). Clearly 1-3% of individuals in these populations do not have symptoms that are clinically severe enough to be classified as a metabolic myopathy. Thus, the frequency of this mutant allele in these populations raises a number of questions about the clinical implications of this form of AMPD deficiency. One could conclude this mutant allele is a harmless polymorphism. On the other hand, this mutation could be compensated for in some tissues or at some stages of development by removal of exon 2 through alternative splicing. The residual AMPD activity observed in muscle tissue of these patients, presumably a product of another member of this multigene family (3, 14, 31), might also compensate for the mutation in the AMPDJ gene, especially if this activity were present in myocytes. Other interpretations include the possibility that clinically significant myopathic symptoms develop only in individuals who have another inherited or acquired abnormality in energy metabolism. Answers to these questions will require additional physiological and molecular studies in controls and individuals with this mutant allele. T.M., M.G., and H.M. contributed equally to this report.

The molecular defect responsible for a case of mild osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) with repeated femural fractures was investigated. The proband and his mother, who presented minor OI signs but no bone fractures, were shown to produce normal and abnormal type-I procollagen molecules in their dermal fibroblasts. The molecular defect was localized in about half of the proband's pro a l ( I ) m R N A molecules by chemical cleavage with piperidine of hydroxylamine-reacted m R N A : cDNA heteroduplexes. The corresponding region was reversetranscribed and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cloning and sequencing of the amplified products revealed in both subjects a G-to-A transition in the first base of codon 901 of the ~l(I) triple helical domain, which led to a serine for glycine substitution. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to amplified genomic D N A from fibroblasts and leukocytes confirmed the heterozygous nature of both patients and proved the absence of mosaicism. The presence of the mutation was excluded in other healthy family members, who were reported to have bluish sclerae. The mild phenotypic outcome of this newly characterized mutation contradicts previous findings on glycine substitutions in the C-terminal region of collagen triple helix, most of which caused lethal OI.  Introduction The molecular biology of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) has been elucidated through the characterization of many (more than 80 to date) different mutations in the type-I procollagen structural genes ( C O L I A 1 and COL1A2; for a review see Kuivaniemi et al. 1991). Mutations that Correspondence to: M. Mottes  affect quantitatively the production of type-I collagen are responsible for the mildest form of OI (OI type I according to Sillence et al. 1979). On the other hand, point mutations, splicing mutations, deletions, and insertions, which produce qualitatively abnormal collagen molecules, have been found to be the cause of a wider range of clinical forms. Point mutations that resulted in substitutions for glycine residues in the triple helical domain were found in several lethal cases, as well as in severe (OI type III) and also in a few mild/moderate cases (Byers et al. 1991; Kuivaniemi et al. 1991). Most of the authors have suggested a position-dependent effect of glycine substitutions within chains. So far this has been widely confirmed for glycine to cysteine substitutions in pro a l ( I ) chains (Starman et al. 1989). The most intriguing exceptions to the "phenotypic gradient" model are represented by the Gly-Ser substitutions mapped in the COL1A1 gene: serine substitutions at position 565 (Bateman et al. 1991) as well as 598 and 631 (Westerhausen et al. 1990) caused lethal phenotypes. A Ser-832 substitution was found in a moderate (OI type IV) case (Marini et al. 1989) while a Ser-844 substitution caused severe (type Ill) OI (Pack et' al. 1989). More Cterminal substitutions, Ser-913, 1003, and 1009, caused lethal, lethal, and extremely severe phenotypes, respectively (Cohn et al. 1990a). Here we present the molecular evidence for a new Gly- Ser substitution at position 901, which is caused by a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 3235 of the coding sequence of a pro a l ( I ) gene (COLIA1). This mutation was found in an 8-year-old boy affected with mild OI and, most strikingly, in his mother, who showed only mild features of the disease, but never suffered bone fractures. Our data indicate that a particular combination of nature and position of the substituting amino acid can play a crucial role in determining the phenotypic outcome.  481  Materials and methods  Clinical summary Clinical information on the family has been reported in a previous paper (Tenni et al. 1991). Briefly, the patient, now an 8-year-old boy, has been diagnosed as OI type IB. Due to repeated femoral bilateral fractures, he underwent intramedullar rodding at the age of 3. Since then the number of fractures has greatly reduced and he can walk without assistance. No hearing impairment has been detected so far. His mother, now 52, never reported bone fractures and, despite her very short stature (140 cm), she does not show any particular dysmorphism. Around age 40 she started showing mild hypoacusia and moderate osteoporosis. She was 44 at the time of the proband's pregnancy, she had never undergone any medical treatment, nor did she know she had a heritable connective tissue disorder. At the age of 48 she bore a second healthy son, who shows a bluish hue of the sclerae. This trait has been reported also in other maternal relatives, besides the proband and his mother, who do not show any other particular feature. A maternal uncle and his three sons were included in the molecular investigation with allele-specific oligonucleotides. Skin biopsies from the proband, parents, and controls were obtained after informed consent.  Detection of the mutation on R N A by chemical cleavage Cultures of skin fibroblasts were established and grown as reported (Tenni et al. 1990) and were used between the 3rd and the 15th passage. Total RNA was prepared from the patient's fibroblasts by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method. A normal eDNA probe corresponding to the C terminal region of proctl(I) chains (amino acid residues 822-1275; amino acid positions are conventionally numbered by assigning number l to the first glycine of the triple helical domain of ct chains) was obtained from a full-length al(I) cDNA (Tromp et al. 1988) after digestion with NcoI and EcoRI. The resulting 1365-bp fragment was 3' end-labeled with [a32P] dCTP and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Boehringer). Approximately 10ng (3 x 105 cpm) of the double-stranded probe was mixed with 10 gg of total RNA. Denaturation was performed at 80~ for 10min in the buffer described previously (Lamande et al. 1989). Heteroduplex formation occurred during a subsequent 2-h incubation at 55~ Hydroxylamine and piperidine incubations were performed as previously reported (Valli et al. 1991).  Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybrid&ation Genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples and cultured dermal fibroblasts was prepared according to standard methods. A 500-ng sample was amplified by PCR using 20 pmol each of primers CDC22 (complementary to exon 44) and CDC26 (complementary to intron 45), the generous gift of C.D. Constantinou (Constantinou et al. 1990). Amplification was performed for 30 cycles consisting of denaturation (1 min at 94~ annealing (30 s at 52~ primer extension (45 s at 72~ with Perkin Elmer-Cetus Taq polymerase and buffer in the presence of 0.25 mM spermidine. Approximately 200 ng of the 571-bp product was ethanol precipitated, resuspended in 33% formaldehyde, boiled for 4 min, and immediately dot blotted on Hybond C (Amersham) duplicate filters. Allele-specific oligonucleotides carrying either the normal (N): 5'GGTCCTGTCGGCCCTGTTG 3', or the mutant (M): 5'GGTCCTGTCAGCCCTGTTG 3' sequence, were synthesized and end-labeled by [7-32P] ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Pharmacia). Hybridization was carried out overnight at 52~ individual filters were rinsed briefly at room temperature with 6 x SSC, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and then at 59~ for 10min. For the quantitation assay, serial twofold dilutions of amplified genomic DNA (from 100 ng to 12.5 ng) were dot blotted and hybridized as described above. The labeled N and M allelespecific oligonucleotides had comparable specific activities: 3.2 x 108 cpm/gg and 3.0 • 108 cpm/lag, respectively. After autoradiography, individual radioactive dots were excised from nitrocellulose filters and counted. Oligonucleotides and primers were prepared on a 391 Applied Biosystem DNA synthetizer.  Results A n 8-year-old b o y with r e p e a t e d f e m o r a l bilateral fractures a n d his m o t h e r , p r e s e n t i n g n o fractures, mild hypoacusia, a n d osteoporosis, were i n v e s t g a t e d in o r d e r to identify the genetic defect. Collagens type I f r o m fibroblast cultures d e r i v e d from skin biopsies were s t u d i e d ( T e n n i et al. 1991). O n the basis of the b i o c h e m i c a l data, the p r e s e n c e of a p o i n t m u t a t i o n l e a d i n g to a glycine s u b s t i t u t i o n in the  c D NA synthes& and amplification First strand eDNA was synthesized from 5 gg of total RNA with reverse transcriptase (BRL) and 100 pmol of the oligonucleotide primer: 5'CATCATCAGCCCGGTAGTAGCGGC 3', complementary to nucleotides 3638-3661 of the ct 1(I) eDNA sequence. One-tenth of the reaction mixture was used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification through 25 cycles using Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer-Cetus). Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 94~ for 1 min, annealing at 60~ for I min, and primer extension at 72~ for 1 min. The second PCR primer: 5'GGTGAACCTGGCAAACAAGG 3' (corresponding to nucleotides 2940-2959) was deduced from the work of Lamande et al. 1989. The amplification mixture contained 40pmol of each primer and 4mM MgCI2. The expected PCR product of 721 bp was visualized on a 1% agarose gel.  Sequence determination of cloned cDNAs For sequence determination, PCR products were incubated with Sau3A, and a 468-bp fragment was recovered from 2% Nusieve (FMC) agarose and ligated to SmaI-linearized pUC19 plasmid vector. Several independent clones were isolated and sequenced using the Sequenase version 2.0 kit (US Biochemical Corp.)  Fig. 1. Mismatch analysis on mRNA :cDNA heteroduplexes. Total RNA from the proband's (P) and control (C) fibroblasts was hybridized to a 1365-bp fragment of al(I) cDNA. Heteroduplexes were reacted with hydroxylamine for the time indicated and subsequently treated with piperidine. Cleavage products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel and autoradiography. Sizes (in nt) of the fragments are indicated. The MW standard was a 32p-labeled 0X174 DNA digested with HaeIII (not shown)  482  Fig.2.

The sense strand sequence is shown: arrows point to the A-for-G substitution. The DNA sequence surrounding the mutation site is shown below  CB6 peptide of ~1(I) chains was suspected. The corresponding m R N A region was therefore subjected to molecular investigation by the chemical cleavage method. Heteroduplexes were formed between the patient's or control's m R N A and a wild-type c D N A probe. Subsequent treatment with hydroxylamine and piperidine produced a 240 + 5 bp fragment that was released from the 1365-bp p r o b e (Fig. 1). The same mismatch was found within the mother's m R N A (data not shown). The patient's and mother's m R N A s were reversetranscribed and amplified in vitro using a couple of oligonucleotide primers that had been designed to cover the whole CB6 peptide coding region, from amino acid 802 to amino acid 1042. On the basis of the chemical cleavage localization, sequence determination was restricted to only a portion of amplified D N A (468bp, nt 3193-3661) obtained after Sau3A digestion and cloning of the original P C R product (721bp). Several individual clones were isolated, and six clones for each subject were sequenced. For the proband, three of six clones showed a G - t o - A transition at nucleotide 3235 of the pro ~ l ( I ) gene sequence, which would lead triplet 901 in the triple helix to code for serine, instead of glycine. For his mother, two of six clones showed the same base substitution (Fig. 2). Other discrepancies with the published sequence (Bernard et al. 1983) were ascribed to errors in the original report. In all twelve clones sequenced, triplets 899 and 902 were C C T instead of CCC; and triplet 903 was G T T (Val), instead of G C T (Ala); as found also by L a m a n d e et al. (1989) and Constantinou et al. (1990).  Fig. 3. Pedigree and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization of the family members. Asterisks indicate healthy individuals with bluish sclerae.

Only the proband and his mother were found to carry the Ser901 mutation, while the other family m e m b e r s examined were negative (Fig. 3).  Inheritance o f the mutation in the proband's family  In the clinical history of the family, the presence of blue sclerae had been reported, not only in the proband and in his mother, but also in family m e m b e r s who did not show any other OI sign.  Quantitation of mutant-to-normal allele ratio in the mother"  We investigated the possibility that somatic mosaicism might account for the very mild maternal O I phenotype. For this purpose quantification of allele-specific oligonuc-  483 leotide hybridizations was performed on equal amounts of amplified genomic DNA from different tissues (as estimated by fluorescence on an ethidium bromide stained agarose gel). The results reported in Table 1 indicate a 1 : 1 ratio of mutant-to-normal allele in all the tissues examined; therefore, no cellular mosaicism was detected in two of the mother's tissues.  Discussion  The data presented here provide the molecular evidence for a new COLIA1 mutation, Ser-901, which causes mild OI in a young patient and subclinical OI in his mother. The clinical phenotype was originally classified as OI type IB (Tenni et al. 1991). The blue sclerae and mild hypoacusia meet Sillence's (Sillence et al. 1979) criteria for OI type I, while the presence of dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI) and short stature, although not accompanied by bone deformities, are compatible with OI type IV. Based on the recent literature (Byers et al. 1991), it appears that the most common OI phenotype with blue sclerae and normal stature is classifiable as type I and attributable to quantitative defects in COL1A1, while other mild/moderate phenotypes, due to structural defects, are more commonly classified as type IV. We believe that our patients may better belong to this second group. As reported for other glycine substitutions, in this case a G-to-A transition occurring at a CpG dinucleotide is responsible for the disease. Mutations at CpG dinucleotides are found commonly in a variety of human genetic diseases (Cooper and Youssoufian 1988), and they have been found in two COL1A1 recurrent substitutions. This notwithstanding, CpG dinucleotides do not appear as preferential mutation sites in COL1A1 (Pruchno et al. 1991). A more precise indication of the biological relevance of CpG dinucleotide mutations in the collagen genes, will be provided in the future by the delineation of a close-to-saturation map of mutations. This serine-for-glycine substitution falls within the CB6 peptide of the ~1(I) chain: the majority of glycine substitutions so far mapped in this region were incompatible with life. The only three viable exceptions are represented by the already mentioned Ser-832 substitution (OI type IV), the Ser-844, and Ser-1009 substitutions (OI type III). In our case, a Ser-901 substitution results in a much milder form of the disease. The idea that serine, due to its small and polar side chain and its ability to form hydrogen bonds, can somehow be accommodated in an axial position of the triple helix is an appealing one. Maybe serine is more easily tolerated in some (but not all) axial positions than other bulkier residues and, in these circumstances, it exerts a less destructive effect on collagen fibril performance. Another important issue about different amino acid substitutions within collagen is the effect on triple helix stability. The serine substitution at position 598 altered the thermal unfolding of abnormal molecules (20~ as compared to the normal melting temperature, Tm = 40~176 while Ser-631, Ser-832, and Ser-844 sub-  stitutions did not cause any substantial change in the Tm of abnormal collagen chains. The different thermal stabilities of the mutated collagens led to the conclusion that thermal unfolding of the protein is not fully cooperative, but is accomplished through the micro-unfolding of a series of independent "cooperative blocks" (Westerhausen et al. 1990). Previous biochemical studies on this family (Tenni et al. 1991) revealed a Tm of 37~ (4~176 lower than normal) of the defective molecules. Interestingly in the nearest COOH terminal glycine substitution mapped, Cys-904 (OI type II), the abnormal molecules had a similar Tm (37~ Constantinou et al. 1989). It is possible, according to the microunfolding model, that the region around the 901 and 904 positions contributes more than others to the general stability of the helix. According to the B~ichinger model (B~chinger et al. 1992), Gly-901 an Gly-904 lie in a region of high relative stability, flanked by regions of lower stability. The model could therefore explain the low melting temperature of both mutants, as well as justify the high degree of overmodification due to the difficult renucleation downstream to the mutation. Pulse labeling experiments indicated a slower secretion of overmodified procollagen molecules in the proband and his mother, and demonstrated that the secretion of normal chains was also decreased (70%-90% of controls). The mutant collagen molecules were able to copolymerize with normal ones and be deposited in the matrix formed by cultured dermal fibroblasts in the presence of dextran sulfate (M. Valli et al., in preparation). The ratio of mutant-to-normal primers in the matrix was about 30%, which is lower than the expected ratio of 75% ; therefore, normal molecules were preferentially laid down. The decreased procollagen secretion shown by our patients, as well as by the patient Cys-904, could depend on the location of the mutation. The integrity of the subdomain in which both mutations fall could play a crucial role in type-I procollagen secretion. The impairment of procollagen secretion and the decreased stability of the triple helix led to a diminished amount of type-I collagen available in the extracellular matrix for fibril formation. We can speculate that the disturbance caused by a serine substitution in the region around amino acid 900 does not impair, as other substitutions do, the performance of collagen fibrils that contain abnormal molecules in a percentage lower than that synthesized by the cell. While we demonstrated that the proband inherited the mutation from his mother, we considered the possibility of her being a mosaic due to a new mutation that occurred during early stages in her development, which might explain her subclinical phenotype. The data on leukocytes and fibroblasts do not reveal any difference between mother and son; therefore, no evidence of mosaicism was found. A limitation to this conclusion is that we could not determine the ratio of mutant-to-normal allele in other maternal tissues, such as osteoblasts. The clinical heterogeneity between the two relatives, anyhow, is not as striking as in the other documented cases of intrafamilial variability due to somatic mosaicism, where very mild and lethal phenotypes coexisted (Wallis  484 et al. 1990; C o h n et al. 1990b; E d w a r d s et al. 1990; C o n s t a n t i n o u et al. 1990).

"1","345  Clinical Investigation Differences in Clinical Expression of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Associated With Two Distinct Mutations in the /3-Myosin Heavy Chain Gene A 908Leu--Val Mutation and  a  403Arg-gGln Mutation  Neal D. Epstein, MD; Gabriel M. Cohn, MD; Francis Cyran, BS; and Lameh Fananapazir, MD, MRCP Background. The disease gene for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been identified as the f-myosin heavy chain (fj-MHC) gene in some HCM families. We describe extensive clinical evaluations in two kindreds with two distinct point mutations in the f-MHC gene. Methods and Result. We used single-strand confirmation polymorphism (SSCP) gel analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified products capturing each of the 40 f-MHC gene exons to identify distinct missense mutations in two HCM kindreds. Clinical, ECG, and echocardiographic studies were performed in the two A1vaI mutation and kindred 2002 with amino acid 403`9`JB kindreds: kindred 2755 with amino acid 908 mutation. The morphological appearances of HCM were similar in these two kindreds. However, the two kindreds differed with respect to disease penetrance, age of onset of disease, and incidence of premature sudden death. Twelve of 31 adults (>17 years) with the disease gene in kindred 2755 did not have left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and only five of these had ECG abnormalities. Thus, the disease penetrance in adults with this mutation was only 61%. None of 11 children aged <16 years had LVH. The 908 mutation was associated with a low incidence of cardiac events: Only two sudden deaths and one syncope occurred in 46 individuals with the mutant allele. In contrast, LVH was present in all 11 adults in kindred 2002 with the 403 mutation (100% disease penetrance). In addition, three of four affected children were symptomatic and had clinical evidence of HCM. The disease in this kindred was severe and resulted in six premature sudden deaths. Seven additional patients had syncope or presyncope. Conclsions. In some kindreds, the HCM disease gene is more prevalent than indicated by echocardiography and ECG. Some point mutations may be associated with a more malignant prognosis. Preclinical identification of children with mutations associated with a high incidence of sudden death and syncope provides the opportunity to evaluate efficacy of early therapeutic interventions.

Linkage analysis has shown that in less than half of the kindreds, a disease gene is localized on chromosome 14q.1-3 In these studies involving a total of nine kindreds, each evaluated separately for linkage, four have shown either tight linkage or a mutation in the ,B-myosin heavy chain (,-BMHC) gene on chromosome 14q. In the remaining five, this locus has been excluded as the site of the disease gene.1-3 Thus, nonallelic genetic heterogeneity of HCM has been established.

Kindred 2002. There was previous evidence of linkage of the disease phenotype to the f3-MHC gene on chromosome 14 in this kindred as well (LOD score, 2.5 with no recombinations). An expanded pedigree of 21 individuals is depicted in Figure 2. Five patients who were not examined at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) died suddenly, and the diagnosis of HCM had been made elsewhere before death or at autopsy. The remaining 15 family members, including a first-generation, married-in  spouse, underwent evaluation at the NIH that included a 12-lead ECG and echocardiographic examination. Informed consent for the studies was obtained in accordance with study protocols approved by the Institute Review Board of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.  Echocardiography Echocardiographic examination was performed with a Hewlett-Packard (Sonos 500 or Sonos 1000) real-time, pulsed-array, 900 ultrasonic scanner with a 2.5-MHz FIGURE 2.

Two-dimensional echocardiographic images obtained in a number of cross-sectional planes by using standard transducer positions.6 With methods described previously,7 the distribution of left ventricular hypertrophy was assessed primarily in the parasternal short-axis planes, although parasternal long-axis, apical two- and four-chamber views were also used to integrate the information obtained from the short-axis images.  j3-MHC Gene  plified fragments containing each of the 41 ,3-MHC gene exons using a modification of the procedure described by Orita.'2 Briefly, 1 ,ul of a 100-gl reaction was diluted with 9 gl of a denaturing solution (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol), heated to 80°C, plunged into an ice bath, and resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide/10% glycerol gel run at 30 W at room temperature and also on a 5% polyacrylamide gel run at 4°C.  were  Polymerase Chain Reaction and Southern Blot Analysis Each family member was phlebotomized, and DNA  Sequencing  The PCR fragments showing polymorphisms by SSCP analysis were sequenced without subcloning using a Sequenase kit (USB, Cleveland, Ohio) in one of two ways. The first method was a modification of the doublestranded sequencing protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, four 100-gl PCR products starting with 100 ng of genomic DNA from the individual of interest were concentrated using a Centricon 30 (Amicon Division, W.R. Grace & Co.). The "stop volume" was further purified on a 1.0% agarose gel with ethidium bromide, and the gel band was cut out under ultraviolet light. DNA was extracted from the gel using Qiaex (Qiagen, Chatsworth, Calif.), denatured in a final concentration of 0.2N NaOH/0.2 mM EDTA, and precipitated in three times the initial volume of ethanol. After a wash in 70% ethanol, the pellet was lyophilized and resuspended in 14 ,ul of water. Seven microliters was then used in the sequencing reaction as recommended by the manufacturer, with the exception that 1 gl of DMSO was added to the primer/template mix before boiling for 2 minutes and cooling in ice water. The second method of sequencing involved the production of single-strand template by modification of a method described previously.'3 Briefly, a biotin phosphoramidite (Midland Reagent Co., Midland, Tex.) was used to add a biotin molecule to the 5' end of an oligonucleotide primer in the last step in its synthesis on the nucleic acid synthesizer (model 380B, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). This primer, together with its mate that was not biotinolated, was used to generate the PCR-amplified fragment to be sequenced. Twenty microliters of this  extracted from isolated nuclei of peripheral white cells by procedures previously described.8 The published sequence of the human p-MHC gene9 was used to design a set of intronic primers, each of which encompassed one of the 40 3-MHC gene exons and yielded a single unique fragment of the expected size in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Intronic rather than exonic primers were used to avoid the problem of coamplification of the highly homologous cardiac a-MHC gene. PCR was performed in a 100-,ll volume using the Amplitaq enzyme (Perkins Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, Conn.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations with the exception that a thermocycler oven (Bios, New Haven, Conn.) was used. Each of the denaturation, annealing, and extension segments was for 40 seconds, and 35 cycles were performed. Annealing temperatures of >61MC were used. Radioactive labeling of the amplified fragment was accomplished through the addition of 0.1 ,Ci of a-32P dCTP 3000 Ci/mmol (Amersham, Chicago) to the 100-gl reaction volume. Southern blot analysis was performed using previously described techniques10 together with an ammonium acetate transfer technique" onto Hybond N+ nylon paper (Amersham, Chicago).

The products of all 40 primer pairs were consistently suitable for analysis. The PCR fragments amplified from DNA of the members of both kindreds were evaluated for the presence of polymorphisms on SSCP gels run at both room temperature and 4°C. Polymorphic fragments were then sequenced directly without subcloning as described in "Methods." These techniques detected several polymorphisms in both kindreds; however, the sequencing of all the polymorphisms showed that only two reflected changes in exon coding sequence. Each was unique to one of the two kindreds, and both involved the replacement of a highly conserved amino acid. These point mutations in exons 13 (kindred 2002) and 23 (kindred 2755), together with the primer pairs used to amplify them, are depicted in Table 1. Identification of the 908Leu-Val Mutation in Kindred 2755. All 40 exons of the f-MHC gene, amplified by PCR from the DNA of a subset of family members, were evaluated on SSCP gels at room temperature and 4°C. Only the fragment containing exon 23 was found to contain a polymorphism that cosegregated with the disease (Figure 3). Direct sequencing of this fragment in both directions showed a C->G transversion resulting in the replacement of a leucine by a valine at amino acid residue 908 (Figure 4). Subsequent sequencing of a cDNA clone from an affected member of the family confirmed this mutation (data not shown). This mutation destroys a Pvu II site, thus lengthening the 140 basepair fragment found in normal individuals to a 161 basepair fragment that is diagnostic of the disease in this kindred. All 19 individuals in this kindred with echocardiographic criteria for HCM had this mutation, which is shown in a subset of the kindred in Figure 5. This mutation was not seen in a survey of 100 other chromosomes. Identification of the Arg-*Gln Mutation in Kindred 2002. The same initial evaluation of the f-MHC gene exons was performed on a subset of kindred 2002. Only the two fragments containing exon 3 and exon 13 showed the presence of a polymorphism on an SSCP gel. Direct sequencing of the exon 3-containing fragment showed the mutation to lie outside of the exon and splice consensus sites. Direct sequencing in both directions of the exon 13 fragment detected a G->A transition that resulted in the replacement of an arginine by a glutamine at amino acid residue 403 (Figure 6). This mutation creates a new Dde I restriction enzyme site by changing the sequence CTCGG found in normal individuals to CTCAG, thus shortening the 161 basepair fragment found in normal individuals to a 129 basepair fragment that is found in all affected members of this  I  II  illI  FIGURE 3.

The product, now bound to beads, was then denatured with 0.2N NaOH, washed with 1X TE, and then washed with water. After the collection of the beads with a magnet, they were resuspended in 7 gl of water, and the bound template was sequenced using the complementary primer according to the manufacturer's recommendations.  Statistics Cumulative survival was determined by product-limit survival analysis using sudden cardiac death, syncope, and presyncope (profound impairment of consciousness not amounting to frank syncope) as time variables. Two product-limit survival functions were compared using the log rank test. A value of p.0.05 was considered significant.

The creation of a restriction site by a mutation, as has occurred here, corroborates the specific basepair change that was necessary to create the enzyme recognition sequence. A survey of 100 chromosomes failed to detect another instance of the 403 mutation. Disease Penetrance and Clinical Consequences of the 908 Mutation Forty-six individuals were determined to have the disease mutation: 42 by genetic analysis, two by postmortem findings, and two who were obligate carriers of the disease gene. Twelve-lead ECGs and echocardiograms were available in the 42 individuals with the 908 mutation confirmed by genotyping. Of these, 11 were young (age, 1-11 years). All the 11 young patients had normal echocardiograms except one 12-year old patient, who had an abnormal 12-lead ECG (narrow deep Q waves in leads III, aVF, and V6). None of the blood relatives in whom the 908 mutation was absent (n -165) or married-in spouses (n -37) had a maximum left ventricular wall thickness of > 12 mm (Figure 7). Of the 31 older individuals with the 908 mutation (age, 17-42 years), 12 had normal echocardiograms with maximum left ventricular wall thickness of 8-12 mm (Table 2).

A portion of the sequence of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment containing exon 13 from an affected individual in kindred 2002. The mutant allele is apparent by the presence of both an A and a G in the first position of codon 403. This results in the substitution of a glutamine for a highly conserved arginine in the derived protein sequence. The affected individual, being a heterozygote for the mutant allele, has both an A and a G in this position (marked by an arrow).  Thus, in adult individuals, the disease penetrance as estimated by echocardiography was 19 of 31, or only 61%. Of the 12 individuals with the mutation who had normal echocardiograms, five had abnormal 12-lead ECGs. These were mostly minor and nonspecific (Table 2). The disease penetrance in adults with this disease mutation by ECG and echocardiographic evaluation was therefore 24 of 31, or 77%. The 908 mutation has been associated with a low incidence of premature sudden death and syncope. Only two premature (<55 years of age) sudden deaths and one syncope occurred in the 46 individuals with the mutation. The cumulative incidence of cardiac- events (sudden death, syncope, or presyncope) related to age is shown in Figure 8. Thus, the cumulative sudden deathfree survival rates at 20 and 60 years of age were 97+±3% and 92+6%, respectively (Figure 8A). Similarly, the event (sudden death, syncope, or presyncope) -free rates were 95±3% and 90±6%, respectively (Figure 8B). Disease Penetrance and Clinical Characteristics of the 403 Mutation Of the 20 blood relatives in kindred 2002, 15 have been diagnosed as having HCM or the 403 mutation. Of these, six died suddenly between the ages of 19 and 45 years and had markedly hypertrophied hearts at autopsy examination. Of the nine living individuals with the 403 mutation, seven (age, 6-40 years) have echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy and abnormal 12-lead ECGs. None of the patients had abnormal right ventricular echocardiograms. One of the remaining two individuals, a child aged 8 years, had an abnormal ECG (narrow deep Q waves and left atrial hypertrophy). The other, aged 9 months, had a normal 12-lead ECG and echocardiogram. Thus, in this kindred, the 403 mutation was associated with early presentation of the disease and with a 100% penetrance in adults. The 403 mutation was also associated with a high incidence of cardiac events: sudden death in six, syncope in three, and presyncope in four patients. The cumulative sudden death-free rates at 20, 30, and 40 years of age were 90±9%, 68+16%, and 45±17%, respectively (Figure 8A). Similarly, the event-free rates at 20, 30, and 40 years of age were only 70±13%, 46±14%, and 8±7%, respectively (Figure 8B).  Circulation Vol 86, No 2 August 1992  350  35  *- HCA MAutation AbiorTial Echo and ECG  -  = t Cil1r  U  30  * *  -  -:  =  Ed  ,iF  --  Er J5  n  .A ti n o rril'l E C-  HCM Mutation Absent  U  E 25  -a  N', c) -tsi t11-  `  U  -  cn (n 0 C)  20  -  aU,  a  a  m a  ~._ I-  ._  15  -  10  -  g E E  ~  *0 0| 0~~~~~~Ob0c  *  coo  so*  0  2xC (U  g  oh  0  I  5  0  -I---  5  10  -  I  15  -  20  25  35  30  40  45  50  100  Age (years)  FIGURE 7.

One child had an  Discussion A detailed clinical evaluation of two of the kindreds with distinct point mutations in the f-MHC gene demonstrate that different alleles may be associated with diverse clinical presentations. Both missense mutations lay in the head or head-rod junction of the molecule, suggesting the possible occurrence of abnormal interactions between the mutated /3-MI-C molecule and associated proteins such as actin or myosin light chains. A comparison of kindreds 2755 and 2002, each with distinct missense mutations (908LcuVat and 403 Arg-GIn respectively) illustrates that the severity and penetrance of the disease may be determined by the specific mutation. Of the 195 members of kindred 2755 who were evaluated clinically, 42 individuals inherited the mutant allele. Of the 31 individuals .17 years of age with the mutant allele, 19 had a maximum left ventricular wall thickness of > 13 mm. In contrast, all 123 blood relatives without the mutant allele as well as 37 unrelated spouses had a maximum left ventricular wall thickness of <12 mm. Thus, 12 adult members with the mutant allele failed to meet this echocardiographic criterion for  HCM  a  definition of HCM that  was  less  stringent  than  that used traditionally to diagnose the disease (maximum left ventricular wall thickness >15 mmt4). Furthermore, seven of these 12 adults also had normal 12-lead ECGs; hence, the disease penetrance for the adults in this kindred was only 61% when the echocardiographic threshold of >12 mm was used and 77% when ECG analysis was included in the diagnostic criteria. In addition, none of 11 children with the mutant allele had left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiogram, and only one child, aged 12 years, had an abnormal 12-lead ECG. In contrast to kindred 2755, all 11 adults in kindred 2002 had left ventricular hypertrophy and abnormal 12-lead ECGs. Moreover, of four children with the mutant allele, two had left ventricular hypertrophy and three had abnormal 12-lead ECGs. The only child with normal cardiac findings was a 9-month-old female patient. Thus, the disease penetrance in this kindred was 100% in adults by echocardiographic criteria and 93% in all ages when the ECG analysis was added to the diagnostic criteria.  Epstein et al HCM and Two Distinct Mutations in the f-MHC Gene  351  TABLE 2.

Sex/age  Patient  Although the disease penetrance by echocardiographic evaluation was significantly less in kindred 2755 than in 2002, there were many members of kindred 2755 who were symptomatic and had severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Indeed, the morphological appearances in affected members of the two kindreds did not differ significantly. Despite these findings, the incidence of premature sudden death in kindred 2755 was significantly lower than in kindred 2002 (Figure 8). A high incidence of premature sudden death associated with the 403 mutation was also present in a previously reported French-Canadian kindred with the identical mutation.1'5 In this French-Canadian kindred, seven premature sudden deaths occurred in 44 affected members. Kindred 2002 is the second family with the 403 mutation described in the literature. The fact that both kindreds with this mutation exhibit a high incidence of premature sudden death lends credence to the concept of mutation-associated disease characteristics. The occurrence of the same point mutation in two kindreds that we believe are unrelated is intriguing although not novel in genetics. It is possible that a common ancestor is responsible for a "common founder effect."'15 Comparison of the locus polymorphism haplotypes in these two kindreds would address that question. "Hot spots" for mutations have been proposed as an explanation for the independent occurrence of the same mutation. Previously described in the gene encoding factor VIII,16 these hot spots involve methylation of a cytosine in a CpG dinucleotide and its subsequent spontaneous deamination to thymine. This event however, did not apply to the 403 mutation. A further consideration is that myosin is such a critical protein that only a limited number of mutations is compatible with life, and identical mutations would be expected to occur in unrelated kindreds. Only one of the two mutations involved a change in the charge of the amino acid residue, i.e., the 403 mutation in exon 13. Thus, although a change in charge may be disruptive and may lead to a defect in the  A.  100  90  & 80 *  4!.s  70 60  t 60  t 40  d 30 a 20 10 0  12  24  36  48  60  48  60  PAtient Age (,wera)  B. 100  90 80  J*  j 'a  70  60 60  U  40 30  20 10 0  12  24  Patiet Age  36  ~J  FIGURE 8.

The question of how these point mutations may cause HCM is still undetermined. Changes that result from these base substitutions may affect the functional integrity of the molecule itself, its interaction with other myosin molecules (mutated or wild type), or other molecules that interact with the myosin head. The latter possibility is particularly interesting, as exon 13 encodes a region that may bind actin.17 The 908 mutation in exon 23 is located in the 5' end of the rod. Traditionally, the invariant proline at residue 838 in the human ,B-MHC gene has been considered to mark the border between the head and rod portion of the molecule. The use of specific monoclonal antibodies and physical mapping by electronmicroscopic studies on a Acathamoeba myosin II have suggested that the true border is closer to the 900 amino acid residue.18 Thus, the mutation at residue 908, although involving the relatively conservative substitution of a valine for a leucine, occurred at what may be an important transition portion of the myosin molecule. Careful clinical evaluation of HCM pedigrees with distinct myosin mutations should help to delineate mutation-specific patterns of disease, as has been described in this study. These, in turn, may prove useful in prognosis and management of patients. At the molecular level, evaluation of the set of mutant myosin molecules with respect to motility, ATP binding and hydrolysis, actin binding and myosin light chain binding may further elucidate the etiology of the disease and suggest strategies for intervention in the disease process.

A 908Leu----Val mutation and a 403Arg----Gln mutation.BACKGROUND The disease gene for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been identified as the beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC) gene in some HCM families. We describe extensive clinical evaluations in two kindreds with two distinct point mutations in the beta-MHC gene. METHODS AND RESULTS We used single-strand confirmation polymorphism (SSCP) gel analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified products capturing each of the 40 beta-MHC gene exons to identify distinct missense mutations in two HCM kindreds. Clinical, ECG, and echocardiographic studies were performed in the two kindreds: kindred 2755 with amino acid 908Leu----Val mutation and kindred 2002 with amino acid 403Arg----Gln mutation. The morphological appearances of HCM were similar in these two kindreds. However, the two kindreds differed with respect to disease penetrance, age of onset of disease, and incidence of premature sudden death. Twelve of 31 adults (greater than or equal to 17 years) with the disease gene in kindred 2755 did not have left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and only five of these had ECG abnormalities. Thus, the disease penetrance in adults with this mutation was only 61%. None of 11 children aged less than 16 years had LVH. The 908 mutation was associated with a low incidence of cardiac events: Only two sudden deaths and one syncope occurred in 46 individuals with the mutant allele. In contrast, LVH was present in all 11 adults in kindred 2002 with the 403 mutation (100% disease penetrance). In addition, three of four affected children were symptomatic and had clinical evidence of HCM. The disease in this kindred was severe and resulted in six premature sudden deaths. Seven additional patients had syncope or presyncope. CONCLUSIONS In some kindreds, the HCM disease gene is more prevalent than indicated by echocardiography and ECG. Some point mutations may be associated with a more malignant prognosis. Preclinical identification of children with mutations associated with a high incidence of sudden death and syncope provides the opportunity to evaluate efficacy of early therapeutic interventions. "

To investigate its possible role, we have analyzed the coding exons of the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene (WT1) for germline mutations. In ten independent cases of Denys-Drash syndrome, point mutations in the zinc finger domains of one WT1 gene copy were found. Nine of these mutations are found within exon 9 (zinc finger III); the remaining mutation is in exon 8 (zinc finger II). These mutations directly affect DNA sequence recognition. In two families analyzed, the mutations were shown to arise de novo. Wilms' tumors from three individuals and one juvenile granulosa cell tumor demonstrate reduction to homo-  zygosity for the mutated WT1 allele. Our results provide evidence of a direct role for WT1 in Denys-Drash syndrome and thus urogenital system development. Introduction  Wilms' tumor (WT) is an embryonal malignancy of the kidney arising from the metanephric blastema, affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 children (Young and Miller, 1975; Matsunaga, 1981). A tumor suppressor gene for this disease, WT1 from chromosome 11p13, has recently been isolated (Call et al., 1990; Gessler et al., 1990). All or part of WT1 is homozygously deleted in a small but highly informative set of sporadic Wilms' tumors (Lewis et al., 1988; Gessler et al., 1990; Ton et al., 1991; Davis et al., 1991; Royer-Pokora et al., 1991). Several sporadic and hereditary WTs have been described in which WT1 is specifically altered, providing molecular evidence for the involvement of this gene in Wilms' tumor etiology (Haber et al., 1990; Huff et al., 1991; Pelletier et al., 1991a). The WT1 gene contains ten coding exons that produce four distinct WT1 mRNAs, reflecting the presence or absence of two alternatively spliced exons (Haber et al., 1990, 1991). The predicted WT1 polypeptides show several features characteristic of transcription factors (i.e., nuclear localization, four contiguous Cys2-His2zinc finger domains, and an amino terminus rich in proline and glutamine residues) (Call et al., 1990; Gessler et al., 1990; Pelletier et al., 1991c). The zinc finger domains of the WT1 polypeptides and a class of early growth response mammalian polypeptides (the EGR and Krox family), activated during GOto G1 transition in culture cells, show considerable homology to each other (Call et al., 1990; Gessler et al., 1990) and recognize similar binding sites (Rauscher et al., 1990). The EGR and Krox gene products are thought to be important nuclear intermediates in signal transduction. WT1 expression during nephrogenesis in the kidneys is limited to the condensed mesenchyme, renal vesicle, and glomerular epithelial cell and therefore is likely to play a specific role in glomerular development during kidney organogenesis (Pritchard-Jones et al., 1990). The following recent results have also implicated WT1 in development of the genital system. First,.the incidence rates of hypospadias (ventrally placed external penile urinary orifice) and cryptorchidism (undescended testis) among patients with bilateral Wilms' tumor is at least 10-fold higher than in the generalpopulation (Bond, 1975; Breslow and Beckwith, 1982). Second, an association between urogenital system anomalies with early onset WTs and intralobar nephroblastomatosis has been suggested based on statistical data (Breslow et al., 1988; Beckwith et al., 1989). Third, high levels of WT1 mRNA expression are observed in the developing gonads early in fetal development (Pritchard-Jones et al., 1990; Pelletier et al., 1991c). In the mature gonads, WT1 expression is restricted to the Sertoli cells of the testis and granulosa and epithelial cells of the ovaries (Pelletier et al., 1991c). Fourth, molecular analysis  Cell 438  of the WT1 gene in two children with Wilms' tumor and genital system malformations (hypospadias and undescended testis) has revealed small hemizygous intragenic deletions within WT1 in both individuals (Pelletier et al., 1991a). Both deletions disrupt the WT1 reading frame. These results imply a central role for the WT1 gene product in genital system development. A genetic predisposition to WT is observed in two disease syndromes with similar genital system malformations. In the WAGR syndrome, there is an association of Wilms' tumor (W) with congenital aniridia (A) (absence or malformation of the iris), genitourinary malformations (G), and mental retardation (R) (Miller et al., 1964). This syndrome is correlated with constitutional deletions within chromosome 11 band p13 (Riccardi et al., 1978). This constellation of anomalies, which show variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance, define a cluster of genes within 1lp13 important in the development of the iris, kidney, urogenital tract, and brain. As described above, recent results suggest that the genital system anomalies associated with WAGR syndrome are a phenotype resulting from a null mutation in one WTI allele. Denys et al. (1967) and Drash et al. (1971) have described an association of Wilms' tumor with male pseudohermaphroditism and progressive renal failure. This is a rare Wilms' tumorassociated syndrome, with only about 60 cases reported in the literature over the last 20 years (for a review, see Pelletier et al., 1991b). The nephropathy associated with this syndrome generally occurs very early (before the age of 2 years) and in conjunction with WT or genital abnormalities or both (Habib et al., 1985). It is characterized by a specific glomerular lesion--shrunken glomerular tufts with accumulation of matrix material in the mesangium, surrounded by hypertrophied epithelial cells (podocytes) (Habib et al., 1985). Denys-Drash patients who develop WT usually have bilateral tumors and present earlier than individualswith sporadic tumors, suggesting the presence of a predisposing germline mutation in these individuals. The genital abnormality described most often is male pseudohermaphroditism, wherein children have either ambiguous external genitalia or a normal female phenotype with an XY karyotype. Large deletions of 1lp13 are not observed, and no abnormalities of the X or Y chromosomes have been detected (Jadresic et al., 1991). Many of these children have streak gonads, and several cases have developed gonadoblastomas. The pattern of inheritance in Denys-Drash syndrome is sporadic and, if dominant, unlikely to be transmitted. The localized expression of WT1 in the developing glomeruli (i.e., epithelial cells) (Pritchard-Jones et al., 1990) and its implication in genital system development (Pritchard-Jones et al., 1990; Pelletier et al., 1991c) suggested to us that Denys-Drash syndrome could be a single gene defect involving WT1. In this report, we present our analysis of the WT1 gene in ten individuals with Denys-Drash syndrome. Exon 9 of WT1 (which encodes the third zinc finger domain) is a "hot spot" for mutations associated with this syndrome. Nine out of ten independent cases analyzed have specific point mutations in exon 9 of the WT1 gene. These mutations affect the DNA-binding properties  of WT1. Our results indicate that Denys-Drash syndrome is the consequence of dominant-negative mutations to the WT1 gene.  Results Single-Strand Conformational Polymorphism Analysis of the WT1 Gene in Individuals'with Denys-Drash Syndrome We analyzed the WT1 gene in individuals with DenysDrash syndrome to determine whether germline mutations could account for their genital and glomerular abnormalities as well as their predisposition toward developing Wilms' tumor. Genomic DNA was isolated from EBVtransformed lymphocytes or peripheral blood lymphocytes from ten individuals with Denys-Drash syndrome. Many of these individuals had the classical triad of Denys-Drash syndrome, consisting of renal failure due to diffuse mesangial sclerosis, pseudohermaphroditism, and Wilms' tumor. Several individuals have undergone prophylactic nephrectomy to prevent development of Wilms' tumor. Extensive analysis by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting failed to detect any deletions or rearrangements within the WT1 gene of these individuals (J. Pelletier and W. Bruening, data not shown). We then used the more sensitive assay of single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) to search for single base pair mutations within the WT1 gene. This technique is based on the principle that under nondenaturing conditions, single-stranded DNA assumes a sequence-specific folded structure maintained by sequence-dependent local intramolecular interactions (Orita et al., 1989). Sequence changes are thus detected as mobility shifts due to changes in the folded conformations of the separated strands, allowing detection of even single base substitutions. The exon/intron structure of the WT1 gene has recently been determined (Haber et al., 1991). Oligonucleotides flanking the exons of the WT1 gene were radiolabeled and used to amplify, by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), each individual WT1 exon. No differences were observed for the individuals studied for any exon except exons 8 and 9. However, a striking pattern of mobility shifts was observed when single-stranded DNA from the PCR reactions of exon 9 (zinc finger Ill) are analyzed on neutral polyacrylamide gels (Figure 1A). Analysis of the exon 9 PCR products from genomic DNA of all Denys-Drash individuals, with the exception of two (S. V. and W. Y.), demonstrated a product comigrating with the normal human PCR product (indicated by an arrowhead) and an altered migrating PCR product (indicated by an arrow) (Figure 1A, lanes 3 to 11). PCR products from individuals S. V. and W. Y. produced a mobility shift pattern similar to that obtained from the nonaffected DNA sample (Figure 1A, compare lanes 5 and 11 with lane 2). PCR-SSCP analysis of exon 8 (zinc finger domain II) from patient S. V. revealed a novel altered migrating fragment (indicated by an arrow, Figure 1B, compare lane 3 with lane 2). These results strongly implicate mutations in the zinc finger segments of the WT1 gene in the pathophysiology of Denys-Drash syndrome.  Germline Mutationsin WT1 in Denys-Drash Syndrome 439  A.

C.  Sequence Analysis of WT1 in Individuals with Denys-Drash Syndrome The sequence of the respective exons of the Denys-Drash individuals that produced the mobility shifts by SSCP analysis (Figure 1) were determined as described in the Experimental Procedures. Direct sequencing of the PCR product from exon 8 of patient S. V. (Figure 1B) revealed a G to A transition within the second zinc finger domain of one WT1 allele (Figure 2A). This mutation results in the conversion of 3~Arg to His (Figure 2A). Sequencing of PCR products of individuals showing mobility shifts of exon 9 revealed that the majority of these patients (A. M., C. B., A. U., P. I., S. E., and R. S.) carry the same hemizygous mutation (Figure 2B and data not shown). These individuals all carried the identical point mutation (C to T transition) in exon 9 of one WT1 allele (Figure 2B). This mutation converts 3~Arg to Trp within the third zinc finger domain of WT1 (Figure 2B). The affected amino acid residue is conserved in WT1 zinc fingers II, III, and IV and corresponds to the same residue altered in zinc finger II of S. V. Patients B. E. and W. Y. show different mutations within exon 9, both of which affect the same amino acid--3~Asp (Figure 2B). One mutation converts 3-~Asp to Gly, whereas the other converts ~eAsp to Asn. These results, summarized in Figure 2, suggest an important functional role for these amino acids in WT1 function. Although the PCR product of exon 9 from W. Y. failed to demonstrate a mobility shift by nondenaturing gel analysis, a mutation was found when exon 9 was analyzed by direct PCR sequencing. Table 1 summarizes these results and compares the phenotypes characterized for each of the individuals with Denys-Drash syndrome studied. Genetic Models for Denys-Drash Syndrome .The identification of mutations in the WT1 gene in DenysDrash patients poses the issue of mode of inheritance in this syndrome. Denys-Drash syndrome might show a recessive mode of inheritance, with the rare occurrence of  the syndrome a consequence of the inheritance of infrequent mutant alleles at the WT1 locus from each parent. However, as noted above, we observed no additional SSCP gel shifts in the WT1 gene in any individual studied, suggesting that no additional mutations in either allele of the WT1 gene are present in these Denys-Drash patients. To further examine this possibility, we analyzed all the ten coding exons of patient A. M. by direct PCR sequencing and found no other mutation in either alleles (W. Bruening and J. Pelletier, data not shown). Our results thus appear most consistent with a dominant mode of inheritance for Denys-Drash syndrome. Each of the ten cases we have analyzed is an independent occurrence of Denys-Drash syndrome. We suggest that each case represents a new mutation in the WT1 gene. If the penetrance of the WT1 alleles we have analyzed is very high, then it is extremely unlikely that parents of Denys-Drash individuals will carry such mutations. In two families we have tested this view. As shown in Figure 1C (lanes 1-6), neither parents of patients C. B. or B. E. carry the mutant allele of their affected child. As predicted, by a dominant model for inheritance with high penetrance, patients C. B. and B. E. represent occurrences of de novo mutation in the WT1 gene.  Analysis of Tumors from Individuals with Denys-Drash Syndrome M. W. and R. S. are young children with Denys-Drash syndrome (see Table 1). PCR-SSCP analysis of WT1 exon 9 from their peripheral lymphocyte DNA revealed a mobility shift pattern similar to that observed for the majority of other Denys-Drash individuals (Figure 3A, lanes 3 and 4). Both individuals carry the same exon 9 germiine point mutation found in the majority of other Denys-Drash individuals studied in this report (see Table 1), which converts 3~Arg to Trp at the amino acid level (data not shown for M. W.). M. W. and R. S. both have been treated for Wilms' tumor (see Table 1). We used PCR-SSCP analysis to investigate the status of the WT1 gene in the tumors from  Cell 44O  A G  A T C  Figure 2.

These samples were available to us only as paraffin-embedded tumor blocks. PCR-SSCP analysis of WT1 exon 9 on sections from each tumor was performed as described in the Experimental Procedures and revealed that both tumors had lost the normal WT1 allele (Figure 3A, compare lane 3 with lane 5 and lane 4 with lane 6). A third Denys-Dr,ash individual, C. B., as a child developed Wilms' tumor, bilateral gonadoblastoma, and a juvenile granulosa cell tumor (Table 1). This individual carries the same germline point mutation in the WT1 gene as M. W. and R. S. (see Figure 1A, lane 4). The Wilms' and juvenile granulosa cell tumor from this individual demonstrated loss of the normal WT1 allele when analyzed by PCRSSCP (Figure 3B, compare lanes 4 and 5 with lane 3). These results implicate the WT1 gene in etiology of a nonWilms' tumor malignancy.  WT1 Denys-Drash Mutations Affect DNA Binding The WT1 protein product has been shown to bind, in a sequence-specific manner, to a sequence similar to that recognized by the Early Growth Response-1 gene (EGR-1) product, a zinc finger containing protein induced by mitogenic stimuli (Rauscher et al., 1990). We decided to use the EGR-1 binding site (5'-CGCCCCCGC-3~ (Cao et al., 1990) to determine whether any of the mutations we had identified in Denys-Drash individuals affected WT1 bind-  ing. Two mutations were rebuilt into the WT1 cDNA: the ~18°Cto) T transition converting 394Argto Trp (the resulting protein product is referred to as WTl(394W)); and the "SeG to A transition, which substitutes an Asn for 396Asp (the resulting protein product is referred to as WTI(~N)). These mutations were reconstructed in a murine WT1 cDNA lacking both alternatively spliced exons as described in the Experimental Procedures. The third zinc finger domain is 100% conserved at the amino acid level between human and murine cDNAs (Buckler et al., 1991). In vitro transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase generated capped mRNA transcripts corresponding to each WT1 cDNA, as well as to an EGR-1 cDNA that served as a positive control. Translation of these synthetic mRNA species in the presence of [35S]methionine yielded polypeptides of the expected molecular mass (Figure 4A). To assess the effect of the Denys-Drash mutations on WTl-binding activity, gel-shift assays were performed using Egr-1 and WTI products synthesized in reticulocyte lysates. An oligonucleotide(EG R), described in the Experimental Procedures, that contains the Egr-1 core consensus binding site was used in our mobility shift assays. In addition, a second oligonucleotide (M2), which contains a single base substitution and does not bind to Egr-1 or WT1 proteins (Rauscher et al., 1990), was synthesized and used as a negative control in our assays. The Egr-1 protein  Germline Mutations in WT1 in Denys-Drash Syndrome 441  Table 1.

These complexes are specifically inhibited by a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled EGR oligonucleotide (lane 3), but not by an equivalent amount of M2 oligonucleotide (lane 4). As previously reported, Egr-1 does not bind to 32p-labeled M2 oligonucleotide (lane 5) (Rauscher et al., 1990). The results demonstrate the specificity of our assay system. The Wilms' tumor gene product is capable of binding to 32p-labeled EGR oligonucleotide, although at a significantly reduced efficiency compared to Egr-1 (Figure 4C, lane 2). This lower binding efficiency is observed despite a ,~40-fold excess of WT1 protein (as determined by TCA precipitation of parallel in vitro translation reactions and ~=tandardizing for methionine content). The WT1 binding is also specifically inhibited by a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled EGR oligonucleotide(lane 3), but is not inhibited by an equivalent amount of M2 oligonucleotide (lane 4). WT1 does not bind to 32p-labeled M2 oligonucleotide (lane 5). Neither of the two mutant WT1 protein products, WTI(3-~W) or VMTI(3~N), are capable of binding to the EGR-1 consensus sequence (lanes 6 and 7, respectively). Our results demonstrate that the mutations we have characterized in Denys-Drash individuals result in polypeptides that can no longer efficiently bind DNA with the sequence specificity of the normal polypeptide. These  altered peptide products could behave either in a dominant-negative fashion by sequestering a polypeptide required for WT1 function or in a gain-of-function manner by activating or repressing genes not normally under WT1 control. Discussion The identification of mutations in the zinc finger region of WT1 in patients with the severe developmental abnormalities of Denys-Drash syndrome provides a framework for understanding the role of the WT1 gene in controlling cell differentiation and proliferation. The cells of the developing kidney that express the highest levels of the WT1 gene product (glomerular epithelial cells) are precisely those cells that are the precursors to the aberrant structures observed in the nephropathic kidneys of DenysDrash syndrome. The pathology of Denys-Drash syndrome involves hypertrophy of these cells. It is thus not unreasonable to presume that disturbances of WT1 function in these cells are the cause of their aberrant differentiation and hence that the normal role of WT1 is to initiate a transcriptional program that controls the differentiation of these cells. The renal failure observed in these individuals would therefore be secondary to processes affecting glomerular development during embryogenesis. Similarly, the WT1 gene product expression in cells of  Cell 442  A.  a.  •  1 2  3  4  I-  I--  5  6  1  2  3  4  5  Figure 3.

Genitourinary anomalies are relatively common in the general population, and their expression varies enormously among Denys-Drash patients. Normally in males, the Wolffian ducts give rise to the epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles during embryogenesis whereas in females, the MQIlerian ducts will give rise to the fallopian tubes, uterus, and upper vagina. That Deny,s-Drash patients have both sets of internal structure implies a key role for WT1 in primary sex determination. The proper signals for regression of the MQIlerian ducts, as well as development of the Wolffian structures, are not present during development in Denys-Drash individuals with a 46,XY karyotype (see Table 1). The spectrum of genital system anomalies range from streak ovaries to dysgenic testis and the absence or presence of Wolffian or MQIlerian structures (see Table 1). Even individuals carrying the same mutation (Table 1; e.g., S. E. and M. W.) show variability in expressivity (S. E. has a normal ovary, whereas M. W. has streak gonads), which may be due to additional genetic factors. Mutations in the WT1 gene in Denys-Drash patients must do more than reduce WT1 gene dosage by eliminating the function of one allele of the WT1 gene. A wellcharacterized class of patients, those with the WAGR syndrome, have reduced dosage of the WT1 gene owing to • large or small intragenic deletions, which include the WT1 gene.

The most common developmental lesions associated with hemizygosity at WT1 in males are hypospadias and cryptorchidism. The constellation of anomalies in DenysDrash syndrome includes renal failure, pseudohermaphroditism, and Wilms' tumor. The renal failure associated with this syndrome is the result of progressive glomerular sclerosis and occurs within the first few years of life (Habib et al., 1985). The much more severe disruption on development of the genital system in Denys-Drash syndrome than observed in WAGR syndrome supports the notion that germline dominant-negative or gain-of-function lesions at the WT1 locus have a more pronounced effect on development than a reduction of WT1 dosage. The fact that individuals with WAGR syndrome do not develop nephropathies suggests that the renal system is not as sensitive as the genital system to a reduction in WT1 dosage during embryogenesis. We have analyzed three Wilms' tumors and one granuIosa cell tumor from three individuals with Denys-Drash syndrome and have found that all have undergone reduction to homozgosity for the mutated WT1 copy. Previous studies of WTs associated with Denys-Drash syndrome also show reduction to homozygosity for 1 l p (Schroeder et al., 1987; Dao et al., 1987). Hereditary Wilms' tumors, which account for less than 5% of all WT cases, were essential in formulating the "two hit" mutational model of tumorigenesis (Knudson and Strong, 1972). According to this model, the majority of sporadic tumors develop following two somatic mutational events within the same target cell, while hereditary cases (bilateral and familial) develop because these individuals carry a germline mutation at the appropriate locus, and only one additional somatic mutational event is required. Our findings in tumors of Denys-Drash individuals are consistent with this hypothesis. The WT1 mutations observed in Denys-Drash are dominant in their effects on urogenital development. However, the dominant effect of these mutations in tumorigenesis is more difficult to establish. The fact that all DenysDrash tumors that we examined show loss of the wild-type allele indicates a growth advantage to cells that have no normal WT1 gene product. Similar observations regarding the loss of the wild-type allele in colorectal tumors have been made for p53 mutations known to act by a dominantnegative mechanism (Baker et al., 1989). Dominant mutations of WT1 may lead to tumorigenesis without requiring loss of the normal allele, as demonstrated by a sporadic Wilms' tumor that had a WT1 mutation deleting zinc finger III yet retained the normal WT1 allele (Haber et al., 1990). The data presented here support a central role for the WT1 transcription factor in the control of at least two differentiation programs. Although many transcription factors have been described to date, only two have been implicated in a direct manner in the control of human development. Germline mutations within the testis-determining gene (SRY) in humans have been found in individuals with anomalies in genital system development (Berta et al., 1990; J&ger et al., 1990). Vortkamp et al. (1991) have described translocations in Greig syndrome, an autosomal  dominant disorder affecting limb and craniofacial development in humans, disrupting the GL13 zinc finger gene. Our description of mutations within WT1 that result in abnormal development, as well as predisposing to Wilms' tumors (and possibly granulosa cell tumors), provides a direct link between development and oncogenesis. WT1 is unique in its demonstrated role in both tumor suppression and development. Individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome do not have developmental anomalies (Malkin et al., 1990; Srivastava et al., 1990). Likewise, no developmental anomalies have been described for individuals carrying germline mutations in the retinoblastoma predisposing gene. It will clearly be of interest to determine whether WT1 is representative of a class of tumor suppressor genes that play a central role in controlling cell differentiation. What is the effect of the mutations we have described on WT1 function? We have tested two of the Denys-Drash mutations in a DNA mobility shift assay (Figure 4). The WT1 protein product binds the Egr-1 consensus sequence (5'-GCGGGGGCG-3') (Figure 4C). This functional assay permitted us to determine that both mutations within WT1 zinc finger III tested are not competent for DNA binding. Pavletich and Pabo (1991) have determined the crystal structure of a complex containing the three zinc fingers from Zif268 (also known as Egr-1) and a consensus DNAbinding site. Their results show that the zinc fingers bind in the major groove of B-DNA and that most of the contacts are made with the guanine-rich strand. Because of the conserved nature of the zinc fingers between WT1 and Egr-1, WT1 presumably behaves in a similar manner. Important side chains involved in these contacts would include an arginine that immediately precedes an a helix and that hydrogen bonds with a guanine (highlighted in the Egr-1 recognition sequence: 5'-GCGGGGGCG-3') (see Figures 5A and 5B). This is the same arginine that is found mutated in the majority of Denys-Drash individuals and results in loss of DNA binding. It is of interest to note that the control oligonucleotide we used (M2:5'-GCGGGTGCG-3') does not bind to WT1 or Egr-1 (Figures 4B and 4C) and affects the guanine that hydrogen bonds with this arginine. This arginine contact is stabilized by a conserved aspartic acid that occurs as the second residue in each of the a helices (Pavletich and Pabo, 1991). It is striking that in the only two Denys-Drash individuals who do not carry an Arg mutation within zinc finger II or III, the amino acid affected is the aspartic acid residue two residues downstream of the arginine group discussed above. Both oxygens of the carboxylate group of the aspartic acid are thought to be in a hydrogen bond-salt bridge interaction with the N, and N, of the guanidinium group of the arginine (Pavletich and Pabo, 1991) (Figure 5B). This interaction is essential for DNA recognition, since replacement of aspartic acid for asparagine in the WT1 cDNA negated DNA sequence recognition (Figure 4C). This interaction is thought to stabilize the long side chain of arginine and enhance the specificity of the arginine-guanine contacts (Pavletich and Pabo, 1991). The nature of the mutations we have described for individuals with Denys-Drash syndrome is striking. The 394Argto Trp mutation may represent a hot spot within the  Cell 444  A.

WTI gene susceptible to mutagenic events. The C to T transition at this site arose in the context of a CpG dinucleotide and likely resulted from the deamination of 5-methylcytosine at this position. The location of the other mutations within zinc fingers II and III represents a very restricted set of the possible mutations that might abrogate DNA binding of the zinc fingers. Why are so specific a set of mutational sites observed in Denys-Drash syndrome? Perhaps these sites are the most prone to mutagenesis. Alternatively, it is possible that the zinc fingers of WT1 carry out other functions besides DNA binding such as nuclear localization, dimerization, or interaction with other polypeptides. If this were the case, it is possible that mutations at other sites than those observed might disrupt a second function of the zinc fingers and prevent the mutant polypeptide from causing a dominant effect. A third alternative is that the dominant effects of WT1 mutations in Denys-Drash syndrome are due to the acquisition of the mutant polypeptide with the capacity to bind to previously unrecognized DNA sequences, causing disruptions in the transcriptional program. According to this scenario, only mutations at specific sites in the DNA binding domain might cause such gain of function. Our study raises the possibility that mutations in the WT1 gene may have im-  pact in a broader range of contexts than have been previously thought. For example, the description of familial incidence of glomerulopathy associated with male pseudohermaphroditism (Frasier et al., 1964) and two siblings with WT (Zunin and Soave, 1965) may provide examples of incomplete penetrance of Denys-Drash WT1 mutations. Current experiments are in progress to determine whether WT1 is altered in familial cases of diffuse mesangial sclerosis with and without other features of Denys-Drash syndrome. Our results suggest that WT1 function may be abrogated in non-Wilms' tumor malignancies, as we have shown for a juvenile granulosa cell tumor from a DenysDrash individual. Ovarian tumors of the granulosa cell type should clearly be one focus of such studies. The WT1 mutations we have described for Denys-Drash syndrome are predicted to act in a dominant-negative or gain-of-function fashion. These mutations directly affect the DNA-binding properties of WT1 and also clearly implicate a role for WT1 in urogenital development. It is of interest to note that the binding affinity of the WT1 polypeptide for the Egr-1 recognition sequence is at least 40-fold lower than the affinity of Egr-1 for this sequence. It is thus possible that the correct recognition sequence for WT1 is related but not identical to the Egr-1 recognition sequence. Of particular interest would be the identification of genes controlled by WT1. This would permit the identification of relevant DNA-binding sites for WT1 from a functional point of view and would permit the more direct analysis of the genetic program that WT1 controls. These results provide a clear example of a recessive oncogene that is mutated in a hereditary human malformation.

Biopolymer Center, were used to prime the sequencingreactions.No less than sevencloneswere sequencedto ensureagainstTaq polymeraseartifacts and determinethe sequenceof both alleles at specific loci. Cell Lines and EBV Immortalization  Lymphocyteswereisolatedfromfreshlydrawnbloodand immortalized with Epstein-Barrvirus (EBV)as previouslydescribed(Gladeand Beratis, 1976).Lymphoblastoidcell linesweregrownin Iscove'smedium supplementedwith 15% fetal calf serum.  Germline Mutations in WT1 in Denys-Drash Syndrome 445  Genomic DNA Isolation Genomic DNA was prepared from lymphoblastoid cell lines as follows. Cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and resuspended in TNE (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 100 mM NaCI, 25 mM EDTA) containing 250 pg/ml proteinase K (BMC), 0.5% SDS, and 0.05 mg/ml RNAase A. The DNA was extracted by gentle shaking at 37°C for 14 hr. The lysate was extracted twice with buffer-saturated (100 mM Tris [pH 8.0]) phenol, twice with buffer-saturated phenolchloroform [1/1], and twice with chloroform. Following the addition of 0.1 vol 3 M sodium acetate and 2.5 vol ethanol, the genomic DNA was spooled out of solution, washed in 70% ethanol, and rasuspended in T. E. (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA). Samples were quantitated by reading the absorbance at 260 nm. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples (10 ml) as follows. Samples were spun at 3000 rpm for 10 min in a Sorval Refrigerated Table Top Centrifuge (RT-6000). The pellet was gently resuspended in 1 ml of T. E., and 100 p.I of 0.5 M EDTA was added. The sample was vortexed, and SDS was added to a final concentration of 4% and incubated at 65°C for 10 rain. After the addition of proteinase K and RNAase A to a final concentration of 1.6 mg/ml and 0.3 mg/ml, respectively, the samples were incubated at 65°C for 90 rain. Four milliliters of T. E. was then added to the samples, which were phenol extracted twice, phenol-chloroform extracted twice, chloroform extracted, and the DNA recovered by ethanol precipitation. Genomic DNA was isolated from tissues embedded in paraffin as previously described (Wright and Manos, 1990). Briefly, sections (10 p.m) were scraped (,'~5 mm 2) from a glass microscope slide, placed into an Eppendorf centrifuge tube, deparaffinized by washing twice in xylene, once in 95% ethanol, once in 70% ethanol, and air dried. The sample was resuspended in 100 ml of 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 4 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated at 37°C in the presence of proteinase K 100 p.g/ml. The sample was then phenol-chloroform, chloroform extracted once, and half of the sample was used directly for PCR analysis as described below. PCR Amplification and SSCP Analysis The PCR was performed using a DNA thermocycler (Perkin-ElmerCetus) with 0.1 p~g of genomic DNA in a total volume of 20 p.I. Thirty cycles of amplification were carried out; each cycle consisted of I min at 94°C, 1 min at the optimally determined annealing temperature for each oligonucleotide pair, and 1 min at 72°C. Prior to the PCR, one oligonucleotide was radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and ['f-=P]ATP. After the reactions, aliquots of 2 p.I were mixed with 8 rtl of 95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromophenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF and boiled for 5 rain. Samples (2 p.I) were loaded onto 80/0 polyacrylamide (50:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) gels, and electrophoresis was carried out at 30 W in the cold room. The gel was dried on filter paper and exposed to X-ray film at - 7 0 ° C for 6-12 hr with an intensifying screen. For direct sequencing of PCR products, PCR was performed as described above using the following unlabeled oligonucleotides: for exon 8: A8, 5'-CCCCGAATTCGI-ICTGTTGGTTTGCCAGG-3'and $8, 5'-CCCCAAGCTTGCCI-IAATGAGATCCCTTTCC-3'; for exon 9: A9, 5'-CCCCGAATICAAGATAGCCACGCACTAI-ICC-3' and $9, 5'CCCCAAGCTTCAGGAAATGCTGGGCTCC-3'. Amplifications were performed at 55°C for 30 cycles, and the PCR products were purified from a low-melting agarose gel as described (Langridge et al., 1980). Thirty cycles of asymmetric PCR were performed using the oligonucleotides described in Figure 1, with an uneven molar ratio of the two primers (100:1). The amplified mixture was diluted, phenol-chloroform extracted, passed through a G50 spun-dialysis column, and ethanol precipitated. One-fifth of the reaction mixture was used for dideoxy sequencing using'a Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical), and the ~Pkinased oligonucleotide used at the lowest concentration in the asymmetric PCR. Products were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 M urea. WTI Mutsgenesis and Expression Vectors Plasmid pKS/mWT[-/-] contains the entire coding region of the WT1 murine cDNA (1290 nucleotidas [nts]) along with 41 nucieotides of 5'-noncoding and 110 nts of 3'-noncoding sequence. The WT1 murine cDNA sequence has been previously reported (Buckler et al., 1991) and the initiator methionine site defined (Pelletier et al., 1991). A mu-  rine cDNA clone lacking both alternative splice exons was restricted with Sau 3AI (which cleaves 41 nts upstream of the initiator methionine and 110 nts downstream of the stop codon [see Buckler etal., 1991]). The 1441 bp fragment was separated from vector sequence by gel electrophoresis in low temperature melting agarose. The appropriate band was visualized and excised under long-wave UV light after staining the gel with ethidium bromide. DNA was purified from the agarose, as previously described (Langridge et al., 1980). This Sau 3AI fragment was then subcloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript II KS+. After transformation of Escherichia coil strain HB101, and restriction analysis of plasmid DNA from individual clones, a clone was chosen whose 5' end was nearest the T3 promoter. This clone is referred to as pKSI mWT[-/-]. Mutagenesis of WT1 was performed by PCR using two sets of primers, one primer from each pair targeting the desired sequence to be changed and incorporating that desired nt change in its sequence. To construct the ~ A r g to ~Trp mutant, the following sets of primers were used: MW-4: [(nt 1119) 5'-CCTGCTCCTGAGGACG-3' (nt 1134)] and MW-AS(R-W): [(nt 1674) 5'-CTTCAGATGGTCGGACCAGGAAAACTTTC-3' (nt 1642)], as well as MW-F: [(nt 1777) 5'-GGCGGACCAATTCGTC-3' (nt 1762)] and MW-S(R-W): [(nt 1645) 5'-CGAAAGII I ICCTGGTCCGACCATCTGAAG-3' (nt 1674)]. The nucleotide numbering scheme is based on the sequence of Buckler et al. (1991). The bold nucleotides indicate the changes made at the nucieotide sequence level to result in conversion of the arginine codon to a tryptophan codon. Oligonucleotidas MW-4 and MW-AS(R-W) as well as MW-F and MW-S(R-W) were used in the PCR with pKS/mWT[-/ - ] as template. Annealing reactions were performed at 57°C in the presence of PerfectMatch. The two resulting PCR products were gel purified from a 30/o NuSieve gel (Langridge et al., 1980), mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, and ,'~0.1 rig used in a second PCR using oligonucleotides MW-F and MW-4. The resultant product was gel purified, restricted with Bsu361 and BssHII, and subcloned into pKS/mWT[-/-], which had been restricted with BssHII and Bsu361. Colonies were analyzed by direct sequencing to ensure against the introduction of second site mutations during the PCR. The same strategy was employed to construct the ~Asp to ~Asn mutation, except that oligonucleotides MW-4 and MW-F were used in combination with MW-AS(D-N): [(nt 1674) 5'-C'I-I'CAGATGGTTGGACCGGGAAAACTTTC-3' (nt 1642)] and MWS(D-N): [(nt 1645) 5'-CGAAAG i i i I CCCGGTCCAACCATCTGAAG-3' (nt 1674)], respectively.  In Vitro Transcriptions and Translations The vectors pKS/mWT[-/-], pKS/WT1 (~W), and pKS/W'I'I(~N) were used as starting reagents to construct vectors with greater translational efficiencies. The WT1 gene was excised from these plasmids as follows. Each vector was digested with Spel, which cuts upstream of the WT gene, and within the polylinker of pBluescript II KS+. This was filled in with DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) in the presence of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, and blunt-end Ugated to EcoRI linkers (5'-GGAAI-ICC-3~ using T4 DNA ligase. This mixture was then digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and the resultant WT gene inserts were gel purified as previously described (Langridge et al., 1980). These inserts were then introduced into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pSP65-38A. This vector has been previously described (Munroe et al., 1990) and was constructed by inserting 38 adenosines into the Pstl site of the pSP65 polylinker. Any resultant synthetic mRNA species made with SP6 polymerase on template linearized with Hindlll will therefore contain a poly(A) tail, a feature important for mRNA stability and translation (Munroe et al., 1990). The resultant plasmids were referred to as pSP65(A)/mWT[-/-], pSP65(A)/WT1(~W), and pSP65 (A)/WTI(~N). For in vitro transcriptions, these plasmids were linearized with Hindlll. A control plasmid, p327, contains a 2.1 kb EGR-1 cDNA in the Smal site of pBluescript II KS. This plasmid was linearized with Xbal. After digestion, samples were phenol-chloroform (1:1; v/v) extracted, passed over a G-50 spun-dialysis column, and ethanol precipitated. Transcription reactions using pSP65 derivatives as template were carried out according to Green st al. (1983), except for the following modifications: 500 p.M m7GpppG was included in the reaction mix, and the GTP concentration was lowered to 100 p.M in order to synthesize capped mRNA transcripts. Ten microcurias of 5-3H-CTP was included in the reaction mix to be used as tracer to quantitate mRNA yields.  Cell 446  Incubation times were 2 hr at 40°C. T3 transcriptions (Promega Biotech) using p327 were according to the manufacturer's recommendations with the above noted modifications. RNA templates were translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (50 p_l) (Promega Biotech) in the presence or absence of [35S]methionine at final concentrations of 16 p.g/ml. Unlabeled proteins were synthesized in lysates supplemented with 20 p.M methionine. Translations were performed at 30°C for 1 hr.  Gel Retardation Assay Probes for the binding assay were prepared by annealing complementary synthetic oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides were gel purified after synthesis and annealed by heating to 90°C for 5 min in 50 mM Tris HCI (pH 7.6), 10 mM MgCI2, 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 75 mM NaCI and allowed to slowly cool to room temperature. Annealed oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [7-32P]ATP and purified from a 3°/o NuSieve gel as previously described (Langridge et al., 1980). The binding sites used were as follows: EGR, 5'-CGCCCTCGCCCCCGCGCCGGG-3' and M2, 5'-CGCCCTCGCACCCGCGCCGGG-3'. Binding reactions for the gel retardation assay were set up in 10 p.I by incubating 2.5 ng of end-labeled probe (20,000 cpm) and 1 p_g of poly(dl-dC)-poly(dl-dC) with 3 p_lof EGR-1 or WTI programmed lysate. The binding buffer was 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 70 mM KCI, 5 mM MgCI2, 0.1% NP-40, 12% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 100 p.M ZnCI2. Each reaction mixture was preincubated at room temperature for 15 rain before the addition of radiolabeled probe. Complexes were given 15 rain at room temperature to form and were resolved on a 5O/o polyacrylamide gel (30:1) in 0.5 x TBE (1 x TBE is 0.089 M Tris-borate, 0.089 M boric acid, 2 mM EDTA) at 140 V at 4°C. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-ray film at -70°C. For competition experiments, the specific amount of cold oligonucleotide competitor was added to the lysate concurrent with the addition of labeled DNA.

"1","© 1991 Nature Publishing Group  © 1991 Nature Publishing Group  © 1991 Nature Publishing Group  HYPERKALAEMIC periodic paralysis (HYPP) is an autosomal dominant disease that results in episodic electrical inexcitability and paralysis of skeletal muscle. Electrophysiological data indicate that tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channels from muscle cells of HYPP-affected individuals show abnormal inactivation. Genetic analysis of nine HYPP families has shown tight linkage between the adult skeletal muscle sodium channel alpha-subunit gene on chromosome 17q and the disease (lod score, z = 24; recombination frequency 0 = 0), strongly suggesting that mutations of the alpha-subunit gene cause HYPP. We sequenced the alpha-subunit coding region isolated from muscle biopsies from affected (familial HYPP) and control individuals by cross-species polymerase chain reaction-mediated complementary DNA cloning. We have identified an A----G substitution in the patient's messenger RNA that causes a Met----Val change in a highly conserved region of the alpha-subunit, predicted to be in a transmembrane domain.

DNA markers within this interval revealed a duplication that is completely linked and associated with CMTl A. The duplication was demonstrated in affected individuals by the presence of three alleles at a highly polymorphic locus, by dosage differences at RFLP alleles, and by two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA from patients of different ethnic origins showed a novel Sacll fragment of 500 kb associated with CMTlA. A severely affected CMTIA offspring from a mating between two affected individuals was demonstrated to have this duplication present on each chromosome 17. We have demonstrated that failure to recognize the molecular duplication can lead to misinterpretation of marker genotypes for affected individuals, identification of false recombinant!% and incorrect localization of the disease locus. Introduction Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is an inherited peripheral neuropathy in humans with involvement of both the motor and sensory nerves (Charcot and Marie, 1886; Lupski et al., 1991) and a prevalence rate of 1 in 2500 (Skre, 1974). Most families demonstrate autosomal dominant Mendelian segregation, although autosomal recessive and X-linked forms of the disease have been reported (McKusick, 1990). The most common form of the disease,  CMT type 1 (CMTl), is characterized by distal muscle atrophy, decreased nerve conduction velocities (NCV), and a hypertrophic neuropathyon nerve biopsy. CMTl is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease, the clinical expression of which is age dependent and the penetrance of which is nearly complete (Bird and Kraft, 1978). The average age at onset of clinical symptoms is 12.2 + 7.3 years. Recent studies provide convincing evidence that abnormal NCV (<40 m/s) is highly diagnostic of CMTl and is a 100% penetrant phenotype that is essentially independent of age (Lupski et al., 1991). CMTl displays marked clinical variability both within and between families, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. Since the molecular basis of this disorder is unknown, linkage studies are indispensable for mapping the gene(s) responsible for CMTl and to ascertain whether multiple genes, multiple alleles, or both lead to the clinical variation in symptoms. Genetic linkage studies in large pedigrees (see Lupski et al., 1991, for review) suggest the existence of at least three distinct loci causing CMTl: the CMTlA locus maps to human chromosome 17 (region pl I-~12) (Vance et al., 1989; Raeymakers et al., 1989; MiddletonPrice et al., 1990; Timmerman et al., 1990; McAlpine et al., 1990; Chance et al., 1990; Pate1 et al., 1990a, 1990b; Vance et al., 1991); the CMTlB locus maps to human chromosome 1 (region q23-q25) (Bird et al., 1982); and a third type is unlinked to both the CMTlA and CMTIB loci (Chance et al., 1990). These studies provide the basis for isolating the disease gene(s) by virtue of map position. Positional cloning experiments can be aided by the existence of patients with specific chromosomal DNA rearrangements. However, no chromosomal anomaly, indicative of genomic DNA rearrangement, has been described in CMTlA patients. We have now identified a DNA duplication in CMTlA. By a series of molecular and genetic methods, we demonstrate complete linkage and association of this duplication in seven multigenerational CMTlA pedigrees and in several isolated, unrelated patients. The DNA duplication is transmitted to affected offspring without recombination, but failure to recognize this duplication leads to incorrect interpretation of the marker genotypes of affected individuals and an incorrect localization of the disease gene. The discoveryof this DNA rearrangement is an important step toward the identification of the gene(s) involved by positional cloning and has implications for disease diagnosis in individuals without a firm family history. Our findings implicate a local DNA duplication, a segmental trisomy, as a novel mechanism for an autosomal dominant human disease. Results RFLP and Family Studies Seven large families segregating autosomal dominant CMTI , as evidenced by vertical male-to-male transmission, were identified. Six of these families, HOUl (Pate1 et al., 199Oa), HOU2, HOU42 (Pate1 et al., 1990b), HOU85,  Cdl 220  v-  HOUI  ABE CE ABE  ATE A’B’CAiD Ah  AB tl (21) II?

Standard pedigree symbols are used; disease is indicated by the darkened symbols. The laboratory identification number andthe (GT), genotype of each individual are indicated below the-pedigree symbols. (GT). genotypes were obtained by PCR analysis and were scored for the number of visible alleles using a standardized coding system: A = 165 bp, B = 163 bp, C = 161 bp, D = 159 bp, E = 157 bp, F = 155 bp, G = 153 bp. When a single allele was evident in an individual, it was scored as being present in two copies. Data were scored blind to disease status, and scoring was confirmed by two other investigators. Careful inspection of the relative intensity of the Mendelian inheritance of each allele was conducted to avoid scoring of shadow bands as alleles. The number of alleles evident in an affected individual depends on the number of distinguishable alleles segregating in the parents. In cases where all four parental chromosomes can be distinguished (e.g., unaffected father 1-49 genotype FG and affected mother 1-9 genotype ABC), the three alleles in the affected sons (l-153 and I-37ABG; 1-38 ABF) can be easily visualized. On the other hand, in HOU76 the affected father 76-270, with genotype BCE, and his unaffected spouse, 76-271, with genotype DE have an affected  DNA Duplication 221  Table  Mutation  1.

To accurately map the CMTl A gene in these pedigrees, 17 DNA polymorphisms localized to the proximal region of chromosome 17p and a highly polymorphic marker on chromosome 1q were studied. In view of the demonstrated genetic heterogeneity, we required that each family provide independent evidence of linkage to a specific chromosomal region. Initial linkage analysis was restricted to the large families HOUl, HOU2, HOU42, HOU85, and HOU89 (Figure 1). Families HOU76 and HOU88 were too small to include or exclude linkage to a specific location but were useful in the association study described below. The pooled evidence for linkage (LOD scores) from all five pedigrees, the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination value (4) between CMTl and various genetic markers, and the peak LOD scores (2) for nine loci are shown in Table 1. The immunoglobulin receptor FcyRll on chromosome Iq shows complete linkage to C,MTl in a large Indiana kindred (R. Lebo, personal communication) and is diagnostic of CMTlB. None of our families show linkage to FcyRll (6 = 0.5,i = 0.0, Table 1). Individually, each pedigree showed negative LOD scores (data not shown), and together these families exclude linkage to a region 20 recombination units (0 = 0.20) on either side of FcrRII. Linkage analysis was performed using the 17p probes LEW301, YNM67R5, 1516, AlO-41, S6.1-HB2, 1517, MYH2, and 1541. All markers except 1541 showed LOD scores exceeding 3.0 (Table l), and all loci except MYHP and 1541 showed recombination values of 4.6% or less, demonstrating tight linkage of the disease to the 17p region. Each individual family, except HOU42, showed a LOD score of 3.0 or greater with one or more DNA markers in this region (data not shown); HOU42 showed a peak LOD score of 2.9 at i? = 6 with the DNA probe YNM67-R5.  e o.500 0.000 0.023 0.000 0.035 0.046 0.013 0.180 0.222  2 0.00 14.74 9.68 15.89 10.35 12.70 15.84 3.58 2.72  Statistical tests on all the marker data suggested that the disease locus in these families mapped to the same location on chromosome 17p and segregated CMTl A. For further confirmation, we calculated the peak multipoint LOD score for each family, including HOU42, with respect to the map LEW301 -YNM67-R5-Al0-41 -MYHP using the computer program CRI-MAP; these LOD scores were 6.27,3.79,3.98,4.28, and 4.84for HOUl, HOU2, HOU42, HOU85, and HOU89, respectively, and confirmed their classification as CMTlA families. The DNA probes MYH2 and 1541, located on distal chromosome 17p, demonstrated loose linkage to CMT; consequently, multiple recombinants between the disease and these markers are observed in each family. On the other hand, only five recombinants were detected for the markers closely linked to CMTl A. Of these, LEW301 and 1516 show no recombinants. However, individual 89-401 in HOU89 is recombinant for YNM67-R5, individual 85-326 in HOU85 is recombinant for AlO-41 and S6.1-HB2 (same event detected), individual 1-13 in HOUl is recombinant for S6.1-HB2, and individual 2-448 and one of the spouses of 2-439 in HOU2 are recombinant for 1517. The order of the closely linked 17p DNA probes is LEW301 -(YNM67R5, 1516)-(AlO-41, S6.1-HB2)-1517 and covers a distance of 9.9 CM. The five families contain approximately 108 meioses, which for the LEW301-1517 interval should contain 9.7 f 3.1 recombinants. The observed number of recombinants (5) is well within expectations (x2 = 2.30, 1 degree of freedom, P > 0.10). These recombinants suggest that CMTlA is localized between LEW301 and 1517, which corresponds to an interval of approximately 10 million bp, assuming that recombination is uniform in the human genome. In the following section we report isolation of a highly informative (CT), polymorphism that detects multiple alleles in CMTl A patients. Genotypes at this locus are also provided in Figure 1.  son, 76-272, of apparent genotype BE, but shows a double dose for allele E. Since dosage differences were not always reproducible from PCR, we scored absolute number of alleles visualized on the autoradiograph. The disease status of all at-risk individuals was determined by NCV measurements with the exception of individuals 1-45, l-46, l-47, l-72, l-73, and l-74, who were diagnosed by clinical examination only. Note the nuclear family of individuals 42-331, 42-332, 42-333, where a mating occurs between two affected individuals. CMTIA segregates with the alleles A and E in HOU2, HOU42, and HOU88, with alleles A and B in HOUl, with alleles C and D in HOU85 and HOU89, and with alleles B and E in HOU76.  Cell 222  HOU88  DIE DiE E/AE EIAEUAE Bit  WAE  HOU76  Bgiii&iF  352 353 C/C B/C CBE B/C CisE CBE C/BE  Figure 2. Detection Patients  of Three  Alleles with the Marker  RMI I-GT in CMT  (GT), genotypes obtained by PCR analysis were scored as described in the legend to Figure 1. The genotypes are indicated below the pedigrees, with the slash indicating the pair of alleles segregating with CMTlA in each nuclear family. Shadow bands that differ from the primary bands in size by multiples of 2 bases are invariably seen with dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms; however, even without special precautions it is possible to read the genotypes unambiguously (Weber, 1990). (A) represents a nuclear family where CMTIA patients 66-336 and 66-340 exhibit three (GT), alleles. The patients 88-339 and 86-380 are partially informative with respect to the number of (GT), alleles, but the higher intensity of allele E in each of these patients suggests a double dose for this allele. (6) shows inheritance of three alleles in CMT patients from a nuclear family of Ashkenazic Jewish descent, in contrast to the other families, which are of French-Acadian descent.  A (GT). Polymorphism at the Dl7Sl22 Locus Demonstrates a Duplication Associated with CMTIA We screened CMTl A-linked 17p DNA probes for the presence of simple sequence repeats such as (GT),, which are known to be highly polymorphic and can be rapidly analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Weber and May, 1989; Litt and Luty, 1989). (CT), sequences were identified in several probes, one of which, RMl I-GT, was identified from VAW409Rl located at the Dl7S122 locus (Wright et al., 1990). This marker maps to 17p11.2-pl2 and is also closely linked to CMTIA (Vance et al., 1991). The five large French-Acadian pedigrees segregating CMTlA and the two small kindreds of French-Acadian (HOUSS) and Ashkenazic Jewish (HOU76) descent were genotyped for RMl l-GT. Genotype data from two nuclear CMTIA families within HOU88 and HOU76 are shown in Figure 2. These data demonstrate a striking observation:  six of eight CMTIA individuals show three (CT), alleles (e.g., individuals 88-340, 76-352), but all unaffected individuals are either homozygous or heterozygous for (GT). alleles. In certain matings, only two (GT), alleles were segregating and thus only two (CT), alleles could be detected in the affected child. However, careful examination of the autoradiograph often revealed that one of the two (CT), alleles was present in two copies (e.g., 88-339, 88-380 in Figure 2A). These data indicate that CMTIA patients of French-Acadian (Figure 2A) and Ashkenazic Jewish (Figure 2B) descent have three copies of the Dl7Sl22 locus, suggesting a duplication of this locus in CMTlA patients. Genotypes for RMI I-GT for all seven CMTl A pedigrees are shown in Figure 1 and demonstrate that three RMI lGT alleles are present only in affected individuals and are never observed in 53 unaffected offspring and 31 unaffected spouses. The transmission of this duplication is also highly specific. By considering all completely informative RMI l-GT matings, such as ABC x DE, we observed 45 cases of transmission of the duplicated allele from affected parents to affected offspring and 18 cases where the affected parent transmitted a single allele to their normal offspring. In these matings, none of the unaffected offspring received the duplicated DNA segment and none of the affected offspring received a single allele from the affected parent. Thus, in 63 fully informative meioses the duplication was faithfully transmitted to the affected offspring and without recombination with the normal chromosome (LOD score, 2 = 18.96 at r!r = 0.0).  Dosage Differences at an Mspl RFLP Detected by Probe VAW409R3 at the Dl7Sl22 Locus Confirm the CMTI A-Specific Duplication The demonstration of three copies of D175122 in CMTlA patients by (CT), allele analysis led us to examine the dosage of polymorphic Mspl alleles at this locus. Two Mspl restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) are detected by the marker D17Sl22 (Wright et al., 1989; Vance et al. 1991) by Southern blot analysis using 11 kb (VAW409Rl) and 2.1 kb EcoRl (VAW409R3) subclones of phage VAW409 as standard two- and three-allele RFLPs, respectively. Dosage differences that followed Mendelian inheritance were observed in CMTIA patients using the probe VAW409R3, as shown in Figure 3. The Mspl genotypes in a nuclear family of pedigree HOU85 are shown in Figure 3A. The unaffected father (85-301) has genotype BB, and his unaffected daughters (85-326 and 85-312) have genotype AB The affected mother (85-302) and her affected sons (85-303 and 85-304) also have genotype AB, but inspection of the autoradiograph shows clear dosage differences between the two alleles such that 85-302, 85-303, and 85-304 have genotypes AAB, ABB, and ABB, respectively. The VAW409R3 genotypes in Figure3Aalsoshowthat theCMT1 Achromosome harbors both an A and a B allele and that the AB combination segregates in a Mendelian fashion. Comparative Southern analysis of eight unrelated CMTlA patients (Figure 3C) and control individuals (Figure 3D) with the probe VAW409R3 is also shown.

Note the difference in the relative intensity of alleles A and B in CMT patients (85-302, 85-303, 85-304) versus unaffected individuals (85-301, 85-312, 85-326). (B) Southern analysis with a probe from outside the duplication region. The Southern blot from BC AA AC AB AC AB D B (A) was rehybridized with the control probe 10-5, representing the myosin heavy chain locus in 17p13(Schwartzet al., 1986; Nakamura et al., 1988). No difference in the intensity of the polymorphic alleles was noted. (C) Southern analysis of Mspl-digested genomic DNA from eight unrelated CMTlA patients 2.6 - ConsIant with the probe VAW409R3 (D17S122). Note the presence of three polymorphic alleles in lanes l-3. This genotype clearly illustrates the duplication, but was observed in only 3 of 131 CMTlA patients. Lanes 4-8 show individuals who had two polymorphic alleles and in whom a duplication could be discerned by noting the difference in the relative intensity of one ,allele when compared to that of the other allele. This Southern blot was rehybridized with a control VNTR probe, YNH24 from chromosome 2 (Nakamura et al., 1987), and showed no difference in the intensity of the polymorphic alleles (data not shown). (D) Southern analysis of Mspl-digested genomic DNA from eight control individuals with the probe VAW409R3. Note the lack of dosage difference between alleles in all individuals. 303 304 326 312  common examples of informative CMTlA individuals are shown in lanes 4-6 (genotype ABB) and lanes 7 and 8 (genotype AAB). The presence of an extra allele can be noted in individuals of AAB and ABB genotypes by comparing the ratio of the hybridization signal for one allele to the other. Lanes l-3 in Figure 3C represent CMTlA individuals who were fully informative for the RFLP and demonstrated three polymorphic alleles resulting in a genotype ABC. Three copies of the allele could also be noted in affected individuals of genotype AAA or BBB when the signal from a control probe was used for normalization (data not shown). To confirm this observation, 103 CMTlA patients from seven families (Figure 1) as well as 26 other unrelated patients were examined by Southern blot analysis with VAW409R3. Dosage of alleles was determined by visual examination and densitometry of autoradiographs or by quantitation of total radioactivity in each allele using a Betascope analyzer (Sullivan et al., 1987). Dosage was determined only in individuals who were heterozygous for the RFLP since the results were most reproducible and reliable in such cases. Seventy-six CMTl A patients were heterozygous for this RFLP and were conclusively demonstrated to have three copies of the D17S122 locus. In contrast, none of 63 controls (27 unaffected at-risk individuals with normal NCV and 36 controls with no family history of CMT) who were heterozygous for this marker showed dosage differences for this RFLP, suggesting that the genotype with dosage differences was specific to CMTlA patients (x2 = 48.72; P < 1 Om5).Similar dosage differences were observed with the marker VAW409Rl (data not shown).  Demonstration of Two (GT). Alleles in Mspl Fragments Showing Dosage Differences We next demonstrated that the Mspl allele8 present in two copies by dosage differences in CMTlA patients contain two (CT), alleles, using preparative gel separation of the polymorphic alleles (Bedford and van Helden, 1990). Mspl alleles revealed by VAW409Rl (Di 7S122) showing dosage differences in CMTlA patients, and from which the marker RM 11 -GT was derived, were separated on agarose gels and used as templates for PCR amplification of RMl l-GT. The analysis required affected individuals to have three distinguishable (GT), alleles and that these individuals be heterozygous for the Mspl RFLP. Figure 4A displays representative data from a nuclear family within kindred HOU42. The unfractionated genomic DNA from these individuals as well as their separated Mspl allelic fractions were genotyped for RMl l-GT. Figure 48 indicates that in each instance, a patient with a polymorphic allele of double intensity had two (CT), alleles, whereas a single (CT)” allele was evident in the other polymorphic allele showing normal intensity in the patients and in all unaffected individuals. Homozygosity for the Duplication Mutation in a Severely Affected Individual A severe clinical phenotype has been previously reported in an individual who was the product of a consanguineous mating between first cousins affected with CMT and hypothesized to represent homozygous expression of adominant gene for CMT (Killian and Kloepfer, 1979). A Small nuclear family within pedigree HOU42 (Figure 1) demonstrated a mating between two affected individuals.

The RFLP genotypes based on dosage of alleles are indicated at the top of the autoradiograph. Measurement of total counts in each band using the Betascope analyzer (Sullivan et al., 1987) confirmed this visually determined genotype. Note that the affected individuals 42-218 and 42-225 have two copies of the A allele and one copy of the B allele. Examination of Mendelian inheritance in this kindred indicated that the disease segregates with the alleles AB. (B) An agarose gel similar to that in (A) was prepared, and the regions corresponding to alleles A and B, respectively, were cut out and the allelic fractions genotyped for (GT), alleles as described in Experimental Procedures. The products obtained with undigested DNA from each individual are shown in the lanes identified by the identification number of the individual, and those obtained from the corresponding A and B alleles are shown in the lanes marked A and B. Note that the A allele of individual 42-218 and 42-225, which is present in two copies, shows two (GT), alleles while all other alleles are present in a single copy and show one (GT), allele.  the two affected offsprings of this mating (42-333) demonstrated a severe clinical phenotype including early onset (<1 year) and markedly reduced motor NCV (ml 0 m/s vs. affected 20-40 m/s; unaffected >40 m/s). Examination of the segregation of 17p markers in HOU42 demonstrated that individual 42-333 had inherited two CMTlA chromosomes. The (GT), alleles A and E segregate with CMTlA in the families of both the affected mother and affected father. The (CT)” genotype of individual 42-333 is AE and suggests that she inherited a CMTlA chromosome from each of her parents. Her sister, 42-332, has inherited one chromosome with the duplication genotype AE and has a less severe clinical phenotype. For further confirmation, somatic cell hybrids retaining individual chromosome 17 homologs from patient 42-333, her affected mother (42-331), and her affected sister (42-  Figure 5. Demonstration Analysis of Chromosome brids  of a Homozygous CMTlA Patient 17 Homologs Separated in Somatic  by (GT), Cell Hy  The chromosomes 17 of patients 42-332 and 42-333, offspring of a mating between two affected individuals, and of their affected mother, 42-331, were isolated in somatic cell hybrids as described in Experimental Procedures. Positive clones from each fusion were screened for the identity of the chromosome(s) 17 retained by PCR analysis of the cell lysate with primers to a polymorphic marker within the gene for the 0 subunit of the muscle acetylcholine receptor locus in 17~. Lysates from clones retaining each of the two chromosome 17 homologs were analyzed for the (GT), polymorphism at the D17S122 locus. The results of this analysis are shown in (A), where the numbered lanes referto the productsobtained from the respective patients’ DNA and the letters a and b identify lanes showing amplification products from the corresponding pair of hybrids, each retaining a chromosome 17 homolog from the respective patient. (6) shows the amplification products obtained with primers from the acetylcholine receptor 8 subunit gene polymorphic locus in 17p outside the duplication region using DNA from patients 42-332 and 42-333 and the corresponding hybrids illustrating the successful separation of the chromosome 17 homologs. The disease segregates with the (GT), alleles A and E in the families of both the mother and the father of patient 42-333, who is homozygous for the disease chromosome. The pedigree symbols reflect the scoring of the genotype with respect to the disease allele.  332) were constructed. These hybrids were genotyped for RMl I-GT, and the results are shown in Figure 5A. They confirm the following: first, patients 42-331 and 42-332 are heterozygous for the chromosome carrying the duplication; and second, patient 42-333 is homozygous for the duplication, and each chromosome 17 homolog contains two copies of the Dl7Sl22 locus. This nuclear family lends support to the hypothesis that the duplication is responsible for the clinical phenotype of CMTlA and that CMTlA is a semidominant mutation, since homozygosity for the duplication results in a more severe clinical phenotype. PFGE Analysis Identifies a Novel Sacll Fragment in CMTlA Patients To define this duplication more precisely and obtain an estimate of its size, we performed long-range restriction mapping using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (Schwartz and Cantor, 1984). The restriction enzymes Notl, Mlul, Sacll, and Nrul were used to digest DNA from  DNA Duplication 225  Mutation  Associated  with CMTlA  similarsize in CMTl Apatientsof kenazic Jewish origin.

Approximately one-fifth of each plug (4 ug of DNA) was digested with Sacll and electrophoresed in a CHEFII-DR PFGE apparatus (Bio-Rad) for 24 hr in 0.5 x TBE buffer using pulse times of 50-90 s ramp at 200 V. The Southern blot was hybridized with the probe VAW409R3 as described (Pate1 et al., 199Oa) with the exception that 0.5 mglml human placental DNA was used for preassociation of repeats in the probe. The patients used were individual 76-270, 76-272, 42-332, 42-333, and 42-266 in lanes 1 through 5, respectively. The additional PFGE fragment of approximately 350 kb in patient 76-272 is sometimes faintly visible in other lymphoblastoid cell lines and may represent a methylation artifact. It does not demonstrate Mendelian inheritance. Note that lane 4 shows the pattern for the homozygous patient 42-333. (B) PFGE plugs were prepared from lymphocytes isolated from the whole blood of related affected and unaffected individuals. They were digested with Sacll and electrophoresed, and the resulting Southern blot was hybridized as described above. Note the Mendelian inheritance of the novel 500 kb Sacll allele in affected individuals.  affected and control individuals to identify altered and/or novel fragments in CMTlA patients. Two Sacll fragments of 600 kb and 550 kb, which are either polymorphic alleles or variants arising as a result of methylation differences, were seen in 16 control individuals using VAW409R3 as a probe (Figure 6A, lanes 6-l 2, and further data not shown). However, a novel 500 kb Sacll fragment was seen in CMTlA patients of French-Acadian and Ashkenazic Jewish origin (Figure 6A), and this Sacll fragment showed Mendelian inheritance (Figure 6B). These results suggest the presence of a large genomic DNA rearrangement of  French-Acadian  andAsh-  FISH Analysis Reveals a Duplication in Nuclei of CMTlA Patients Two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in interphase nuclei (Lawrence et al., 1990; Trasket al., 1991) provided direct visualization of duplication of the VAW409 locus in CMTlA patients. VAW409 and a control probe from 17~11.2 (~1516) were hybridized in a blind study to nuclei from CMTlA patients 2-440 and 42-331 and unaffected controls 42-289 and 76-271. The hybridization sites of VAW409 and cl516 were labeled with red and green fluorochromes, respectively. Because DNA replication can result in double hybridization signals in interphase, cl516 was included to identify cells that contained only two single hybridization sites for this probe and, therefore, had not replicated the CMTlA region. A total of three red VAW409 sites (two near one of the cl516 sites and one paired with the second cl516 site) were observed in the majority of these cells ,from the CMTlA patients (60% and 59% in 2-440 and 42-331, respectively) but in few cells from unaffected individuals (3% and 6% in 42-289 and 76-271, respectively). In contrast, only one VAW409 hybridization site was paired with each single cl516 site in the majority of cells from unaffected individuals (90% and 79% in 42-289 and 76-271, respectively). The nuclei from the homozygous patient 42-333 were similarly subjected to FISH analysis and demonstrated a total of four red VAW409 sites, two paired with each green cl 516 site (Figure 7). Lymphoblasts from an additional three CMTl A patients and four control individuals, for a total of six patients including one from the Ashkenazic Jewish family and six controls, were included in a blind study to determine the relative number of hybridization sites of VAW409 and ~1516. In each case, the presence of a duplicated region in CMTlA patients was confirmed. This study demonstrates that duplications can be readily detected in interphase nuclei using FISH. Consequences of the Duplication on Linkage Analysis for CMTlA Gene Localization Genetic mapping in the CEPH reference families (Dausset, 1986) localizes probe VAW409 between A10-41 and MYH2 at a distance of 1.3 CM from AlO-41. In Table 2, LOD scores between CMTl A and polymorphisms detected by probe VAW409 are presented. When scored as disomic allelic systems, the recombination value between CMTlA and VAW409R3 is 7.3% and surprisingly higher than the other closely linked CMTlA markers. There were six recombinants with this probe, three each in families HOU85 (85312,85-320,85-326) and HOU89 (89-342,89-343, and 89-344). These recombinants were surprising since they were clustered and greater in number than the five previously detected with other 17p markers spanning 9.9 CM. The observation of dosage differences detected by VAW409 clarified not only the occurrence of a DNA duplication, but also that failure to account for this duplication in linkage analyses produces false recombinants. This important phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 8A  Cell 226  Figure 7. FlSHAnalysisof Individuals with VAW409  Interphase and cl516  Nuclei from CMTlAand  spring from a BB x AB mating is in itself a low probability event [P = 0.002].) Dosage differences suggest instead that the affected mother’s genotype is AAB, with the mutant gene-bearing chromosome containing the two alleles AB. The six affected offspring have genotype ABB based on dosage, while the three unaffected offspring have genotype AB. Consequently, the affected parent transmitted the AB and A alleles to her affected and unaffected offspring, respectively, and no recombinants are evident. A similar situation pertains to the three clustered recombinants in pedigree HOU89. The VAW409R3 data were recoded as trisomic allele systems and the data reanalyzed by linkage analysis. This analysis (Table 2) based on dosage (VAW409R3d) shows no recombination between this marker and CMTlA at a LOD score of 31.08 (Table 2) in 103 informative meioses. Similarly, a second Mspl RFLP detected by the DNA probe VAW409Rl also demonstrates dosage differences and recombination with CMTl A; taking dosage into account, this probe (VAW409Rld) shows complete linkage to CMTlA at a LOD score of 17.56 in 58 informative meioses. The genotypes for RMI l-GT were also used for linkage analysis. CMTlA in these pedigrees shows complete linkage to RMl 1-GT at a LOD score of 36.74, with no recombinants being evident in 122 informative meioses. Individually, each family showed peak LOD scores of 3.0 or greater, except HOU76 (2 = 2.01) and HOU88 (2 = 2.19); these latter families have seven informative meioses each. Thus, taking dosage differences into account at VAW409R1, VAW409R3, and RMl 1-GT, locus D17S122 shows complete linkage to CMTlA. Multipoint linkage analysis of CMTlA using the map AlO-41-(1.3 CM)-RMll-GT-(11.7 CM)-MYH2 was then performed using the program LINKAGE to calculate confidence limits on the location of CMTl A. The peak multipoint LOD score was 34.5; the CMTlA locus had the maximum likelihood position at RMl l-GT, between AlO41 and MYHP. All other intervals were excluded with odds of lO’*:l or greater. The approximate 95% confidence limits on the CMTlA location defined a 3 CM interval containing the probe RMll-GT. A more extensive analysis using the markers LEW301 -YNM67-R5-A10-41 -RMl lGT-MYHP and the program CRI-MAP verified the placement of CMTlA at locus RMll-GT and between the probes Al O-41 and MYH2 with odds exceeding 1OOO:l.  Normal  Four lymphoblastoid cell lines were analyzed in a blind study by FISH as described (Trask et al., 1991). Interphase nuclei preparations were hybridized simultaneously with biotinylated probes VAW409Rl and VAW409R3 and digoxigenin-labeled cosmid ~1516, which maps to 17~11.2. The hybridization sites of VAW409 and cl 516 were labeled with Texas red and fluorescein, respectively, and viewed together through a double band-pass filter. The hybridization pattern of cl516 was used as an internal assay for the replication status of the proximal 17p region. The nuclei shown are representative of the predominant hybridization pattern observed in each sample in terms of the relative number of red and green sites. The difference in the hybridization pattern of patient and control samples was not due to differences in hybridization efficiency; the fraction of nuclei lacking aVAW409 signal paired with one or both cl516 sites was similar in all cell lines (9%17%).

If dosage differences are ignored, the affected mother has genotype AB with the A chromosome carrying the CMTlA mutant gene; the unaffected father is BB. Since all nine offspring are AB but six are affected and three are unaffected, the unaffected individuals are recombinant. (Note that the segregation of nine AB off-  Table 2.

Shown below the pedigree symbol in descending order are the identification number of the individual and the VAW409R3 genotype scored without and with consideration of dosage of the alleles, respectively. Segregation of marker alleles demonstrates that individual 85-302 carries the A allele on the CMTlA chromosome if dosage is ignored but the AB allele on the CMTIA chromosome if dosage is considered. Individuals 85-312, 85-320, and 85-326 appear as recombinants with VAW409R3; however, VAW409R3d shows that this is due to misclassification. (B) Multipoint linkage mapping of CMTlA on a genetic map of chromosome 17~. The locus positions of the markers are indicated on the horizontal axis. The height of the curves represents the relative likelihood of location (LOD score) at any specified point along the map. When dosage differences are ignored (VAW409R3), the most likely position of the CMTlA gene is proximal to LEWBOI; however, the RMI I-GT locus data clearly place CMTlA at RMI I-GT.  Map (CM)  The failure to account for dosage differences at a twoallele RFLP in linkage analysis, when it exists, leads to misinterpretation of the parental origin of alleles, as shown in Figure 8A. These errors appear as multiple, clustered (within sibships) recombination events that reduce the LOD score and increase the recombination value between the disease and the marker. More importantly, when these errors are included, multipoint linkage analysis can seriously distort the positioning of the disease locus. This dramatic effect is shown in Figure 88, where we present the multipoint LOD score for CMTlA versus a fixed map of the markers LEW301 -YNM67-R5-AlO-41 -VAW409R3/ RMll-GT-1517-MYHP. Figure8Bshowsthemultipoint LOD score curve for two analyses using CRI-MAP that are identical except that VAW409 was first coded as a two-allele RFLP without dosage (VAW409R3) and a second time using the RMll-GT polymorphism. Using the (GT), polymorphism, the multipoint LOD score is 31.4 and correctly places the CMTlA locus at VAW409. The 95% confidence limits on the CMTIA location define a 3 CM interval around the (CT), locus. On the other hand, ignoring the duplication produces a peak LOD score of 26.81 and incorrectly places CMTlA 1 CM proximal to LEW301. The 95% confidence limits on this location define a 6 CM interval around LEW301. Not only do these two confidence intervals fail to overlap, but the two LOD scores have an odds difference of 104.6! Furthermore, the correct location of CMTI at VAW409 is 50 times less likely than the incor-  rect location when dosage at VAW409R3 is not scored. The misclassification leads to multiple recombination events with VAW409 and thus places the CMTlA locus toward LEW301, with which no recombinants were observed. Discussion We have demonstrated that CMTlA is associated with a DNA duplication using (GT), polymorphism and RFLP analysis, FISH analysis, and isolation of parental chromosomes in somatic cell hybrids. Three polymorphic markers at the D17S122 locus have displayed this duplication, namely, VAW409R3, VAW409R1, and RMI l-GT, and in each case there is a perfect correlation between the duplication genotype and the CMTlA disease phenotype. PFGE suggests that the duplication includes a large genomic region. We have shown that failure to understand the molecular nature of the polymorphism leads to the mislocalization of CMTlA and reduced evidence for linkage. Preliminary data by RFLP analysis and dosage of polymorphic alleles indicate that two additional markers, VAW412R3 (D17S125) and EW401 (D17S61) (Wright et al., 1990), which are linked to VAW409, may also be duplicated, while other CMTl A-linked markers do not appear to show evidence for duplication. The demonstration of an autosomal dominant inherited mutation involving DNA duplication in multiple families is  Cdl 228  unprecedented. Several linesof evidencesuggest thatthis duplication is responsible for the CMTlA phenotype. First, the duplication mutation was observed only in CMTlA patients and not observed in 63 control individuals. Second, the duplication was demonstrated in CMTlA patients of French-Acadian descent as well as Ashkenazic Jewish origin. Third, a severely affected offspring of a mating between two affected individuals was shown to be homozygous for the duplication. An important consequence of our study is the use of RMll-GT for CMTlA diagnosis. With the determination of dosage at the D17S122 locus in CMTlA patients, the positive predictive value of this DNA-based diagnostic test is likely to increase dramatically. Furthermore, the novel Sacll fragment observed by PFGE analysis as well as twocolor FISH of lymphoblasts or fresh lymphocytes may also be useful diagnostic methods for CMTl A. The availability of highly polymorphic markers similar to those demonstrated in this study from most regions of the human genome may enable the detection of segmental trisomy as the molecular basis for other human diseases The mechanism by which a duplication could result in the CMT phenotype is unknown, but possible mechanisms for the disease phenotype include the following: first, overexpression of one or more genes in the region (dosage effect); second, interruption of a candidate gene at the duplication junction leading either to an altered gene product with a dominant deleterious effect or to an absence of the gene product, thus resulting in decreased levels; third, occurrence of a stable dominant mutation in one of the duplicated candidate genes that results in a gene product with a deleterious effect; and fourth, a change in the physical location of the gene(s) within the duplication region, leading to altered regulation of gene expression, secondary to a position effect. The human gene for the b subunit of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor has recently been mapped to the 17p11.2-p12 region (Beeson et al., 1990). This receptor plays an important role in signal transduction at the neuromuscular junction. Using a highly polymorphic marker within this gene (OS1 -f3GT), we have demonstrated that it lies outside the duplication region (data not shown). However, the genes for the subunits of the neuronal acetylcholine receptor tend to locate in clustered arrays (Boulter et al., 1990). It is thus possible that altered expression of one or more of such receptor subunits could result in an altered stoichiometry of the subunits and lead to CMT. The mechanism by which theduplication mutation arose is unknown. De novo mutations that include deletions and duplications have been observed in the proximal region of the short arm of chromosome 17 (Smith et al., 1986; Stratton et al., 1986; Magenis et al., 1986). It is possible that the same recombination mechanisms that result in microdeletion on one chromosome homolog can result in duplication on the reciprocal homolog. Recent studies on chromosomal duplications in Escherichia coli and humans have demonstrated that duplication junctions occur in regions containing repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequences (Shyamala et al., 1990) as well as near Alu sequences (Kornreich et al., 1990; Devlin et al., 1990).  Mutations at the Bar locus in Drosophila melanogaster are gain of function and semidominant (Lindsley and Zimm, 1985) and are frequently associated with a tandem duplication of chromosome bands 16Al-A7 (Bridges, 1936). Recent molecular analysis has suggested that there is a transposable element (B104) located at the duplication junction. It has been proposed that this element is involved in the generation of the duplication. DNA sequencing analysis of the junctions of the B104 element support a model whereby the duplication is generated by a recombination event between two 8104 elements, one in 16Al and the other in 16A7 (Tsubota et al., 1989). A detailed analysis of the CMTlA duplicated region, particularly the duplication junctions, in CMTlA patients of varied ethnic origin may clarify the molecular mechanism for generating this dupliSome probable animal models for CMT are the mouse mutants trembler (Tr, dominant) (Falconer, 1951) and trembler-J (TrJ, semidominant) (Green, 1989). These mice exhibit a demyelinating neuropathy with decreased NCV similar to CMTl, and their mutations map to mouse chromosome 11, which is syntenic with human chromosome 17. It will be interesting to determine if the candidate disease locus is duplicated in these mice as in humans. Determination of the molecular basis of CMTlA will be possible by definition of the limits of the duplicated region, facilitated by identifying overlapping genomic clones that span the region and identifying candidate expressed sequences that map within the duplication. Ultimate confirmation of this finding may require expression of the candidate mutated region in transgenic mice and observation of the phenotype. Experimental  Procedures  Clinical Evaluation and Sampling of Families All available at-risk members of pedigrees were subjected to a thorough clinical and electrophysiological examination. In pedigree HOW, NCVs were initially determined only for clinically affected individuals. Further evaluation indicated that the clinically unaffected individuals l-13,1-37, and l-38 had abnormal NCVs; therefore, thediseasestatus of these individuals is different from that reported in the original pedigree (Pate1 et al., 1990a). In all other pedigrees at-risk individuals, whether clinically affected or unaffected, had motor NCVs determined. Diagnosis of CMTl wasestablished by slowed median and ulnar motor NCVs bilaterally (<40 m/s). A single normal motor NCV of the peroneal nerve excluded the diagnosis of CMTI in patients 5 years or older. Blood was collected from each participating family member, under informed consent, and used to establish EBV-transformed lymphoblasts (Anderson and Gusella, 1984) and for isolating high molecular weight DNA (Miller et al., 1988). The variable numbers of tandem repeat locus YNH24 (D2S44) (Nakamura et al., 1987a, 198713) in addition to the marker loci used in linkage analysis, were used to check parental origins for each individual in the seven pedigrees in Figure 1. Some parental exclusions were detected: these individuals were not incorporated in the linkage analysis. Linkage Analysis The chromosome 17~ markers comprise 17 standard RFLPs and were detected using nine DNA probes and Southern analysis as previously described (Pate1 et al., 1990a, 19906). The DNA probe FcTRll (chromosome lq) was studied by Southern analysis to exclude linkage to chromosome 1. LOD score analysis used two-point or multipoint methods (Morton, 1956; Ott, 1985; Lathrop and Lalouel, 1988) and the computer programs LINKAGE version 4.7 (Lathrop and Lalouel, 1988) and CRIMAP version 2.4 (Donis-Keller et al., 1987). CMTl was considered as  DNA Duplication 229  Mutation  Associated  with CMTlA  a fully penetrant autosomal dominant trait with a mutant gene frequency of 0.0001. The following markers, where alleles were codominant systems with frequencies as described in the literature, were used: LEW301 (D17858) (Fain et al., 1987); pA10-41 (D17S71) (Barker et al., 1987); pYNM87R5 (D17S29) (Ray et al., 1990); cl516 (D17S258) (Pate1 et al., 199Oa); p1516R4 (D175258) (Franc0 et al., 1990); pS6.1-HB2 (D17S445) (Pate1 et al., 1990b); cl517 (D17S259) (Pate1 et al., 1990a) Mspl allele lengths = 6.2/4.0/2.4 kb; cl541 (D17S260) (Pate1 et al., 1990a) Bglll allele lengths = 3.4/2.0 + 1.4 kb; Hindlll 14.0113.0 kb; BamHl 11.017.6 kb (allele lengths for probes cl517 and cl541 reflect changes from the original report); ~10-5 (MYH2) (Schwartz et al., 1986; Nakamura et al., 1988); VAW409R1, VAW409R3 (D17S122) (Wright et al., 1990); FcrRII, HFc3.0 (FCG2) (Hibbs et al., 1988; Grundy et al., 1989). Haplotypes were constructed for multiple DNA polymorphisms detected by the same DNA probe, except for VAW409, and assumed to be equifrequent, as were the alleles at RMl 1 -GT. For markers with five or more alleles, haplotypes were recoded into four-allele systems (Ott, 1978). LOD scores Z(6) at assumed recombination values (6) of 0.0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, and 0.40 were calculated for individual pedigrees and pooled. The maximum likelihood estimate of 8 (6) and the peak LOD score (Z = Z(6)) were estimated using the ILINK program in LINKAGE. Linkage was accepted if the LOD score was 3 or greater; the exclusion criterion was a LOD score of -2 (odds 1OO:l against linkage) at a specified recombination value. Approximate 95% confidence intervals on location were calculated by including all points on a map that have LOD scores at most one unit lower than the peak LOD score (Conneally et al., 1985). The x2 test of homogeneity (Morton, 1956) with 4 degrees of freedom was calculated for each of the eight 17~ DNA polymorphisms in Table 1. The x2 values ranged from 0.00 to 7.14 and were not statistically significant (P > 0.10). The order between the proximal chromosome 17~ markers was established by analyses of these markers in the CEPH (Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme Humain, Paris, France [Dausset, 1986)) reference families, and from analyses of somatic cell hybrids (Pate1 et al., 199Oa). The distances between adjacent markers in centimorgans were estimated from the CEPH panel (P. Fain, personal communication, 1991) except for 1517, whose distance from YNM67-R5 was estimated from thefiveCMTlA kindredsdescribed in this paper. The map is as follows: LEW301-2.6 CM-[YNM67-R5, 1516]-1.8 CM-[AlO-41, S6.1-HB2]1.3 CM-VAW409-4.2 CM-1517-7.5 CM-MYH2, where [ ] indicates markers for which the order is unknown. CRI-MAP is more efficient in likelihood calculations than LINKAGE, since it ignores population allele frequencies and the genotypes of specific individuals in analyses, In comparing the results of identical analyses in these five kindreds using both CRI-MAP and LINKAGE, a 20% information loss was observed for two-point LOD scores but only a 4% loss for multipoint LOD scores. For efficient calculations, only CRI-MAP was used for multipoint analysis. Detection of (GT). Polymorphic Markers and Genotype Determination (GT). repeat sequences were identified by Southern hybridization of dot blots of the plasmid or cosmid DNA to synthetic nick-translated poly(dC-dA).poly(dG-dl) (Pharmacia) using [@P]dCTP (New England Nuclear). Hybridizations were performed in 1 M NaCI, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate at 65OC, and the filters were washed at room temperature in 2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS. A (GT), repeat sequence was identified in an 11 kb EcoRl fragment cloned in pUCl8 (VAW409Rl). A 250 bp Haelll fragment contained the (GT), repeat and was further subcloned into pTZ19 (pRM1 l-GT) and sequenced by the dideoxy chain-termination method (Sanger et al., 1977) using the Sequenase Kit (United States Biochemical Corporation). The repeat sequence present in pRM1 l-GT was (TA),(GT),,(AT),. Analysis of 83 unrelated individuals identified at least eight different alleles, ranging in size from 153 bp to 167 bp, with an observed heterozygosity of 74%. For PCR amplification either the GT strand (CAGAACCACAAAATGTCTTGCATTC) or CA strand (GGCCAGACAGACCAGGCTCTGC) oligonucleotide primer flanking the (GT), repeat sequence was endlabeled at 37OC in a 15 ~1 reaction volume containing 1.2 9M primer, 100 &i of [y-32P]ATP at 6000 Cilmmol, 1 x One Phor-All Plus buffer (Pharmacia), and 10 U of polynucleotide kinase (Pharmacia). The ki-  nase was inactivated at 65OC for 10 min and the primer used directly in the PCR reaction (0.4 frl per reaction). PCR was performed using standard conditions in a 25 ~1 reaction volume in a mixture containing 1 PM each oligodeoxynucleotide primer, 250 NM each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 2.5 hl of 10x PCR buffer (500 mM KCI, 120 mM Tris-HCI [pH 8.0],1.5 mM MgCI,, and 0.01% gelatin), 0.63 U of AmpliTaq (Cetus) DNA polymerase, and 0.4 pl of end-labeled GT primer reaction mix. The amplification conditions were an initial denaturation at 94OC for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94OC denaturation for 1 min, 55OC annealing for 1 min, and 72OC extension for 2 min in an automated thermal cycler (Perkin-ElmerlCetus). Reaction products (1.5 ~1) were mixed with 2 al of formamide stop solution (United States Biochemical Corporation) and electrophoresed in a 8% polyacrylamide DNA sequencing gel at 40 W for 3.5 hr. Gels were dried and autoradiographed for 2-12 hr by exposure to Kodak XARQ film at  -70%. Southern Analysis and Dosage Determination Samples (5.5 frg) of genomic DNA were digested with 3-4 U of the appropriate restriction endonuclease under conditions specified by the manufacturer. A 0.5 pg aliquot was examined by gel electrophoresis to determine completeness of digestion. The digested DNAs were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel in 1 x TAE buffer (40 mM TrisHCI [pH 8.51, 40 mM sodium acetate, 2 mM EDTA) for *I6 hr. The DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Sureblot, Oncor) and hybridized to the probe after preassociation of repeats as described previously(Patel et al., 1990b). Dosageof alleles wasdetermined by visual inspection of autoradiographs and comparison of the intensity of one polymorphic allele to the other within each lane. Alternatively, such comparisons were made on autoradiographs using a densitometer (LKB Ultrascan) or by direct quantitation of radioactivity in the polymorphic alleles on the nylon membrane using the Betascope analyzer (Betagen) (Sullivan et al., 1987). Allele Separation for PCR Analysis Samples (5 Kg) of genomic DNA from members of a nuclear family in HOU42 were digested with Mspl and electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel in 1 x TAE buffer at 20 V overnight to allow separation of 3 kb and 6 kb alleles. The gel was sliced to isolate these fractions in a minimal volume, and the DNAwas purified using Geneclean (810101). Approximately 1130th of the isolated DNA was subjected to PCR analysis with the RMll-GT primers as described before. Construction and Analysis of Somatic Cell Hybrids Somatic cell hybrids were used to separate the maternal and paternal chromosomes 17 of individuals 42-331, 42-332, and 42-333. Hybrids were constructed as described by Zoghbi et al. (1989) using a23, a thymidine kinase-deficient Chinese hamster cell line (Westerveld et al., 1971) as the rodent parent. Briefly, two 100 mm plateswere seeded with 10’ a23 cells per plate 16-20 hr before fusion. The cells were washed with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM). To a 10 ml suspension of 5 x 10’ lymphoblasts in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (GIBCO), 250 ~1 of a 1 mg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Sigma) solution was added. Five milliliters of this cell suspension was added to each plate of a23 cells, and the plates were incubated for 15 min at 37°C. The solution was aspirated, and 2 ml of 50% polyethylene glycol 1500 (Eoehringer Mannheim Biochemicals) was spread over the surface of the plate. After 1 min the polyethylene glycol was aspirated, and the cells were washed three times with DMEM and incubated with 10 ml of DMEM for 30 min at 37°C. The medium was aspirated and the plates were incubated overnight with 10 ml of DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Hybrids were selected by growth in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 0.1 mM hypoxanthine, 0.001 mM aminopterin, and 0.01 mM thymidine. Hybrids were isolated with cloning rings IO-14 days later and transferred to 24-well microtiter plates. For analysis of the hybrids, cells from each confluent well were collected and lysed by boiling in 30 yl of 1 x PCR buffer. Three microliters of the lysate was used for PCR amplification with primers flanking a (GT), repeat (OSI-8GT) at the locus for the gene for the 8 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in 17~11.2. The sequence of the GT strand primer is AACTTTACTACAGGAGTTACACCC, and that of the CA strand primer is CTCGAGCCCCCGCATTCAAGAA. The PCR was conducted as described before using 3 ~1 of the cell lysate or  Cell 230  <lOO ng of separation comparison ing human  genomic DNA from the individual patients. The successful of the chromosome 17 homologs in hybrids was noted by of the (GT), allele in each hybrid to that of the correspondparent.  PFGE Lymphoblasts were used for preparation of plugs as described (Herrmann et al., 1987). Briefly, exponentially growing lymphoblasts were collected and counted using a hemacytometer. The cells were resuspended at 1 x 10’lml in lysis buffer I(O.l M EDTA, 0.02 M NaCI, 0.01 M Tris-HCI [pH 7.8]), and an equal volume of 1% lncert agarose (FMC Corporation) was added. The mixture was aliquoted into plug molds kept on ice. The plugs were suspended in lysis buffer II (lysis buffer I with 1.0% N-lauroylsarcosine and 2 mg/ml proteinase K). The digestion was carried out at 50°C for 48 hr. The plugs were dialyzed extensively against 10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5) 1 mM EDTA. Approximately one-fifth of each plug (4 ug of DNA) was digested with ~20 U of restriction endonuclease in a 150 PI volume and electrophoresed in a CHEFII-DR PFGE apparatus (Bio-Rad) for 24 hr in 0.5 x TBE buffer using pulse times of 50-90 s ramp at 200 V. The gel was transferred to a nylon membrane, and the Southern blot was hybridized with the probe VAW409R3 as described above with the exception that 0.5 mgl ml human placental DNA was used for preassociation of repeats in the probe. FISH Two-color FISH was performed as described previously (Trask et al., 1991). Briefly, VAW409Rl and VAW409R3 were combined and biotinylated using a nick translation kit (BRL). The cosmid cl516 was similarly labeled with digoxigenin (Boehringer Mannheim). The probes were mixed and hybridized to nuclei from post-log phase but unsynchronized lymphoblasts fixed on slides after hypotonic swelling and methanol-acetic acid fixation. After hybridization, hybridization sites of biotinylated and digoxigenin-labeled probes were labeled with Texas red and fluorescein, respectively, by sequential incubation of slides, alternated with wash steps, in avidin-Texas red; biotinylated goat anti-avidin and sheep anti-digoxigenin antibodies; and avidinTexas red and fluoresceinated rabbit anti-sheep IgG antibodies. Slides were viewed on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (100x magnification) through a dual band-pass filter (Omega, Erattleboro, VT), which allows fluorescein and Texas red to be viewed simultaneously. Slides were coded before analysis. Nuclei were scored randomly for the number of red and green hybridization sites on each chromosome. Photographs of representative nuclei were taken on 3M Scotch 640T color slide film (15-20 s exposures).

DNA markers within this interval revealed a duplication that is completely linked and associated with CMT1A. The duplication was demonstrated in affected individuals by the presence of three alleles at a highly polymorphic locus, by dosage differences at RFLP alleles, and by two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA from patients of different ethnic origins showed a novel SacII fragment of 500 kb associated with CMT1A. A severely affected CMT1A offspring from a mating between two affected individuals was demonstrated to have this duplication present on each chromosome 17. We have demonstrated that failure to recognize the molecular duplication can lead to misinterpretation of marker genotypes for affected individuals, identification of false recombinants, and incorrect localization of the disease locus."
"1","Fragments of the arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene from a patient with juvenile-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) were amplified by PCR and ligated into MP13 cloning vectors. Clones hybridizing with cDNA for human ARSA were selected, examined for appropriate size inserts, and used to prepare single-stranded phage DNA. Examination of the entire coding and most of the intronic sequence revealed two putative disease-related mutations. One, a point mutation in exon 3, resulted in the substitution of isoleucine by serine. Introduction of this alteration into the normal ARSA cDNA sequence resulted in a substantial decrease in ARSA activity on transient expression in cultured baby hamster kidney cells. About 5% of the control expression was observed, suggesting a small residual activity in the mutated ARSA. The second mutation, a G-to-A transition, occurred in the other allele and resulted in an altered splice-recognition sequence between exon 7 and the following intron. The mutation also resulted in the loss of a restriction site. Apparently normal levels of mRNA were generated from this allele, but no ARSA activity or immuno-cross-reactive material could be detected. A collection of DNA samples from known or suspected MLD patients, members of their families, and normal controls was screened for these mutations. Four additional individuals carrying each of the mutations were found among the nearly 100 MLD patients in the sample. Gene segregation in the original patient's family was consistent with available clinical and biochemical data. No individuals homozygous for either of these two mutations were identified. However, combinations with other MLD mutations suggest that the point mutation in exon 3 does result in some residual enzyme activity and is associated with late-onset forms of the disease. The splice-site mutation following exon 7 produces late-infantile MLD when combined with other enzyme-null mutations, implying that it is completely silent enzymatically.Am. J. Hum.

Introduction  Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a human genetic disease most commonly associated with a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA) (Kolodny 1989).

There is also an apparently benign lowARSA phenotype, which is difficult to differentiate from MLD on the basis of enzyme measurements (Dubois et al. 1975; Lott et al. 1976). This is commonly referred to as ARSA pseudodeficiency (PD) (Kihara et al. 1980). Differences in functional enzyme activity between PD and the MLD subtypes can be shown in intact cells by loading with a putative physiological substrate, cerebroside sulfate (Fluharty et al. 1978). All of the aforementioned ARSA defects appear to be due to allelic alterations in the ARSA gene, and their molecular bases are only now beginning to be understood.  Arylsulfatase A Mutations Stein et al. (1989) were the first to isolate a cDNA for human ARSA. Alterations associated with PD and two MLD-related mutations have recently been reported (Gieselmann et al. 1989; Polten et al. 1991). The latter two mutations together account for 50%60% of the MLD genes which have been evaluated. The mutations show a simple genotype-phenotype relationship such that homozygosity for one is always associated with late-infantile disease, whereas homozygosity for the other is most often found in individuals with adult-onset disease. Mixed heterozygotes for the two mutations manifest the juvenile form of MLD. We report here on the characterization of two additional ARSA mutations in a patient with juvenile MLD. The new mutations appear to be much rarer than those previously reported, and neither has yet been found in homozygous combination. However, their heterozygous combinations with other MLDcausing mutations suggest that they fit into the same general genotype-phenotype pattern as do the mutations reported elsewhere. Patient and Methods The Patient  The patient was one of two children in a family with no history of neurological disorders. He fits into the late-juvenile-onset category delineated by Kolodny (1989). He developed normally through age 9 years. His early academic performance was superior, and he played both flute and piano. After an operation at 9.5 years of age, social and scholastic difficulties were noted. He was often moody, eventually showing problems in short-term memory. In his 11th year he began psychiatric treatment, and by age 13 years was institutionalized. The progressive nature of the condition and the development of ataxic symptoms led to a clinical reevaluation. MLD was diagnosed on the basis of deficient ARSA, urinary sulfatide excretion, and a white-matter defect. Both the father and older sister had low enzyme levels and were shown to be carriers of the ARSA PD allele. DNA Preparation and PCR Amplification of ARSA Gene Fragments  Genomic DNA was prepared from cultured fibroblasts derived from a Swiss patient with juvenile MLD and from members of his family. Coding regions of the ARSA gene were amplified by the PCR in two segments, C and D, and were examined as described in  1341  a communication recently published elsewhere (Polten et al. 1991). The PCR fragments were purified and ligated into M13 mpl8 and mpl9 cloning vectors. Viral plaques containing ARSA gene fragments were identified by hybridization to a radiolabeled human ARSA cDNA. Ten to 12 plaques of each type and orientation were selected and grown as minipreps. Double-stranded phage DNA was isolated and evaluated for inserts of appropriate size, by restrictionenzyme excision and agarose-gel electrophoresis. In some cases it was necessary to redone virus isolates to obtain clones of acceptable homogeneity. Several independent clones of each fragment and each orientation were used to prepare single-stranded DNA for sequencing. Sequencing Sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy chaintermination method (Sanger et al. 1977). Multiple (usually six or more) clones were used for initial sequence screening. Sequencing primers included the universal M13 primers, various intron primers, and an occasional exon primer. Much of the human ARSA coding region was evaluated in both directions, and all exons were examined in at least one direction. The overall sequencing strategy is summarized in figure 1. Whenever a possible sequence alteration was detected, additional clones covering the same region were investigated.

Once a putative mutant sequence had been identified, two clones of each genotype (with and without the mutation) were selected for each strand orientation. These were then used to survey any remaining sequence in that particular gene subfragment (C or D). A small number of sequence alterations were detected only in single clones and were considered to be errors introduced during PCR amplification. Sequence data were compared with the human ARSA genomic sequence recently reported by Kreysing et al. (1990). Oligonucleotides  Oligonucleotides employed as PCR primers, sequencing primers, and sequence-specific probes and for site-directed mutagenesis were synthesized and purified in the laboratory by Dr. Bernnard Schmidt. An Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer was employed. A listing of the various oligonucleotides used in the present study is presented in table 1.  PCR  PCR was carried out using Taq polymerase (AmpliTaq) from Cetus, by the procedure outlined elsewhere (Gieselmann et al. 1989; Polten et al. 1991). A PCcontrolled robot and three regulated waterbaths were used for thermocycling. The A fragment, encompassing exons 1-3 and including introns, was obtained by using primers ARSA 1c or ARSA 1 ERic and ARSA 14nc. Fragment C, spanning exons 6-8, came from primers ARSA 19 ERic and ARSA 20 HI3nc. Fragment D, spanning exons 1-6, was obtained from primers ARSA 1 ERic and ARSA 17 BH1nc. For fragments A and C (approximately 1 kb each) a PCR program of 1 min denaturation at 970C, 1 min annealing at 500C, and 4 min extension at 700C was used. For fragment D (approximately 2 kb) the extension time was increased to 5 min. The buffer, which differs somewhat from that suggested by Cetus, has been described elsewhere (Gieselmann et al. 1989).

The sample population included nearly 150 individuals and was drawn from western Europe and North America. It was composed of MLD patients, their family members, and various controls. The MLD sample of approximately 100 individuals included all of the common subtypes at roughly the frequency at which they occur in the population. There were also some individuals of uncertain diagnosis. For SOP analysis, A (or occasionally D) and C fragments were PCR amplified as described above. Filters were prepared by first subjecting aliquots of the PCR reaction mixtures to alkaline denaturation. Neutralized samples were then heated to 950C for 5 min and immediately were applied to the HyBondtm nylon membranes by using a Schleicher and Schuell slot-blot apparatus. The usual blot represented 2.5 il of the PCR reaction mixture but was adjusted upward when the PCR yield was low. Filters were air-dried and were fixed to the membrane by UV illumination (30 s, facedown on the transilluminator) followed by heating at 800C for 1-2 h. Filters were prehybridized for 1-2 h. at 420C in a mixture containing 6 x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, and 100 jg denatured salmon sperm DNA/ml. A [32P]-labeled oligonucleotide probe was then added to the mixture, and hybridization continued for 6-18 h at the same temperature. The hybridization mixture was recovered and frozen and could be reused over a period of 2-3 half-lives (4-6 wk). Filters were rinsed three times in 6 x SSC and 0. 1% SDS at room temperature to remove adhering radioactive material and then were washed two times in the same solution for 10 min at the test temperature. Temperature in these washes was carefully monitored using a thermometer directly in the wash solution. To minimize test-to-test variation the same thermometer was always employed. After the final wash filters were drained, mounted wet between sheets of thin plastic film, and sealed to prevent drying. The filters were exposed to X-ray film with intensifying screens at - 700C for 3 h to several days, depending on the radioactivity of the bound probe. Where possible, differential test temperatures were established using test filters having known heterozygotes and homozygotes for each genotype. When no homozygote for a particular mutant gene was available, as was the case for the mutations reported here,  1343  the best temperature was inferred from the behavior of heterozygote samples. When practical, one set of filters was always washed at 420C, to monitor possible differences in the amount of DNA on spots of the same filter. These low-temperature filters could then be rewashed at a different test temperature if the initial results were unclear. Restriction-Site Analysis  A reaction mixture containing 3 Ril React 2 buffer (10 x ) (BRL), 2 gl of a fragment C PCR reaction mixture, and 1 il of the BstE2 stock was taken to a total of 30 Al with water. The digestion mixture was incubated at 600C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped with 5 p1 of gel-loading buffer IV (Sambrook et al. 1989, p. B24) and electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel with TAE buffer at 100 V until the dye front had moved 7-8 cm. Fluorescent bands were photographically recorded under UV illumination, and DNA fragments were transferred to Hybond nylon membranes by Southern blotting. After fixation of the nucleotide fragments to the membrane by UV illumination and heating, the membrane was hybridized with a labeled exon 7 oligonuckotide (ARSA 35nc) and was washed at 420C and radioautographed. mRNA Analysis  Total RNA was prepared from confluent fibroblasts. After the medium was removed, cells were rinsed with PBS and were harvested directly into 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate by scraping. Cellular debris were removed by centrifugation, and the DNA was fragmented by shearing. Extracts were then purified by centrifugation through a cesium chloride cushion (Stein et al. 1989). Nucleic acid content was initially estimated by measurement of the 260-nm absorbance, and apparently equal amounts were spotted on a 1% agarose/0. 7% formaldehyde gel and were examined by electrophoresis. Ethidium bromide fluorescence intensity on preliminary gels was sometimes used to adjust sample volumes to equivalent RNA levels on analytical gels. The gels were blotted onto Hybond nylon membranes by standard northern blot methodology. After fixation the filter was hybridized overnight with a freshly labeled human ARSA cDNA probe. Hybridization was at 420C in 48% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 4.8 x SSC, 1 x Denhardt's solution, and 100 gg salmon sperm DNA/ml. After hybridization, filters were washed twice with 2 x SSC containing 0. 1% SDS for  1344  15 min at room temperature and twice with 0.2 x SSC at 60'C for 30 min. Filters were drained, sealed in thin plastic, and put up with X-ray film with intensifying screens for 1 to several days. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Transient ARSA Expression Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the Eckstein method (Nakamaye and Eckstein 1986), in which a S dCTP is used to decrease nuclease susceptibility of the newly synthesized mutant strand and thereby improve the yield of mutant clones. BHK cells at a density of about 5 x 105/6-cm Petri dish were transfected with the expression vector pBEH (Artelt et al. 1988) containing either the normal or the mutant ARSA cDNA sequence. A calcium phosphate/glycerol shock procedure was employed (Kingston 1987). After growth for 48 h to allow expression of the human ARSA, cells were harvested in the presence of detergent. The ARSA was measured by a modified Baum assay (Baum et al. 1959) and 13 hexosaminidase with p-nitrophenyl N-acetylglucosamine (Fluharty et al. 1970). Total protein was estimated by the Lowry procedure (Lowry et al. 1951). Results Mutations  Two putative mutations were identified in the cloned PCR fragments of this juvenile MLD patient. Both were found in multiple clones of the same fragment and were confirmed in both coding and noncoding segments. One mutation was a T-to-G transversion at nucleotide 799, resulting in a change from isoleucine to serine in exon 3 (designated E3P799). The other mutation was a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 2195 (E7S2195). This occurs at the splice junction following exon 7 and is the first nucleotide of the subsequent intron. The mutation results in an alteration in the splice-initiation signal. (Gene alterations are designated with regard to the following: [a] location in gene structure, e.g., E3 = exon 3 or its immediately adjacent splice-recognition sequence; [b] type of alteration, e.g., P = point mutation leading to amino acid substitution; or S = mutation in splice-recognition sequence; and [c] number of initial nucleotide in altered sequence, e.g., 799 = 799th nucleotide beyond start of initiation codon.) Sequencing-gel segments showing these mutations are presented in figure 2a and b. The splice-site mutation (E7S2195) also results in  Fluharty et al. the loss of a restriction-endonuclease cleavage site. BstE2 and its isoschizomers recognize the sequence G-G-T-N-A-C-C. The sequence CAG GGTAACC CCT, which occurs in the normal sequence, is changed to CAG GTTAACC CCT in the mutant. Three BstE2 sites, two of which are in PCR fragment C, occur in the ARSA gene. Treatment of fragment C with BstE2 generates three subfragments which are well resolved on agarose-gel electrophoresis. A new, larger subfragment was present when the C fragment from this patient was evaluated. A similar higher-molecular-weight band was seen on BstE2 treatment of the C fragment from the patient's father but not on treatment of those from his mother and sister. Three additional MLD patients showing the larger restriction fragment were detected among 40 patients evaluated by this procedure. It was also possible to show the presence of the larger restriction fragment on Southern blots of these gels by using [32p]_ labeled oligonucleotide ARSA 35, which is specific for a normal exon 7 sequence near the site ofthe mutation. Only a single labeled fragment is generated from each genotype. This latter method of detection should be applicable to unamplified genomic DNA samples. The results of these tests are presented in figure 3.  Specific Oligonucleotide Probes Oligonucleotide probes specific for the two mutations were synthesized and used to survey appropriate PCR fragments. Five additional individuals positive for the point mutation in exon 3 (E3P799) were detected among the nearly 100 MLD patients. Two of these five individuals were members of the patient's family - i.e., his sister and mother. The father was not positive. Two were individuals with adult MLD, but neither was homozygous for this mutation. The fifth individual suffered from juvenile MLD. One of the adult patients also carried another recognized MLD mutation (E2S609, termed "I" by Polten et al. [1991]), which previously had been found only in late-infantile and juvenile MLD patients. The putative second mutations in the other adult MLD and juvenile MLD patients remain unknown. Other than those identified by the restrictionenzyme survey, no individuals positive for the E7S2195 mutation were detected. Again, only four MLD patients in our sample carried this mutation. All occurred in heterozygous combination with another characterized MLD mutation. Except for the juvenile-onset proband, all others are late-infantile MLD patients. Two of these also carried the E2S609 mu-  C  A 12  3  12  T  G 3  12  3  12  3 T  T  T C A C C C A C C C  T 0 0  T~~~ C~~~  ACGT  G~~~~~~~ C C  T C C A A  2Sequncingelgenn  at  79 ad 2195 I T,  C  79i  at  799iAlfu transversion at nucleotide ad2 s tegmnt shrtowng mutations atnulotie 9ad29.ToTtFiguameregi2 issequencedingg hel coe  shown for clone 1, and only G is shown for clones 2-6.

Portions of PCR-amplified C fragments were digested with BstE2, and the fragments were separated by agarose-gel electrophoresis as described in the text. The upper panel is a composite of bands visualized by direct UV fluorescence in the presence of ethidium bromide. Gels were then blotted to nylon membranes and hybridized to a [32p] oligonucleotide probe specific for nucleotides 2152-2170. The C fragment of the normal ARSA gene contains two BstE2 sites generating fragments of roughly 180, 340, and 470 bp. The mutant provides only two fragments, one of roughly 180 bp and one of roughly 810 bp. The oligonucleotide probe binds to the normal 340-bp and the mutant 810-bp fragments. The propositus (PR) and his father (FA), mother (MO), and sister (SI) are included in the composite, along with a variety of MLD patients of late-infantile (LI), juvenile (JY), adult (AD), or unknown (UK) age at onset. Molecular-weight standards are labeled (st).

Bohne, K. von Figura, and V. Gieselmann, unpublished data). In addition, three normal heterozygotes for this mutation were identified in the families of two of the patients. Examples of SOP analyses for these two mutations are shown in figure 4a and b. For a summary of the relationship of these mutations to MLD type, see table 2. mRNA Studies in Cells with the Splice-Site Mutation  Splice-site mutations often result in little or no mRNA. While no cell line homozygous for the E7S2195 mutation was available to test this issue directly, there were lines where this mutation was in heterozygous combination with the E2S609 mutation.  The latter had been shown not to produce any 2.1-kb mRNA for ARSA. Therefore, any 2.1-kb mRNA observed in the heterozygous E2S609/E7S2195 cell lines would have to have come from the gene with the E7S2195 mutation. Northern blots of RNA isolated from normal fibroblasts, from patients with the E2S609/E2S609, and from E2S609/E7S2195 genotypes were hybridized first with the ARSA cDNA and subsequently with a lysosomal acid phosphatase (LAP) cDNA. Autoradiographic films were quantified densitometrically to compare ARSA and LAP mRNA levels in the mutant cells (figure 5). This experiment confirms that alleles carrying the E2S609 splice-site mutation do not produce detectable levels of ARSA mRNA. It is surprising that the presence of the E7S2195  1347  Arylsulfatase A Mutations A  B  C  44 45  44 45  44 45  N P1MO Li P1 FA PD  2 3 4 5  Jv  U  6  Li  PD PD PD  7 8  AD  Jv  U  P7 JV  U  AD  PsAD N P.

Cultures transfected with the vector containing the E3P799 mutation produced only about 5% of the ARSA activity increase obtained with an unaltered ARSA cDNA insert. Cell protein and IB hexosaminidase activity were unaltered. These data are summarized in table 3.

One, des-  ignated E3P799, was a point mutation resulting in the replacement of an isoleucine by serine in exon 3. This alteration appears to substantially reduce, but not completely eliminate, enzyme activity. When the E3P799 mutation was introduced into the cDNA for normal human ARSA and was transiently expressed in BHK cells, about 5% of the control activity was induced. This low residual expression is consistent with this mutation occurring in individuals with lateonset (juvenile or adult) forms of MLD. E7S2195, the second mutation in this patient, altered an intron-exon splice-site recognition sequence. This change resulted in a complete absence of functional ARSA. There was also no evidence for any immuno-CRM. However, there did not appear to be a decrease in mRNA production. Since this mutation leads to a complete absence of enzyme in combination with other ARSA-null mutations, it would be expected to produce late-infantile MLD in homozygotes as well. Both of the newly described mutations were relatively rare in the MLD population evaluated, but neither was unique to the family in which it was discovered. The E3P799 mutation occurred in four of the nearly 100 MLD patients surveyed. Thus, this mutant allele accounts for roughly 2% of this MLD gene pool. The E7S2195 mutation was also detected in four MLD patients, accounting for another 2%. These mutations are, therefore, more than 10-fold less frequent than those described elsewhere (Polten et al. 1991). Homozygotes for the new mutations would be expected to be quite rare in a randomly breeding population and might only be encountered in cases of consanguinity. The phenotypic characteristics of these mutations must, at present, be inferred either from the properties of heterozygote combinations with other MLD mutations or from site-directed mutagenesis studies. The gene carrying the E3P799 mutation was otherwise identical to the reference human ARSA gene sequence (Kreysing et al. 1990). The E7S2195 mutation always occurred in combination with the E7P2162 polymorphism. The latter is a common polymorphic variant of the human ARSA gene, occurring in nearly one-half of the total gene pool evaluated. It is unlikely that any further gene alterations are associated with either of the two new MLD alleles. The entire coding sequence and most of the intervening intron sequences were examined, and no other reproducible sequence variations were encountered (other than previously noted corrections to the originally reported cDNA sequence [Kreysing et al. 1990]). Additional alterations  Arylsulfatase A Mutations in control regions either preceding the coding sequences or following the polyadenylation signal cannot be excluded. Both the independence of the E3P799 and E7S2195 mutations and their segregation with respect to the exon 7 polymorphism were confirmed by the investigation of other family members. The patient's father carried the E7S2195 mutation and the E7P2162 polymorphism, in addition to an ARSA PD allele. The E3P799 alteration was found in the mother, while the exon 7 polymorphism was absent. The patient's sister had the E3P799 mutation, lacked the exon 7 polymorphism, and carried the ARSA PD gene as well. This is summarized as a pedigree in figure 6. It appears likely that the partial enzyme deficiency associated with the E3P799 mutation results from a combination of a lowered activity in the mutant enzyme and a decreased stability of that enzyme. The site-directed mutagenesis results suggest that the mutant protein may have about 5% of the activity of the normal enzyme in the synthetic substrate assay. The residual activity toward physiological substrate in intact juvenile and adult MLD cell lines, however, is less than 1% of that in the typical control. Moreover, cells from an adult MLD patient heterozygous for this mutation and the null-activity E2S609 mutation have been shown in an extensive series of studies to be responsive both to leupeptin and to E64 stimulation of functional cerebroside sulfatase activity (A. L. Fluharty, K. K. Tsay, and R. Fisher, unpublished data).

The ARSA genotypes established for this family are shown. The father carries the PD alterations on one allele and the E7S2195 mutation on the other. This latter allele also has a neutral polymorphism, E7P2162, in exon 7. The mother carries the E3P799 mutation on one allele; the other allele has the normal reference sequence. The patient and his sister both received the E3P799 allele from the mother. The patient received the E7S2195 allele from the father, while his phenotypically normal sister inherited the PD gene.  1349 can be inferred that a portion of the overall enzyme deficit is due to protease susceptibility of the mutant enzyme. Thus, the allele containing the E3P799 mutation gives rise to a low but finite ARSA activity, and this activity is sufficient to delay the onset of demyelination and clinical symptoms. While we have no examples in which two copies of this gene are present in the same individual, we would expect this to result in adultonset disease. Two of the individuals heterozygous for this mutation are adult MLDs (onset later than 16 years of age). In the index case the combination of this mutation with one leading to a complete absence of functional enzyme resulted in juvenile MLD. However, the other example of a combination of the E3P799 mutation with a null-enzyme allele occurred in an adult MLD patient who has survived into his fifth decade. It is therefor possible that this mutation results in a somewhat less severe enzyme deficit than does the adult MLD-associated E8P2382 mutation reported elsewhere (as "A" in a paper by Polten et al.  ity, it  [1991]).  In two cells line where both the E2S609 and the E7S2195 mutations were present, no immuno-CRM or functional ARSA activity could be documented. Therefore, the E7S2195 splice-site mutation appears to result in a complete absence ofenzyme protein, even though it supports a normal level of ARSA mRNA synthesis. Reading through the intron between exons 7 and 8 would produce an altered reading frame in exon 8 and a premature chain termination. Such a transcript might still be processed to a poly A-tailed mRNA, even though it would code for a severely altered and presumably unstable protein. Alternatively, the mutation might lead to the elimination of the preceding exon (7) from the message. Further investigation of the ARSA mRNA produced by these cell lines will be needed to evaluate these postulates. This E7S2195 mutation would be expected to produce late-infantile MLD in a homozygote. Although no such individual was encountered in our extensive sample of MLD patients, this expectation was supported by the finding that, when this gene was in heterozygous combination with other null-ARSA mutations, late-infantile MLD resulted. The two mutations described here fit, for the most part, the simple genotype-phenotype pattern noted by Polten et al. (1991). One results in a complete absence of functional enzyme and thus gives rise to lateinfantile or juvenile MLD, depending on the nature of the other allele. The other mutation causes an alter-  1350 ation in the ARSA sequence, which leads to both a decreased enzyme activity and an enhanced susceptibility to proteolytic digestion. The mutant enzyme from the E3P799-containing allele may be somewhat more metabolically effective than that derived from the "adult" mutation described by Polten et al. (1991). However, this apparent difference could as well reflect variations in the subcellular environments of individual cell lines. Future studies on such partially active mutant enzymes, biosynthesized in permanently transfected expression systems, will allow detailed investigation of their properties and could aid in the design of rational therapies for MLD patients carrying these genes.

"1","Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disease due to deficiency of a hepatic enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). The absence of PAH activity results in typical PKU while persistence of a residual enzyme activity gives rise to variant forms of the disease. We report here a 3-base pair in-frame deletion of the PAH gene (delta 194) in a mild variant, with markedly reduced affinity of the enzyme for phenylalanine (Km = 160 nM), and we provide functional evidence for responsibility of the deletion in the mutant phenotype. Since the deletion was located in the third exon of the gene, which presents no homology with other hydroxylases, we suggest that exon 3 is involved in the specificity of the enzyme for phenylalanine. Finally, since none of the 98 PKU patients tested were found to carry this particular deletion, our study suggests that this molecular event probably occurred recently on the background of a haplotype 2 gene in Portugal.A 3-base pair in-frame deletion of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene results in a kinetic variant of phenylketonuria.THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY  Communication  Vol. 266, No. 15, Issue of May 25, pp. 9351-9354,1991 0 1991 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

In an attempt to characterize the mutant genotype in our patient, total RNA was extracted from the needle biopsy of the liver, after enzyme assays. Starting from approximately 20 mg of tissue, 80 pg of total RNA were obtained. Fig. 2A shows that the PAH mRNA of patient IV.2 was normal in size and amount. A cDNA library was constructed, and two full-length clones were obtained and sequenced. A 3-bp inframe deletion of an isoleucine codon wasdetected in exon 3 (AI94). However, since codons 94 and 95 are structurally identical, it is impossible to decide whether the deleted codon is codon Ile-94 or codon Ile-95 (Fig. 2 B ) . The rest of the sequence was identical to thatof normal cDNA (13).

Ornithine transcarbamylase ( O T C ) deficiency is the most c o m m o n inborn error of the urea cycle in humans and is responsible for lethal neonatal hypera m m o n e m i a in males. Partial O T C deficiency also occurs in females and can be responsible for life-threatening h y p e r a m m o n e m i c comas in heterozygotes. The cosegregation of the trait with a 5.8-kb abnormal MspI fragment in an affected family led us to hypothesize that this unexpected migration pattern was related to the mutation event in this particular family. Using polymerase chain reaction amplification of the specific m R N A derived from a post-mortem biopsy of the liver, we found that the MspI site located in the seventh exon of the gene was abolished and we finally identified a C-to-T transition at codon 225 of the c D N A , changing a proline to a leucine in the protein. Subsequent digestion of amplified exon 7 using the restriction enzyme MspI allowed direct screening for the mutant genotype during the next pregnancy. The present study supports the view that direct detection of the mutant genotype using either Southern blotting or digestion of amplified exons of the gene can contribute to genetic counselling in noninformative families. Finally, since MspI digestions are routinely p e r f o r m e d for restriction fragment length polymorphism-based family studies in O T C deficiency, we suggest that the possible presence of the 5.8-kb abnormal fragment should be investigated on Southern blots of affected individuals.  Introduction Ornithine transcarbamylase ( O T C ) deficiency is a severe X-linked defect of the urea cycle in humans and is responsible for lethal neonatal h y p e r a m m o n e m i a in affected hemizygous males. As a consequence of lyonization, partial O T C deficiency is also observed in heterozygotes (Jackson et al. 1986) and is responsible for various clinical symptoms (Batshaw et al. 1986). Shortly  Offprint requests to: D. Hentzen  after the relevant c D N A became available (Horwich et al. 1984), the O T C gene was found to span 73 kb and was m a p p e d to the short arm of c h r o m o s o m e X (Xp21.1; H a t a et al. 1988; Lingren et al. 1984). Subsequently, prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection became feasible using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)based family studies (Fox et al. 1986). Moreover, direct molecular detection of the mutation has been occasionally achieved by Southern analysis. Indeed, approximately 1 0 % - 1 5 % of patients have either deletions within the gene or point mutations that alter a TaqI restriction endonuclease site (Rozen et al. 1985; Maddalena et al. 1988; H a t a et al. 1989; Lee and Nussbaum 1989; G r o m p e et al. 1989, 1990). H e r e , we show that the mutation at a MspI ( C C G G ) site in the coding region of the gene can be detected by Southern blot analysis and used as the disease-marker for prenatal diagnosis in an affected family. This result supports the view that C p G doublets are hot-spots of mutations in the O T C gene and that direct detection of the mutant genotype can contribute to genetic counselling in non-informative families.  Case report The proband (III1, Fig. 1) was the first child of unrelated parents, and was born after a full-term pregnancy and normal delivery (birth weight: 3490g). He did well during the first 3 days of life, then he lost appetite and developed hypotonia and drowsiness. Vomiting, seizures and apneas occurred thereafter, then he rapidly fell into a deep coma and died at 9 days of age. Elevated blood ammonia (775 tamol/l, control below 30) was highly suggestive of a urea cycle disorder, and increased urinary orotic acid (33.6 lamol/mmol creatinine, normal below 6) with undetectable plasma citrulline led to the diagnosis of OTC deficiency. A post-mortem liver biopsy confirmed OTC deficiency with no detectable residual activity of the enzyme. The maternal uncle of the proband (II3. Fig. 1) and his maternal great uncle (not shown) also died in the neonatal period but no diagnosis was made. Finally, both the mother (112) and the maternal grandmother of the proband (I2) underwent a protein loading test (1 g/kg), A dramatic increment of urinary orotic acid in the 6-h period following the protein Ioad confirmed their status as carriers (15.0 and 15.1 lag/mgcreatinine for I2 and II2, respectively: normal below 6: Pelet et al. 1990:Bonaiti-Pelli6 et al. 1990).  154 Materials and methods  Total DNA isolated from circulating leukocytes, chorion villi, cultured fibroblasts and post-mortem biopsy specimens of the liver was digested with restriction enzyme MspI. electrophoresed on a 0.6% agarose gel. transferred onto nylon filters and hybridized with the full-length OTC cDNA probe (Horwich et al. 1984). Two RFLPs produced by the enzyme MspI have been described at the OTC locus. The variant bands in one polymorphic set are AI = 6.6 kb and A2 = 6.2 kb in length. The bands in the second set are B1 = 5.1 kb and B2 = 4.4kb (Fox et al. 1986). The OTC probe also detects five constant bands of 14. 5.4, 3.3, 2.3 and 1.9kb (Grompe et al. 1990). For mutant cDNA synthesis, the specific mRNA extracted from a frozen biopsy specimen of the liver was reverse-transcribed in cDNA using a specific oligonucleotide primer distal to the termination codon (primer B = nt 1066-1086: 5' TTCT-FGACAAGTAACACAACA 3', Fig. 2), and amplified using primer B and a second primer, proximal to the initiation codon (primer A = nt -21 to - I : 5' CCTTTACACAATTAAAAGAAG 3') (Fig. 2: Horwich et al. 1984: Hata et al. 1988). The amplification product was then purified and cloned in the double-stranded phage M13 for further sequencing by the dideoxy termination chain technique. For specific amplification of exon 7 of the OTC gene (Fig. 2), two primers flanking the invariant Mspl site at nt 675-678 were synthesized (primer C = CCTTCCTCCTI'TAGGGTTAT3',  Fig.1. a Pedigree and b Southern blot analysis of family affected at the OTC locus.

The 85-bp amplification product was digested with the enzyme MspI. electrophoresed on a 20% acrylamide gel and stained with ethidium bromide.  Results  S o u t h e r n blot analysis of g e n o m i c D N A digested with restriction e n z y m e MspI showed that p r o b a n d III1 was a hemizygote for R F L P haplotype A1 B1 at the O T C locus and that the 5.4-kb invariant f r a g m e n t normally located between the two p o l y m o r p h i c sets A and B was missing (Fig. 1). Instead, a 5.8-kb a b n o r m a l f r a g m e n t was detected both in the patient and in carrier individuals (I2 and II2, Fig. 1). W e therefore hypothesized that this abnormal b a n d was related to the m u t a t i o n event in this family. F o r this reason, the amplified c D N A of the proband was digested with the e n z y m e MspI. This e n z y m e normally recognizes two C C G G sites in the O T C c D N A (at nt 147-150 and nt 675-678, respectively) and cleaves the 1 107-bp amplified c D N A in three fragments of 167, 527 and 4 1 3 b p , respectively (Fig. 2). In the p r o b a n d , however, only two fragments of 167 and 9 4 0 b p were detected (Fig. 2), thus supporting the view that the abn o r m a l M s p I site was the distal site, located in the seventh exon of the gene (nt 675-678). F u r t h e r sequence analysis of the whole coding region revealed a C - t o - T substitution at nt 676, resulting in a proline to leucine transition at c o d o n 225 of the m R N A (Fig. 3). Convincing evidence that the C-to-T transition at c o d o n 225 was the primary disease-causing mutation was provided by complete sequence analysis in the p r o b a n d , showing that, apart from the C - t o - T transition, his c D N A was similar to the wild-type sequence. In o r d e r to d e m o n s t r a t e the co-segregation of the 5.8kb a b n o r m a l f r a g m e n t with the m u t a t i o n at c o d o n 225 in this family, amplified exon 7 of the O T C gene was digested in the p r o b a n d and in the h e t e r o z y g o t e carriers. Figures 2, 3 show that the 85-bp amplified f r a g m e n t was normally cleaved into two fragments of 61 and 2 4 b p , respectively, whereas no cleavage was o b s e r v e d in the p r o b a n d . T h e h e t e r o z y g o t e carriers displayed a combination of digested and non-digested fragments (Fig. 3).

The fetus III2, a female, was found to be normal both by Southern blotting (Fig. 1, lane 5) and enzymatic cleavage of amplified exon 7 (Fig. 3, lane 7).  Indeed, this abnormal restriction pattern is the hallmark of a deleterious mutation in the coding region (exon 7) of the O T C gene. Secondly, this study is consistent with the observation that C p G doublets are particularly susceptible to C-to-T transition mutations caused by deamination of a methylated C in either the sense or the antisence strand ( C o o p e r and Krawczak 1990). Indeed, about half the cytosines of the genome are 5-methylated, mainly when they belong to a 5' C p G 3' doublet. The accidental deamination of a 5-methyl cytosine leads to a transition to thymine, which may not be excised by the D N A repair system, thus resulting in an irreversible point mutation ( C o o p e r and Youssoufian 1988; Coulondre et al. 1978). There are several C p G doublets in the coding region of the O T C gene including four TaqI restriction sites ( T C G A ) and two MspI restriction sites ( C C G G ) . Base changes altering TaqI sites have previously been reported in exons 1, 3, 5 and 9 of the gene and m a k e up an important subgroup in O T C deficiency ( G r o m p e et al. 1990). Considering the high frequency of mutations of C p G doublets at TaqI sites, one can hypothesize that point mutations at MspI sites of the gene are also relatively frequent. Finally, it is worth keeping in mind that, in several families, heterozygous carriers cannot be studied by R F L P - b a s e d D N A diagnosis because there are no informative polymorphisms in that particular family. Direct detection of the mutant genotype can help solve these diagnostic problems in uninformative families or when the carrier status cannot be clarified by standard biochemical techniques (Pelet et a1.1990). Prenatal and carrier diagnosis can be greatly simplified by direct detection of mutant genotypes in families with such alterations, as shown in the present study using the restriction enzyme  MspI. Discussion The co-segregation of O T C deficiency with an abnormal MspI fragment of the O T C gene in a large pedigree led us to hypothesize that this unexpected migration pattern was related to the mutation event both in affected males and in heterozygote carriers in this family. Since two MspI sites are present in the coding region of the O T C gene, we first submitted the amplified c D N A derived from a p o s t - m o r t e m liver biopsy to digestion with the restriction enzyme MspI followed by gel electrophoresis. Using this procedure, we were able to demonstrate that the MspI site located in the seventh exon of the gene was abolished and to identify a C-to-T transition at codon 225 of the c D N A . This mutation resulted in a neutral to acid aminoacid substitution in the protein. The rest of the coding sequence was similar to that of normal individuals. The present observation deserves particular attention for several reasons. First, this is the first report of a mutation at an MspI site of the O T C gene, associated with this disease. Since MspI digestions are currently p e r f o r m e d for R F L P - b a s e d family studies in O T C deficiency, we suggest that it may be worth investigating the absence of the 5.4-kb constant fragment and the presence of a 5.8-kb abnormal fragment on Southern blots.

"1","A mutation involving an A-to-G nucleotide replacement at position 985 of the medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) cDNA was found in homozygous form in 18 unrelated MCAD-deficient families and in heterozygous form in 4 families. By PCR amplification and sequencing of cDNA from a compound heterozygote, we have detected a new mutation in an MCAD-deficient patient in whom one MCAD allele produces mRNA that is missing 4 bp in the MCAD cDNA, while the other allele carries the A-to-G-985 mutation. The presence of this 4-bp deletion was confirmed in the patient's genomic DNA by dot-blot hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes and by restriction analysis of PCR products. A rapid screening test for this 4-bp deletion was developed, based on mismatched primer PCR amplification. The deletion created a new restrictive-enzyme site which yielded two DNA fragments. The 4-bp deletion was not found in the three remaining MCAD chromosomes not harboring the A-to-G-985 mutation, nor it was present in 20 chromosomes from 10 unrelated normal Caucasians. The PCR-based method for screening these two mutations can detect over 93% of all MCAD mutations.Am. J. Hum.

The PCR-based method for screening these two mutations can detect over 93% of all MCAD mutations.  Introduction  Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder which may present in the first 2 years of life, as sudden unexplained death, Reyes syndrome, or encephalopathy with or without hypoglycemia. It is estimated to occur in 1/6,000-1/10,000 live Caucasian births. Each year approximately 500 new cases in the United States are expected, of which one-fourth will die with their first episode (Roe and Coates 1989). In fact, many families in which MCAD deficiency is recognized have already sustained the unexplained loss of a child. Once the diagnosis is made, further loss of a sibling because of MCAD deficiency can be prevented; avoidance of fasting, carnitine supplementation, and prompt intravenous glucose therapy during acute illness all constitute effective therapy.

The coding region is 1,263-bp and encodes a 421-amino-acid precursor protein. At the molecular level an A-to-G nucleotide replacement at position 985 (G-985) of the MCAD cDNA appears to be the single prevalent mutation causing MCAD deficiency (Matsubara et al. 1990; Yokota et al. 1990b; Ding et al. 1990; Kelly et al. 1990), although a 13-bp tandemrepeat insertion from position 999 (Yokota et al. 1990a) has been reported in a single patient. With a PCR-based method to screen the A-to-G-985 mutation, we have demonstrated its use in diagnosis and carrier detection of MCAD deficiency, by using (1) dried blood spots on filter papers, (2) paraffinembedded tissue, and (3) formalin-fixed tissue (Ding et al. 1991). The ability to diagnose MCAD deficiency in postmortem fixed tissues is particularly relevant, since this disorder often presents as sudden infant death. In the present paper we extend our molecular investigation of A-to-G-985 mutation to a total of 22 unrelated MCAD-deficient families. We found that 4 families are compound heterozygotes for the mutation. In 229  Ding et al.  230 one of these families, we identified a new mutation which involved a 4-bp deletion in the MCAD gene.  Patients and Methods Patients Twenty-two families of northern-European origin  who were affected by MCAD deficiency were studied. The diagnosis of all probands was based on detection of metabolites characteristic of MCAD deficiency (Millington et al. 1989). This was confirmed in 12 families by fibroblast-enzyme assay (Coates et al. 1985). Cloning and Sequencing of MCAD cDNA  Total RNA was prepared from peripheral lymphoby guanidinium-chloride extraction methods (Cox 1968). First-strand cDNA synthesized from total RNA by using AMV reverse transcriptase (Bethesda Research Lab, Gaithersburg, MD) was used for PCR to amplify the entire coding region of MCAD cDNA. The conditions for amplification were as follows: 100 pl reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% (w/v) gelatin, 1 gI of first-strand cDNA synthesis mixture (as template DNA), 50 pmol of each of the appropriate sense and antisense PCR primers (which were constructed so that BamHI sequences are present at the 5' and 3' ends of the PCR products; table 1, oligonucleotide 1 and cytes  2), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, and 2.5 units Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer-Cetus, Norwalk, CT); the overlay was 60 pl of mineral oil. The reaction was amplified for 30 cycles by denaturing at 940C for 1 min, annealing at 560C for 1 min, and extending at 720C for 1.5 min. The PCR product was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol, and the pellet was resuspended in 30 pl of TE buffer. The PCR product was then digested with BamHI (Bethesda Research Lab, Gaithersburg, MD) and subcloned into pGEM 3Zf( + ) Vectors (Promega Biotec, Madison, WI). Double-stranded dideoxy sequencing (Sanger et al. 1977) was performed using [35S] dATP and the Sequenase DNA-sequencing kit (United States Biochemical, Cleveland) with T7, SP6, or MCAD-specific primers (table 1, oligonucleotide 3 and 4). Identification of Mutation in the Genomic DNA To detect A-to-G-985 mutation, genomic DNA was amplified with mismatched primers (table 1, oligonucleotides 5 and 6) digested with NcoI and subjected to electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gel (Ding et al. 1990). To validate the 4-bp deletion, genomic  DNA corresponding to MCAD cDNA (position from 1052 to 1141) was PCR amplified with primers (table 1, oligonucleotides 7 and 8). The amplified products were dot blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane and hybridized with [32p] allele-specific oligonucleotides (table 1, oligonucleotide 9 and 10).

For rapid screening and further confirmation of the 4-bp deletion, the genomic DNA was amplified with mismatched primers (table 1, oligonucleotides 8 and 11). The amplified products were then subjected to BbvI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) enzyme digestion and electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Results  Twenty-two unrelated MCAD-deficient families were screened for the presence of A-to-G-985 mutation by restriction analysis of PCR products. This group included 10 families whom we have reported elsewhere (Ding et al. 1990). The A-to-G-985 mutation was present in homozygous form in 18 families and was present in heterozygous form in the remaining 4 families. One of the compound-heterozygote patients was further studied by PCR amplification and sequencing of cDNA. Three cDNA clones were sequenced. One differed from the wild-type MCADcDNA sequence by the substitution of A to G at position 985, a result consistent with the genomic data. The other two cDNA clones had normal A at position 985 as the wild type, but a 4-bp deletion from position 1102 to position 1105 of MCAD cDNA was found (fig. 1). There were no other nucleotide changes observed. The presence of the 4-bp deletion was confirmed in the patient's genomic DNA by dot-blot hybridization analysis with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes (data not shown) and by direct visualization of restricted DNA PCR products on gel electrophoresis. Since neither the normal nor the deletion allele surrounding the deletion contained a restriction site that could be used for segregating normal and mutant sequences, we used mismatched primers to amplify genomic DNA at the regions containing the predicted mutations, to create a new restriction site recognized by enzyme BbvI. After BbvI digestion, the 60-bp DNA fragment amplified from normal individuals remained intact (fig. 2A), while the compound-heterozygote patients having the 4-bp deletion three fragments were seen. The allele without the deletion remained intact as a 60-bp fragment, while the deletion allele yielded two fragments (33 bp and 23 bp) (fig. 2B). The patterns, however, do not allow distinction between patients and carriers, for the 4-bp deletion.  231  B  A 6  T A  C  S  T  A  C 3  3' C A  T  T  G T  C G A  T  A C A T  T G  C  A C T A A A  A  C  T A A A  C 6  T  T  51  51  Partial sequence of PCR-amplified cDNA clones Figure I from normal individual (A) and from patient with MCAD deficiency (B) showing deletion of 4 bp (TTAG). The arrowhead indicates the position of the deletion which corresponds to MCAD cDNA from 1102 to 1105.  By restriction analysis of the PCR product, both proband and affected sibling inherited the 4-bp deletion allele from their father (fig. 2B) and an A-to-G985 allele from their mother. The unaffected sibling inherited both the normal alleles from each of his parents (fig. 2B). The maternal side of this family has its origins in England, while the paternal side derives from the French-speaking part of Switzerland and from Wales. PCR study of the paternal grandparents revealed that the 4-bp deletion came from the paternal Welsh ancestry. The remaining three families with affected children who are compound heterozygous for the A-to-G-985 mutation were screened for the presence of this 4-bp deletion; none of these have revealed the same 4-bp deletion. Studies of 10 unrelated normal Caucasians did not reveal the mutation. Discussion A new mutation involving a 4-bp deletion in the MCAD cDNA at positions 1102 to 1105 in a patient with MCAD deficiency has been identified. The deletion could involve either cDNA positions 1100 to 1103 or cDNA positions 1101 to 1104, since both positions 1100 to 1101 and positions 1104 to 1105 have AG nucleotides.

Genomic DNA fragments were amplified with mismatched primers, digested with BbvI, and subjected to electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gel.

Thus, the deletion would predict an early truncation of the MCAD protein (385 amino acids vs. 421) and may, therefore, affect function of the gene product, beyond any significance which the new altered amino acids may have had. The mechanism by which the 4-bp deletion described here has occurred is unclear. The PCR experiment with genomic DNA demonstrates that this deletion takes place in an exon, since the size of the amplified genomic DNA was the same as would be predicted from the cDNA, and our genomic genesequences data indicate no intron between cDNA positions 944 and 1194 (authors' unpublished observation). This suggests that the 4-bp deletion is not the result of abnormal splicing at the intron/exon junction. Examination of cDNA sequences flanking the region of deletion did not reveal either tandem repeat of short motifs or significant homologous sequences flanking the deletion. These factors might have explained such a deletion (Roth et al. 1985; Chandley 1989; Jarman and Wells 1989).

Here we characterize an LDL receptor mutation that is associated with a distinct haplotype and causes FH in the Druze, a small Middle Eastern Islamic sect with a high degree of inbreeding. The mutation was found in FH families from two distinct Druze villages from the Golan Heights (northern Israel). It was not found neither in another Druze FH family residing in a different geographical area nor in eight Arab and four Jewish FH heterozygote index cases whose hypercholesterolemia cosegregates with an identical LDL receptor gene haplotype. The mutation, a single-base substitution, results in a termination codon in exon 4 of the LDL receptor gene that encodes for the fourth repeat of the binding domain of the mature receptor. It can be diagnosed by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization of PCR-amplified DNA from FH patients. Introduction  The LDL receptor is a cell-surface glycoprotein-mediating endocytosis of LDL and thus regulates plasma cholesterol (Brown and Goldstein 1986). Mutations in the LDL receptor gene cause the autosomal dominant disease familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) which is prevalent in about 0.2% of the general world population (Goldstein and Brown 1989). Individuals found to be heterozygous for a mutation in this gene have an elevated plasma LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) level and an increased risk for the development of ischemic heart disease (IHD). The Druze are a small Middle Eastern Islamic sect characterized by an eclectic system of doctrines and by a cohesion and loyalty among its members that have enabled them to maintain their identity and distinctive faith through almost 1,000 years (Goetz 1986).

In this community a high degree of inbreeding is evident, and the prevalence of consanguineous marriages is the highest of all groups in Israel and reaches 49% (Freundlich and Hino 1984). It is thus expected that mutant genes would proliferate in this community because of founder mechanisms and possible genetic drift. Here we describe an LDL receptor gene mutation that is responsible for FH in Druze families that reside in two different villages in the Golan Heights in Israel and who represent distinct Druze  lineages. Material and Methods Material  Restriction endonucleases, DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment), and other enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim) and Pharmacia (Piscataway, NJ). DNA sequence analysis was done using Sequenasetm (United States Biochemical, Cleveland). Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical (St. 427  Landsberger et al.  428  Louis). Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase I was obtained from Perkin Elmer-Cetus (Norwalk, CT). [a-32P] dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and [y_32p] ATP (7,000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from New England Nuclear (NEN) (Boston). Nylon membranes were purchased from Biotransm ICN Biochemical (Irvine, CA) and GeneScreen' (NEN). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Biotechnology (Rehovot, Israel). DNA was amplified using the Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research). LDL (density = 1.019-1.063 g/ml) and lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) (density > 1.25 g/ml) were prepared from human plasma, and the LDL was iodinated by the iodine monochloride method, all according to methods described elsewhere (Aulinskas et al. 1983). The monoclonal anti-LDL receptor antibody, IgG-C7, was prepared from hybridoma cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL/691) and was iodinated using iodogen (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL) according to the method of Beisiegel et al. (1981). Goat anti-mouse IgG (GAM-IgG) was purchased from Cappel Laboratories (Malvern, PA). Na'251 was from Amersham (Buckinghamshire), and 35S-methionine was from NEN (Du Pont, Wilmington, DE). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and methionine-free Eagle's minimum essential medium were provided by Highveld Biologicals (Kelvin, South Africa). Plasma lipids were determined on a Vitatron model FPS-A autoanalyser (Avro Scientific Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA). Additional materials are indicated where appropriate. Recruitment of Patients and Families Druze families with hypercholesterolemia were recruited through the Lipid Research Unit of The Rambam Medical Center in Haifa. Inclusion criteria for the index cases were as follows: hypercholesterolemia (plasma LDL-C level above the 95th percentile for age and gender), tendon xanthomas, and history of premature (age <60 years) IHD. For each patient and family member a fasting blood sample was collected in 0.15% (w/v) EDTA and was shipped on ice to the Lipid Research Laboratory at the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem for biochemical analysis and genomic DNA extraction. The following diagnostic criteria were used for the detection of homozygotes: plasma LDL-C >600 mg/dl and appearance of xanthomatosis during the first decade of life.  agnostic kits (Boehringer Mannheim). Plasma LDL-C levels were calculated according to the Friedewald- Levy formula (Friedewald et al. 1972). LDL Receptor Assays  Skin fibroblasts from an LDL receptor-normal person and from an FH homozygote patient (FH 350-3) of one of the Druze families were cultured, and LDL receptors were up-regulated for 48 h in medium containing LPDS, all according to methods described elsewhere (Grant et al. 1990). For surface binding at 40Cf of either 125I-LDL or '251-IgG-C7, cells were incubated for 2 h in DMEM supplemented with LPDS buffered with 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) and containing the indicated amounts of 125I-labeled ligands. The rate of degradation of the 125I-labeled ligands at 37°C was determined according to a method described elsewhere (Goldstein et al. 1983). For [35S] labeling and analysis of LDL receptors, cells were incubated with [35S] methionine (50 gCi/ml) in methionine-free medium and were chased in DMEM/LPDS containing 200 pM unlabeled methionine. LDL receptors were solubilized, immunoprecipitated using IgG-C7/GAM-IgG immune complexes, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography, all according to methods described elsewhere (Tolleshaug et al. 1982). Haplotype Analysis at the LDL Receptor Gene Locus  Genomic DNA was extracted from blood leukocytes (Hobbs et al. 1986) and diluted to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. LDL receptor gene haplotypes were constructed through the analysis of the joint segregation of 10 RFLPs, according to a method described elsewhere (Leitersdorf et al. 1989a).  Biochemical Determinations  DNA Amplification and Sequence Analysis Total RNA was isolated from human skin fibroblasts of a homozygote case by the guanidine thiocyanate method (Chirgwin et al. 1979). Complementary DNA was prepared using a random hexamer oligonucleotide primer and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (200 U/pl) (Gibco-BRL, New York). DNA amplification was done according to the method of Saiki et al. (1988), using the first-strand cDNA as a template. The whole coding region of the LDL receptor cDNA, including exons 1-18 was amplified using five sets of oligonucleotides. For the amplification of exons 1-4, upstream oligonucleotide primer designated AR12 (5'-A TAGGATCCAAATTGCGCTGGACCGTCGCCTTGC-3') that is homologous to exon 1 sequences  Plasma total triglycerides, cholesterol, and HDL-C levels were determined using commercially available di-  AR13 (5'-A TAGCATGCTCGTCAGGGCGACAG-  and downstream oligonucleotide primer designated  Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Druze  GTGGCCACAG-3') that is homologous to exon 5 sequences were used. These oligonucleotides were designed to include also six-nucleotide 5' extensions with the consensus sequence for BamHI and SphI restriction endonucleases, respectively (underlined in above sequences), and three additional nucleotides (italicized in above sequences). The PCR protocol included 1.5 min of denaturation at 940C and 5 min of annealing and extension at 680C, with the Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase enzyme for 35 cycles. After amplification, the PCR products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel, and the appropriate band was extracted, purified, and subjected to BamHI/SphI digestion followed by subcloning into bacteriophage Ml 3. Sequence analysis of both strands of two independent M13 clones was performed using the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method (Sanger et al. 1977). Detection of the Druze Mutation Oligonucleotides Dl (5'-CCCCAGCTGTGGGCCTGCGACAACG-3') and D2 (5'-CGCCCATACCGCAGTTTTCC-3') were used for amplification of the 3' end of exon 4 of the LDL receptor gene according to a method described elsewhere (Leitersdorf et al. 1989b). After amplification, the DNA was size fractionated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, and the band sizes were verified. Each one of the PCR products was denatured in 0.4 N NaOH/0.025 M EDTA and was dot blotted twice on a nylon membrane (GeneScreen."; NEN) and hybridized to [32P]-end-labeled allelespecific oligonucleotide probes (oligonucleotide 350NL 5'-GTCTTTACGTGTTCCAA-3' and oligonucleotide 350-MU 5'-GTCTTTAGGTGTTCCAA-3'), homologous to the normal and to the mutant genes, respectively. The filters were prehybridized at 430C in 5 x SSPE /5 x Denhardt's solution/0.5% SDS for 20 min and then hybridized with 1 x 106 cpm/ml end-labeled oligonucleotide for 1 h. The filters were then washed in 2 x SSPE/0.1% SDS three times (for 5 min each) at room temperature, once for 10 min at 46°C, and once for 3 min at 53°C. Autoradiography was performed at - 70°C for 5 h on Kodak XAR-5 film. After autoradiography the filters were stripped at 75°C, and those that were originally hybridized with the normal probe were rehybridized with the mutant probe, and vice versa. Results Druze FH families were recruited from the follow-  ing three villages: Majdal Shams (family FH 350) and Ein Kuniye (family FH 367) (from the Golan Heights  429 in northeastern Israel) and Isfiya (family FH 351) (from the Carmel Mountains in northwestern Israel). In one family with a homozygote case (FH 350-3), parental consanguinity could be demonstrated. Analysis of 10 RFLPs at the LDL receptor gene locus in families FH 350 and FH 367 revealed that haplotype 1 (BsmI +, SphI +, StuI +, AvaIl +, SpeI -, ApaLI5' + , PvuII - , NcoI + , PstI + , and ApaLI-3' + ) cosegregates with hypercholesterolemia in both families (data not shown). Haplotype analysis was not carried out on individuals from family FH 351. Fibroblast cultures were prepared from a clinically homozygote Druze FH patient (FH 350-3) who was found also to be homozygous for LDL receptor haplotype 1. The binding and degradation of 125I-LDL and 125I-IgG-C7 monoclonal antibody was studied in fibroblasts from FH 350-3 and from a normal control (table 1). The mutant cells exhibited a lack of functional LDL receptors, being unable to specifically bind or degrade either 125I-LDL or 125I-IgG-C7 monoclonal antibody. The synthesis and processing of LDL receptors in cells from the homozygote patient and from the normal control were also compared. Whereas both precursor and mature forms of the LDL receptor, biosynthetically labeled with 35S-methionine, were found in normal cells, no LDL receptor protein was detected in either mutant cell extracts or in culture medium from the mutant cells (data not shown). After these initial observations, PCR amplification of the whole coding region of the LDL receptor gene of FH 350-3 was performed. The size of amplified products were identical to that in a control sample and were as expected from the known cDNA sequence. The PCR fragments were then subcloned into a bacteriophage M13 vector. Sequence analysis of exons 1318 of the gene was performed and did not reveal any abnormality. Subsequently, a guanine-for-cytosine substitution that converts codon 167 from a tyrosine to a stop codon (fig. 1) was identified in exon 4. This was the only sequence abnormality that was found in exons 1-4 of the gene. Detection of the Druze mutation was based on DNA amplification of the 3' end of exon 4, followed by hybridization to end-labeled allele-specific oligonucleotide probes (fig. 2). By this method it was found that the mutation is present in FH individuals from families FH 350 and FH 367. It is not present either in family FH 351 or in eight additional index cases of other Arab communities, including seven Moslems and one Christian who was previously shown not to carry the Lebanese allele (Oppenheim et al., in press).

Analysis of 35 individuals from two Druze families (FH 350 and FH 367) revealed that 17 carry the mutant allele. The mean ( ± SD) plasma LDL-C levels for the controls was 100.0 ( ± 33.1) mg/dl, and that for the cases (those who carry the mutant allele) was 252.9 ( ± 63.0) mg/dl. The age-related plasma LDL-C levels for the cases and for the controls are presented in figure  3. A widespread distribution of plasma LDL-C is evident in both groups. One case has an LDL-C level which is close to the normal range, and four controls were found to have LDL-C levels above the 95th percentile for their age.

The mutation, a single-baise substitution, results in a premature termination c()don at amino acid residue number 167 in the fourth rccpeat of the binding domain of the receptor. It is the ifirst mutation characterized at the molecular level in tlhis community. Experiments in fibroblast cultures revealed the absence of immunoprecipitable protein. Thte mutation is thus classified as a class 1 (null) mutatiori (Brown and Goldstein 1986). A recent study revealed that, among 20 FH homozygotes bearing class 1 E)henotype, 15 different mutations could be demonst:rated, eight of which have thus far been characterizedt at the molecular level (Hobbs et al. 1988, 1990). NZone of these were found to be identical to the mutation characterized here. Some of the known LDL receptor mutant alleles have been found to be sporadic, wihereas certain mutations are common in several definied populations (Hobbs et al. 1987; Lehrman et al. 19837; Aalto-Setala et al. 1989; Leitersdorf et al. 1989b, 1 990; Meiner et al. 1991). Here we show that the Druz(e mutation could be unique to the Druze sect,  The Druze mutation adds to the relatively large number of naturally occurring point mutations that have been localized to exon 4 of the LDL receptor. This may reflect the functional importance of those 0repeats of the receptor binding domain (repeats 3-5) that are encoded by exon 4 (Hobbs et al. 1990). The Druze mutation occurs in a CpG dinucleotide, a sequence known to be a mutational hot spot because of the transition of methylated C residues (occurring only in CpG dinucleotides) to T residues that is a result of deamination (Cooper and Krawczak 1990). However, such a mechanism is clearly not applicable in the case of the Druze mutation, which corresponds to a C-to-G transition. The Druze sect was founded in the 11th century and remained isolated because of religious restrictions prohibiting outbreeding. For example, several genetic markers that were examined among the Druze show significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg distribution, because of increased homozygosity which might be explained by a high degree of consanguinity (Nevo 1988). Krabbe disease, a rare progressive autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder, is prevalent in a large Druze kindred in Israel, probably because of the same mechanism (Zlotogora 1985). The prevalence of FH in the Druze is unknown. Because of the high degree of consanguinity, as well as the existence of this population in a localized area for an extended period of time, a significant founder effect with high frequency of the mutant gene reported here is expected. Figure 3 reveals, in two Druze families (FH 350 and FH 367), a wide range of LDL-C levels among individuals carrying the Druze mutant allele as well as among siblings who do not harbor the Druze mutation but who, in some cases, are hypercholesterolemic. These findings indicate that, in addition to the mutation reported here, other major effects (mutant genes and/or environmental factors) may contribute to hypercholesterolemia in this community. The relative impact of these factors on the prevalence of IHD in the Druze population is unknown. This issue is currently under investigation.  Acknowledgments We thank Drs. M. S. Brown, J. L.

Here we characterize an LDL receptor mutation that is associated with a distinct haplotype and causes FH in the Druze, a small Middle Eastern Islamic sect with a high degree of inbreeding. The mutation was found in FH families from two distinct Druze villages from the Golan Heights (northern Israel). It was not found neither in another Druze FH family residing in a different geographical area nor in eight Arab and four Jewish FH heterozygote index cases whose hypercholesterolemia cosegregates with an identical LDL receptor gene haplotype. The mutation, a single-base substitution, results in a termination codon in exon 4 of the LDL receptor gene that encodes for the fourth repeat of the binding domain of the mature receptor. It can be diagnosed by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization of PCR-amplified DNA from FH patients."

One main variant appeared in the first decade with proximal muscle weakness progressing over the next 20 years to wheelchair confinement, and appeared compatible with classical limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The other main variant showed onset of distal muscle weakness in lower limbs in the third or fourth decade, progressing very slowly without greater disability throughout the lifetime. Tibia1 muscle weakness and wasting were clinical landmarks in this variant, but computed tomography of skeletal muscle revealed focal areas of fatty degeneration also in truncal, pelvifemoral, and distal leg muscles in a way not previously reported in distal myopathy.

STUDY DESIGN, PATIENTS AND METHODS  A multigeneration family, containing several hundred members from the rural district of Larsmo in Finland, was investigated genealogically through parish records, historical archives, and private sources. T h e diagnosis of LGMD was made on index subjects suffering from a severe muscle disease in 1982. Characteristic findings were excessive muscular weakness and atrophy affecting predominantly proximal muscles with no pseudohypertrophy o r myotonia. Serum creatine kinase activity was elevated, electromyographic examination showed myopathic changes, and muscle biopsy findings were compatible with muscular dystrophy . During subsequent years, new cases of milder myopathy were discovered, and their relationship to the index family was confirmed. Altogether, 18 patients belonging to the family have been examined. A detailed neurological re-examination was performed on 14 of them for this study. Five further subjects were considered to have had muscle disease by history.

Activity levels were correlated against the upper normal limit, since laboratory methods and limits have changed during the years of follow-up.  Examinations carried out on 14 patients, with needle-electromyography (EMG) on multiple muscles in both upper and lower limbs and, occasionally, on paravertebral muscles. Both motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities (NCV) were measured in upper and lower extremities. Electrocardiograms were obtained from 14 patients.  very limited until this century. Consanguineous marriages have been common as far back as family histories can be traced to the 17th century. The family tree was traced back for 11 generations. All affected members proved to be descendents of the same ancestor parents: I/1 born in 1659, and his first wife I/2 (Fig. 1). Patients were not aware of these relationships.  Electrophysiological Examinations.  “Semi-o en” muscle biopsies were taken with conchotome’ from lateral vastus muscle in 6 patients, from tibia1 anterior muscle in 3 patients, and from gastrocnemius muscle in 3 patients. One patient had a muscle biopsy taken from semimembranosus muscle, and another patient from both quadriceps and biceps muscles. The muscle was frozen rapidly in isopentene cooled with liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections of 1O-pm thickness were stained using hematoxylin and eosin (HE), rapid trichrome, NADH-TR, and myosin adenosine triphosphatase (ATP) methods, the latter after preincubation in buffers with pH values of 9.4, 4.6, and 4.3, re~pectively.~ Muscle Biopsy.  B  Imaging Methods. In 13 patients, computed tomography (CT) was performed with a C T 8800 scanner (General Electric). Ten-millimeter thick sections of leg, thigh, hip, and shoulder muscles were obtained. Ultrasonography (US) of the same muscle groups was also performed with a 7.5 MHz probe (Toshiba). In 5 patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed with a low field resistive system operating at 0.02 Tesla (Instrumentarium). Transaxial, 1O-mm thick sections of legs and thighs were obtained. Chest X-rays and echocardiographic examinations were made on specific indications.

Clear muscle symptoms were already apparent at the age 7, as he could not run with other children. He never learned to skate, but was able to ski until the age of 10. He completed his ordinary schooling at the age of 16. At 24, he could not walk anymore. He is now 47 and lives in an apartment for the disabled. On neurological examination, at age 40, he showed generalized atrophy and weakness in all muscles except erector spinae, head, and neck muscles. He could move his upper extremities against gravity and was able to carry out daily activities such as eating, washing, and shaving. His serum CK value was twice the upper normal limit. EMG revealed polyphasic units of low amplitudes in all limb muscles. Muscle biopsy showed atrophy, fat, and fibrosis with great variation in fiber size. No neurogenic changes could be found. At age 47 he could not elevate his arms, and barely had the strength to flex his fingers. He could hardly move his toes or ankles, but despite that he showed no vertebral scoliosis or joint contractures. He was able to maintain his trunk erect and showed no sign of dysarthria, facial muscle weakness, or dysphagia. Myotonia, muscular hypertrophy, or sensory changes were not detected, and all tendon reflexes were absent. Imaging methods confirmed severe loss of muscular structures in all examined muscles, most pronounced in proximal limb muscles. Subject X/45. Developmental milestones were normal and medical history was unremarkable. As a youngster he was active in sports. During his military service, at age 22, he noticed aching in leg muscles after very long marches. This symptom persisted and he subsequently gave up athletic activities. At age 39, he observed weakness in lifting toes and feet. The symptom was progressing slowly. On examination at age 44 he could not walk on his heels and had reduced strength in dorsiflexion of ankles and toes. Tibia1 anterior  MUSCLE & NERVE  November 1991  1051  FIGURE 1.

EMG was normal in humeral, pelvic, paravertebral, and calf muscles as in interosseal and extensor brevis muscles. Only the left tibial anterior muscle showed myopathic changes. Muscle biopsy from lateral vastus muscle was normal except for an increased number of internal nuclei (Fig. 2B). Ultrasonography and C T scans, in particular, revealed fatty involvement of both tibial anterior muscles and similar focal changes in the left soleus muscle. Summary of Case Histories and Clinical Findings. (Table 1.). Seven patients (IW16, 1x144, IW54,  1x155, W17, X18, W23) showed profound proximal muscle weakness and atrophy. T h e symptoms varied widely with regard to the age of onset, the progression rate, and severity. Three patients (IW 44, IW54, IW55) showed good distal strength and  were able to walk at an advanced age. Their deep tendon reflexes were usually preserved. Four patients also displayed severe distal weakness and total loss of deep-tendon reflexes, and they were severely disabled in early adulthood. Patient IX/ 12 died in 1983 before we had an opportunity to see him. According to records of clinical examination, at the age of 55, the onset and progress of muscular weakness and disability were similar to the history related in the case report of patient X/23. T h e other 10 patients had distal leg muscle weakness and their proximal muscular strength was within the normal range. Walking became clumsy around the age of 40. In some cases, the onset was delayed into their 60s. Three of the male patients experienced aching in their leg muscles after strenuous physical activity even decades before the distal leg muscle weakness appeared. Vague proximal weakness in lower limbs was found in 3 subjects, but otherwise, muscle weakness and atrophy was confined to tibial anterior  Table 1. Physical muscle findings.

Three patients showed some pseudohypertrophy in the upper extremities. No sign of scoliosis, sensory impairment, muscular fasciculation or myotonia was detected in any patient. Patients with the profound muscular atrophy had some tight tendons in arms and legs, but no real contractures. None of the patients had symptoms of cardiomyopathy. However, one patient (W17) had chronic atrial fibrillation. He died of an acute heart attack at the age of 55. An autopsy was not carried out. Another patient (W16) had occasional cardiac arrhythmias. Summary of Laboratory and Neurophysiological Results. (Table 2.). Creatine kinase activity was found  to be moderately increased, 1.5 to 2 times the upper normal limit, in 6 patients with proximal muscle weakness. In 8 patients with distal leg muscle weakness, CK increases varied from 1.5 to 4 times the upper normal limit. One patient in the former, and 2 patients in the latter group had  normal CK levels (Table 2). Patient W15 was analyzed 7 times in 11 years, and the CK activity varied from normal to 3.5 times the upper normal limit. Electromyographic and NCV studies revealed no sign of neurogenic disorder (Table 2). In patients with profound proximal muscle weakness, all the examined muscles showed myopatic changes except for interosseal muscles in IW54, and extensor brevis muscles in IW55. In the distal leg muscle weakness group, 1 patient (IX/17) who had been treated with cytostatic drugs for a gynecological malignancy, showed moderately decreased sensory NCV and findings suggestive of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Otherwise, EMG findings were consistent with myopathic changes in tibial extensor muscles in all 10 patients. Two patients had minor myopathic changes in more than one other muscle group. In all the 6 patients tested, extensor brevis muscles were normal. Two patients also showed signs of lumbar radiculopathy (W40, W20).  Table 2.

Echocardiographic examinations were made in these 2 patients, as well as in the patient with cardiac arrhythmia (W16), but no cardiomyopathy was detected.  Patients with proximal muscle weakness usually displayed pronounced histopathological changes including atrophy, variation of fiber size, splitting of fibers, increased internal nuclei counts, necrosis and fibrosis (Fig. 2A).

In patients with distal leg muscle weakness, the biopsy was usually taken from femoral muscle. Histopathological findings were mild. An increased number of fibers with internal nuclei was the most frequent sign found in 6 of 8 biopsied patients in this group (Fig. 2B). Three patients displayed a marked variation in fiber size and fiber splitting. Such myopathic findings as necrosis, hyalination, vacuolar degeneration, and increased endomysial fibrosis were seen only occasionally.

Definitive focal changes of the same category were, furthermore, discovered in various muscles often asymmetrically (Fig. 3C to 3E). Five patients showed additional changes in calf muscles, and 4 patients had affected parts of femoral muscles. Two patients had asymmetrical changes in gluteal muscles, and 1 patient with known lumbar spondylolisthesis, displayed marked changes in paravertebral lumbar muscles. All patients had some additional muscle finding besides the involvement of tibial anterior muscles. A more detailed report on methods and results will be published separately. (Fig. 1). The large family contains 23 known affected members in 13 different sibships. Severe proximal muscular dystrophy appeared alone in 3 sibships, and the distal leg muscle weakness alone in 9 sibships. Both clinical phenotypes were represented in 1 sibship. In 4 instances of distal leg muscle weakness there were affected persons in 2 consecutive generations. The severe proximal muscular dystrophy was always seen in 1 generation only. Consanguinity was marked, although only 1 of the 75 pairs of patients in the pedigree were first cousins. Kinship of parents was proved in 20 pairs. Among parents of affected members, consanguinity was discovered in 1 1 of the 13 pairs. The examination of asymptomatic family members is in progress, and a report on clinical genetics and further genealogical data will be published separately. Pedigree Analysis.  DISCUSSION  Differential diagnosis of hereditary neuromuscular diseases is based on clinical, genetic, and histopathological findings. Histopathology does not provide distinction among subgroups within muscular dystrophy. As the pedigree data is very complex in this large family, the clinical definition becomes even more important. The affected family members can be divided into 2 separate groups according to their clinical features. Eight patients had proximal muscle weakness starting in the first to third decade. The clinical course was progressive causing loss of walking ability usually in the third or fourth decade but, in some cases, as late as the seventh decade. These patients fit classical descriptions2' as well as later and recent definitions of LGMD.3,20In 3 patients,  MD With Separate Phenotypes in a Family  the onset was so early that they could, perhaps, be better placed under the heading of autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy of ~hildhood.~" In the second group, the patients had a completely different clinical picture with distal leg muscle weakness appearing in the fourth to the seventh decade. The progression was slow and the patients preserved their walking ability, even into the ninth decade. Three of these patients had not been aware of their disease, or at least had not sought medical advice, which illustrates the mild nature of the condition. Under clinical examination, anterior tibial muscles were usually the only affected muscle group. Imaging methods revealed, however, unexpected patchy involvement in various asymptomatic muscles beyond the anterior tibial muscles. The patients in the second group fall into the category of distal myopathies, but it is difficult to give them a specific diagnosis. T o our knowledge, studies of this particular type of myopathy have not been published. Their muscle weakness was confined to lower leg muscles, contrary to what is found in Welander's disease2g and in other distal myopathies in which hand muscles are also clearly i n ~ o l v e d . ~Entities *'~ like scapuloperoneal muscular dystrophy27 or autosomal dominant humeroperoneal myopathy' are, therefore, also excluded. Weakness of anterior tibial muscles and decreased dorsiflexion of ankles is a common finding in both proximal and distal muscular dystrophies, 1,3,26,29 but in these entities, the clinical muscle involvement extends far beyond the anterior tibial muscles. Intrinsic foot muscles were not affected, as is found in sporadic anterior compartment myopathy. 14,16 There were no findings that suggested any neurogenic Creatine kinase activities were abnormally high, but not to the extent seen in some distal myo athies inherited in autoIn other cases, the disoma1 recessive fashion. stal myopathy is already apparent in childhood,22 which was not found in our patients. Histopathological examination could not disclose other characteristic features like rimmed vacuoles, reported in some forms of distal m y ~ p a t h y , ~ , ' ~ ,or " ~in' ~ LGMD with autosomal dominant i n h e r i t a n ~ e . ~ In the present family, severe proximal muscular dystrophy occurred in 4 sibships, and both sexes were represented among the patients. The parents were highly consanguineous, and none had any symptoms of proximal muscle weakness. These findings are compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance. Also, distal leg muscle weakness appeared in both sexes-but in successive  '  '',''  MUSCLE & NERVE  November 1991  1057  generations. This would suggest autosomal dominant inheritance for this particular form, and such an explanation supports the existence of 2 separate muscle diseases in the same pedigree. The simultaneous occurrence of 2 such rare muscle disorders in the same family is, of course, unlikely, and raises the possibility of other explanations. The autosomal dominant form of LGMD has a variable clinical picture, ranging from classical proximal muscle weakness to predominantly distal muscle involvement with slow progre~sion.~ This could, perhaps, explain the different manifestations, although our own experiences of this entity favor a mild muscle involvement associated with joint c o n t r a ~ t u r e snot ~ ~ seen among these patients. In Welander’s series of hereditary distal myopathy, there were some “grossly atypical  cases” with severe proximal muscle weakness thought to re resent homozygously inherited dominant gene.’ Most of the patients in her original d e ~ c r i p t i o nwere ~ ~ from an area in Sweden that faces the Larsmo archipelago on the other side of the Bothnic Gulf. However, the pattern of inheritance in several sibships does not support dominant inheritance. Finally there could be several allelic genes for autosomal recessive LGMD. That would create possibilities for genetic compounds that might show variable clinical manifestations, as demonstrated with various forms of hexosaminidase deficiency diseases.I2 The probability of such compounds would be greatly increased in highly consanguineous populations like the family investigated in the present study.

One main variant appeared in the first decade with proximal muscle weakness progressing over the next 20 years to wheelchair confinement, and appeared compatible with classical limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The other main variant showed onset of distal muscle weakness in lower limbs in the third or fourth decade, progressing very slowly without greater disability throughout the lifetime. Tibial muscle weakness and wasting were clinical landmarks in this variant, but computed tomography of skeletal muscle revealed focal areas of fatty degeneration also in truncal, pelvifemoral, and distal leg muscles in a way not previously reported in distal myopathy. The overall difference in clinical findings between these main variants would suggest 2 separate genetic entities, genealogical data makes a common genetic background possible.Muscular dystrophy with separate clinical phenotypes in a large family."

Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disease involving defects in calcium release (Britt, 1989). Exposure of MH-susceptible (MHS) individuals to inhalational anesthetics and skeletal muscle relaxants leads to sustained muscle contraction, a condition dependent on elevated sarcoplasmic free Ca2’. Attendant hypermetabolism, elevated temperature and blood salt, and pH imbalance can result in neurological, liver, and kidney damage and are potentially fatal unless the conditions are reversed. The primary MH defect is believed to lie in hypersensitive gating of the MHS Ca2+ release channels of human and porcine skeletal muscle sarcoplas’ Present address: Department of Biochemistry, Osaka sity Medical School, 2-2 Yamadaoka Suita 565, Japan. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The RYRl gene encoding the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (Zorzato et al., 1990) has been localized to human chromosome 19q13.1 (MacKenzie et aZ., 1990) and linked to mutations causing MH susceptibility in humans (MacLennan et al., 1990). Linkage studies (Harbitz et al., 1990) have also implicated the RYRI gene in the MHS phenotype in swine. We have, therefore, undertaken a systematic search for genetic alteration in the RYRl gene in both pig and human MHS individuals. In a study of MH swine, we found that replacement of Cl843 in the cDNA from an MH normal (MHN) pig with T1843 in the cDNA from an MHS pig was the only nucleotide substitution, of 18 observed, that resulted in an amino acid substitution (Fujii et al., 1991). This base substitution, leading to the replacement of arginine 615 with cysteine, was correlated with and likely to be causative of MH in over 450 animals from six breeds of pigs (maximum lod score of 101.75 at flrmu = 0.0 in 338 informative meioses; Fujii et aZ., 1991; Otsu et al., 1991). By analogy, the corresponding human mutation would be likely to predispose to at least one form of human MH. We now report that the corresponding base substitution and amino acid replacement occurs in a human MH family where its inheritance can be correlated with inheritance of MH susceptibility. We tested for the presence of the potential alteration (C1840-*T) in human genomic DNA by a combination of oligonucleotide probing, restriction endo-  Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a devastating, potentially lethal response to anesthetics that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals. The skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYRZ) gene has been linked to porcine and human ME. Furthermore, a Cys for Arg substitution tightly linked to, and potentially causative of, porcine MH has been identified in the ryanodine receptor. Analysis of 36 human families predisposed to malignant hyperthermia has revealed the presence, and cosegregation with phenotype, of the corresponding substitution in a single family. This substitution, by analogy to the findings in pig, may be causal for predisposition to MH in this family. o IBW Academic  revised  Univer-  751 All  Copyright 0 1991 rights of reproduction  OSSS-7543/91$3.00 by Academic Press, Inc. in any form reserved.  752  SHORT  A 1808 603  Primer  COMMUNICATION  Primer  1  TGCTCCCTGTGTGTGTGTAATGGTGTGGCTGT C S L C" C N G  Primer3  2  CCRACCAAGATCTTATTACTGAGAACTTGCTGCCTGGCCGTGAGCTTCTGCTGCAGACAAACCTCATCAACTATGTCACCAG Q T N L I NYVT N Q D L I T EN L L P G R E L L L  5’  I  ARG  I CYS  1925 642  A  D  ~ H15-T  S  3  T/C  ;z1 3’  --  r[I:  5  FIG. 1, (A) Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of part of the exon in which the C1840+T alteration was located. The first line illustrates the location of the nucleotide alteration (boxed), the second and third lines illustrate the normal nucleotide and amino acid sequences numbered according to Zorzato et al. (15), and the fourth line illustrates the alteration in amino acid sequence resulting from the change in codon sequence (boxed). The locations of the forward and reverse primers (primers 1 and 2) used in PCR amplification of the 74-bp sequence surrounding C1840+T are indicated by overlining of the corresponding nucleotide sequences. The location in the nucleotide sequence of the reverse primer (primer 3) used for both amplification and direct sequencing of the 134-bp product is double-overlined. Alteration of the normal sequence GTAC 1840 to the mutant sequence GTAT1840 leads to the deletion of an RsaI restriction endonuclease site. (B) Detection of the C1840+T alteration by oligonucleotide hybridization. The autoradiograph shows the binding of two specific oligonucleotide probes, 17-C(h) and 15-T(h) to a 74-bp PCR-amplified product from genomic DNA of MHS individuals 29-3,15-2,32-3, and 40-4 (from top to bottom). Muscle biopsy contracture test results of these individuals are presented in Table 1. Oligonucleotide probe 17-C(h) detects the DNA sequence encoding arginine; oligonucleotide probe 15-T(h) detects the DNA sequence encoding cysteine. Both probes bind to DNA from individual 32-3 (third from the top) who is heterozygous for the C1840+T substitution. In the experiment of which this illustration forms a part, 14 normal and 15 MH individuals were tested. (C) Detection of the C1840+T alteration by detection of loss of an RsaI restriction endonuclease site in the 74-bp PCR product amplified from genomic DNA of individuals from family 32. Cleavage of the 74-bp product generates 41- and 33-bp fragments. Individuals 32-1,32-2, and 32-3 (lanes l-3) are heterozygous. Individuals 32-5 and 32-4 (lanes 4 and 5) are homozygous for the normal (cleaved) sequence. (D) Detection of the C1840+T alteration by direct sequencing using the reverse primer double-overlined in A. The sequence shown corresponds to the noncoding strand of individuals 32-l to 32-5 (lanes l-5 respectively).

Genomic DNA was isolated from blood of MHS and MHN individuals (Miller et al., 1988). A sequence of 74 bp between nucleotides 1808 and 1881 (Fig. 1A) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (Saiki et aZ., 1988) for analysis by either oligonucleotide hybridization or RsaI digestion, using 200-500 ng of genomic DNA and 100 ng of each primer. The forward primer (primer 1) (5’-GTTCCCTGTGTGTGTGTGCAATGGTG - 3’) corresponded to human RYRl cDNA nucleotides 1808 to 1831 with two mismatches (underlined) since the primer was of porcine origin; T for C at position 1809 and C for T at position 1824. The last 24 nucleotides of the reverse primer (primer 2) (5’-ATCTCTAGAGCCAGGGAGCAAGTTCTCAGTAAT-3’) were complementary to nucleotides 1858 to 1881 in human RYRl cDNA, while the first nine contained an XbaI restriction endonuclease site that facilitated subcloning. PCR reaction conditions were denaturation at 94°C for 40 s, annealing at 52°C for 2 min, and extension at 72°C for 3 min for 35 cycles with a final cycle of 7 min at 72°C in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-  Elmer Cetus) using a Mg2+ concentration of 1.5 mA4 in the buffer provided by Perkin-Elmer Cetus. Alternatively, amplification was performed in the buffer described by Kogan et al. (1987) under the following conditions: ramp to 94°C in 30 s, denaturation at 94°C for 40 s, ramp to 58°C in 30 s, annealing at 58°C for 1 min 30 s, ramp to 72°C in 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 2 min 30 s for 35 cycles with a final cycle of 7 min at 72°C in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). For oligonucleotide hybridization analysis, thepresence or absence of the nucleotide substitution in these PCR products was tested by probing with allelespecific oligonucleotides (Fig. 1B). A 17-mer oligonucleotide sequence of the composition 5’-TGGCTGTACGCTCCAAC-3’ (probe 17-C(h)) and a 15-mer oligonucleotide of the composition 5’-GGCTGTATGCTCCAA-3’ (probe 15-T(h)) were synthesized, endlabeled with 32P, and used as hybridization probes to detect the presence of normal and mutant alleles, respectively. These probes were the human analogs of those used successfully for analysis of the corresponding substitution in swine (Fujii et al., 1991). Hy-  SHORT  COMMUNICATION  bridization analysis was as described previously (Fujii et aZ., 1991) except that washing was performed at 59°C for probe 17C(h) and 53’C for probe 15T(h). The restriction endonuclease analysis depended on the observation that the nucleotide substitution altered a restriction site in the DNA. Whereas in the pig the substitution both deletes aHinP1 restriction endonuclease site and creates a HgiAI site (Fujii et al., 1991), in human the alteration of the sequence GTAC1840 to GTAT1840 deletes an RsaI site. Thus digestion of the normal, but not the substituted, 74-bp PCR product with RsaI resulted in products of 41 and 33 bp (Fig. 1C). Restriction analysis was carried out using standard methods and products were separated in 20% polyacrylamide gels. For direct sequencing, a 136-bp product was PCRamplified as described above using the buffer of Kogan et al. (1987), with 100 ng of forward primer 1 and 100 ng of a reverse primer (primer 3) (B-ATCTCTAGACTGGTGGACATAGTTGATGAGG - 3’) (Fig. 1A). The last 24 nucleotides of the reverse primer were complementary to human RYRl cDNA nucleotides 1904 to 1925. The PCR products were purified from agarose according to Heery et al. (1990) and direct sequencing was performed as described by Winship (1989) using reverse primer 3. Screening of MHS and MHN individuals from each of 35 Canadian families predisposed to malignant hyperthermia with the oligonucleotide hybridization and/or RsaI digestion tests led to the identification of three heterozygotes for the C1840+T alteration, all within a single family (Figs. 1B and 1C). Thirty-nine unrelated normal (MHN) individuals were included in this analysis, representing 78 normal (Caucasian) chromosomes, none of which carried the substitution. The substitution in individual 32-3 from the affected family (family 32) was also confirmed by subcloning and single-strand sequencing of nine clones of the 74bp PCR product. Three of the nine clones showed the C to T substitution (data not shown). Further confirmation was provided by direct sequencing of an amplified 136-bp product in all five family members (Figs. 1A and 1D). Individuals 32-1, 32-2, and 32-3 carried the substitution while 32-4 and 32-5 did not. The proband in family 32, a 16-year-old healthy female with no family history of anesthetic problems, had experienced a previous uneventful tonsillectomy with ether as anesthetic. In 1975 she underwent arthroscopy of the right knee for recurrent patella dislocation. Premeditation was with 75 mg Demerol, 25 mg Phenergan, and 0.6 mg atropine; induction was with 250 mg sodium pentothal and 50 mg succinylcholine. Jaw rigidity developed immediately. She was ventilated with 100% 0, and 2% halothane. After 5 min, an additional 30 mg succinylcholine was administered, but masseter spasm continued. Meanwhile, a  753  skin incision had been made. The precordial stethoscope revealed tachycardia and arrhythmia. Halothane was discontinued, therefore, electrocardiogram and temperature monitoring were begun and the surgery was modified. A slight but rapid (0.5”C) increase in temperature was noted, although the electrocardiogram had returned to normal and stayed normal. Anesthesia was maintained with N,O/O, and innovar. Breathing was spontaneous. The remainder of the anesthetic and surgical course, together with testing in the recovery room, were uneventful. Other family members had all undergone previous anesthesia with halothane (but without succinylcholine), apparently without difficulty. Since succinylcholine potentiates halothane contractures in vitro, halothane plus succinylcholine provides a strong trigger that may be required to elicit an MH reaction when the C1840-*T substitution is present in the heterozygous state. Muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis were performed on all family members during 1975-1977. Caffeine and halothane contracture tests were performed essentially as described previously (MacLennan et al., 1990), but at 22”C, necessitating correction to conform with current standards. The results are summarized in Table 1. The 1% halothane contracture test triggered a contracture in the proband’s sister. The halothane (H) test is the least sensitive test and was performed with 1% halothane rather than the more potent 3% halothane in current use. It is thus not surprising that only one individual was positive for this test. The caffeine (C) contracture test results demonstrate that the proband and her sister are susceptible to MH, her mother is on the borderline between MH susceptible and normal, and her father and brother are normal. The caffeine plus halothane (K) test results in the proband, her mother and her sister, are consistent with susceptibility to MH, whereas the results for her brother are considered normal and for her father indeterminate. The caffeine plus halothane test is the most sensitive, but attempts to define a unique cutoff between susceptible and normal values result in many false positives. It is thus necessary to define an indeterminate range where individuals are best left undefined. The proband’s father falls into this category. An individual is considered susceptible if at least one test is positive. On the basis of the contracture tests, the proband, her mother and sister, are considered to be MH susceptible, and her father and brother to be normal. Thus, the three individuals diagnosed as MH sensitive are the three who have the Cys for Arg substitution. The existence of additional substitutions in this family that may contribute to the phenotype cannot be excluded. No such differences were observed, however, in the RYRl cDNA from an MH pig where the  754  SHORT  COMMUNICATION  TABLE Muscle  Individual 32-l 32-2 32-3 32-4 32-5 29-3 15-2 40-4  (Mother) (Sister) (Proband) (Father) (Brother) (unrelated) (unrelated) (unrelated)  1% Halothane cd 0 0.8 0 0 0 0.4 0 0.6  biopsy  1 contracture  Caffeine ww  (plus  4.05 2.15 3.25 8.75 6.00 3.30 2.35 2.70  test Caffeine halothane) bw 0.13 0.05 0.22 0.39 0.53 0.18 0.08 0.25  Diagnosis  Arg to Cys substitution  (C)K HCK RCK N N HCK CK HCK  Yes Yes Yes No No No No No  Note. Halothane, caffeine, and halothane plus caffeine contracture test results on muscle biopsies are indicated for each member of family 32 plus the three unrelated individuals described in Fig. 1B. Contractures resulting in less than 0.3 g tension in 1% halothane indicate normality (N) and greater than 0.3 g tension indicate susceptibility (H). Recorded doses of caffeine are those required to raise the resting muscle tension by 1 g in the absence or presence of 1% halothane. Doses of greater than 4 mZ~4 caffeine in the caffeine test indicate normality; doses lower than 4 mZkf indicate susceptibility (C). A borderline result is indicated in parentheses. Doses of caffeine greater than 0.5 m&f caffeine in the presence of halothane indicate normality in the caffeine plus halothane test; doses of less than 0.35 mM caffeine in the presence of halothane indicate susceptibility (K), while those between 0.35 and 0.5 mA4 caffeine are considered indeterminate (1, 9). R indicates an MH reaction.  Cys for Arg substitution alone appears to account for the phenotype (F’ujii et al., 1991). In a companion study (Otsu et al., 1991), none of 197 heterozygous (N/n) pigs with the corresponding mutation responded to a halothane challenge in a manner indistinguishable from their homozygous affected (n/n) siblings. By analogy with the MH pig, a human heterozygous for the substitution of Cys for Arg 614 might be predicted to have a mild phenotype with only a rare response to halothane alone, in line with the weak response to halothane observed in family 32. Conversely a human homozygous for the substitution might be predicted to have a more severe phenotype, corresponding to the 94% of n/n pigs that responded to a halothane challenge with fulminant MH (Otsu et al., 1991). Humans with a more severe phenotype, in families with dominant, chromosome 19 linked segregation for predisposition to MH, might be expected to be heterozygous for mutations in the RYRl gene more deleterious than the nucleotide substitution reported here. A major goal in human MH research is development of a noninvasive and accurate test for this genetic disease that can be carried out prior to anesthesia. The first step in the development of such a genetic test is the identification of mutations in the responsible gene. The identification of the Cys for Arg 614 substitution in the ryanodine receptor and its cosegregation with susceptibility to MH provides a strong motive for continuing the detailed systematic search for alterations in the RYRl gene in individuals predisposed to MH, on the assumption that this and other mutations in this gene are a major cause of MH.

The skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene has been linked to porcine and human MH. Furthermore, a Cys for Arg substitution tightly linked to, and potentially causative of, porcine MH has been identified in the ryanodine receptor. Analysis of 35 human families predisposed to malignant hyperthermia has revealed the presence, and cosegregation with phenotype, of the corresponding substitution in a single family. This substitution, by analogy to the findings in pig, may be causal for predisposition to MH in this family.A substitution of cysteine for arginine 614 in the ryanodine receptor is potentially causative of human malignant hyperthermia."

In the majority of! I MSN I families. linkage studies locali1ed the gene (C:\1T I a) to the pcricentromeric region of chromosome 17. We have detected with probe pVAW ..09R3 (D17S122) localized in 17p 11.2 a duplication. co-segregating with the disease in 12 H MSN I families. In these families the duplication was present in all 12X patients but absent in the 8.. unafli:cted and 44 married-in individuals (lod score of 5X.44 at zero recombination). Further. on one H :'v1SN I familv the disease newly appeared simultaneously with a c/c nm·o duplication originating from an un~qual crossing-over event at meiosis. Since dillcrent allelic combinations were found segregating with the duplication in dilli:rent families linkage disequilibrium was not a significant factor. These findings led us to propose that the duplication in 17p 11.2 itself is the disease causing mutation in all the II MSN I families analyzed.

In general, the disease is characterized by slowly progressive weakness and atrophy of the distal limb muscles. The disease prevalence has been estimated from population-based series of children aged 2-15 yr in south-west Sweden as 191 100,000 [2] and of all cases in northern Spain as 28.2/100.000 (3].

Patients show pes cavus, depressed or absent deep tendon reflexes. markedly reduced nerve conduction velocities (NCV) and a segmental pattern of extensive de- and remyclination with onion bulb formation in sural nerve biopsy. The clinical severity varies considerably with some patients showing no symptoms while others have severe foot-drop and foot deformities at an older age. Asymptomatic patients can be identified by nerve conduction examination. Although a few sporadic and recessive cases have been reported most HMSN I patients inherited the disease in an autosomal dominant manner (4). Linkage studies have provided evidence for genetic heterogeneity in autosomal dominant HMSN I. In some families linkage was observed with the Duffy blood group on chromosome I [57]. In one of these families conclusive evidence was obtained for a gene (CMT I b) located in lq22-q23 [S]. In the majority of the families linkage was dctcccd with chromosome 17 DNA markers (6.7.912].

Further. our results show that  in most. if not all. of the HMS:\ I families the duplication is the result of an unequal crossingover event at meiosis. At present. it is not dear yet whether the duplication directly interrupts a gene with a primary function in the peripheral nervous system or merely creates a third copy of the same gene resulting in a gene dosage effect. Our results seem to be in disagreement with published data indicating recombination between CMT Ia and probe pVAW409R3 [15]. This inconsistency can be explained by the observation that the duplication if not rt.'Cognited. may obscure linkage data. For example. in patients heterozygous for the Mspl polymorphism. one of the duplicated alleles may be classified incorrectly as originating from the healthy parent. Possibly. the reported rccom-  Charcot Marie-Tooth Type Ia  binants are the result of such misclassifications. However, we cannot yet exclude that in some chromosome 17 linked HMSN I families other genetic defects than a duplication may be present. The finding of a fully disease-associated duplication in HMSN I patients has important implications for the future localization. isolation and identification of the CMT Ia gene. Indeed, in other diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and neurofibromatosis, chromosomal alterations have proven to be extremely helpful serving as markpoints for the disease gene. At present the exact size of the duplication in HMSN I patients is not known. No junction fragments were observed with probes pVAW409R3 and pVAW409RI on standard Southern blots so that further studies are focusing on defining the size of the duplication using pulsed field gel electrophoresis and cytogenetic analysis. Our observation has immediate implications for the DNA diagnosis of HMSN I patients since the duplication can be detected relatively easily, circumventing the need for linkage studies in the patient's family. Previously, DNA diagnosis was restricted to a few large and informative families since HMSN I is genetically heterogeneous with at least two different chromosomal loci involved. In addition, screening for the duplication may contribute to the differential diagnosis in H M SN. Further, it will be interesting to review the clinical and histological characteristics of duplication positive HMSN I patients to see whether they differ phenotypically from other HMSN I patients.

In the majority of HMSN I families, linkage studies localized the gene (CMT 1a) to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. We have detected with probe pVAW409R3 (D17S122) localized in 17p11.2 a duplication, co-segregating with the disease in 12 HMSN I families. In these families the duplication was present in all 128 patients but absent in the 84 unaffected and 44 married-in individuals (lod score of 58.44 at zero recombination). Further, on one HMSN I family the disease newly appeared simultaneously with a de novo duplication originating from an unequal crossing-over event at meiosis. Since different allelic combinations were found segregating with the duplication in different families linkage disequilibrium was not a significant factor. These findings led us to propose that the duplication in 17p11.2 itself is the disease causing mutation in all the HMSN I families analyzed."

Three FH-patients were found to have a deletion. Two of these delete part of the cysteine rich domain, which comprises the ligand binding region of the LDLreceptor. The third deletion encompasses coding regions for the cytoplasmic part of the receptor.

To our knowledge, a total of 29 deletions have been reported, including the three described in the present paper (summarized in Table 1). The diversity of mutations responsible for FH has complicated the development of molecular assays to diagnose mutations at this locus. In some populations, however, a founder effect has been described with a  specific mutation accounting for up to 60% of the genetic defects in FH-subjects (Hobbs et al. 1987). Familial hypercholesterolemia in Denmark has been the subject of several previous studies (Kornerup 1948, Jensen et al. 1967, Johansen et al. 1982).

Cleaved DNA was sizefractionated by gel-electrophoresis through a 0.7% agarose gel. Southern blotting onto Zeta membrane (Bio-Rad) was performed at room temperature for 20 h. After the end of the transfer, the Zeta membrane was neutralized and dried in air before baking at 80°C in a vacuum oven.

FH-DK2, the Deletion in Family 2 Screening with XbaI and BglII located the gene rearrangement in Family 2 to the 5' half of the gene. The size of the deleted sequence could be estimated from these data to be approximately 9 kb, decreasing the 23 kb XbaI fragment to 14 kb (Fig. 4). The data from BglII, EcoRI (not shown) and EcoRV (Fig. 4) cleavages locate the downstream deletion break point to 5' of the 6 kb EcoRV fragment (Fig. 2). Double digests with EcoRV and KpnI hybridized with the 5'-1.7 probe reveal that the KpnI site in intron 2 is lost (not shown) and the 5' crossover point of the deletion must therefore be located upstream from the KpnI site. Because the distance between the KpnI and EcoRV sites is about 10 kb, and intron 7 is only about 0.45 kb, it seems likely that the 3' crossover point of the deletion lies upstream from exon 7. Since neither the EcoRI site in exon 5 nor the EcoRI site in intron 6 are present, it can be deduced that the 5' break point of the deletion is located in intron 2. This deletion of 9 kb has thus removed exon 3-6. FH-DK 3 the Deletion in Family 3 Screening with XbaI and BglII unambiguously located the gene variation in Family  3 within the borders of the BglII 13 kb fragment (Fig. 5). The aberration became obvious upon cleavage with EcoRI (Fig. 5). In addition to the normal bands of 9 and 19 kb, an additional band of about 11 kb appeared. Such a fragment could either be the product of a point mutation in the EcoRI site in intron 6 or the result of an alteration of a fragment encompassing the EcoRI site in exon 5. However, it can be deduced from the combined BglII and EcoRI analyses that the genetic variant found in IP and JP is a deletion of 1 kb which removes exon 5. Discussion  The molecular basis of familial hyprcholesterolemia has been studied by several research groups. The studies have disclosed a large genetic heterogeneity of mutations at the LDL-R gene locus. Most of the characterized mutations in this gene are deletions and insertions (summarized in Table l), but duplications and point mutations have also been reported (Lehrman et al. 1987a). It is generally agreed that the LDL-R gene is particularly susceptible to deletions, assumed to be caused by mispairing of homologous chromosomes and unequal crossing  457  DELETIONS I N THE LDL-RECEPTOR GENE  Xba I 1 2 3  23 kb  Pvu II  w k jr  10kb  1  2  3  ~  4  5  kb -16.5 kb '14.0 kb -17.5  -3c*  Exon 1112  1314  15  16 17  18  f i wtv t t t t t 3'  P  X  @xxxPP  P  P+  x  XbaI ( x )  PVUII (PI  d)  t--, m2kb  FIg. 3.

The ) Lebanese allele (Lehrman et al. 1 9 8 7 ~ is caused by a single nucleotide substitution, that creates a premature termination codon. This mutation has resulted in a more than  10-fold higher frequency of the homozyogous conditions than is found in other populations. In the Afrikaner population of South Africa, two different single nucleotide substitutionsaccount for 95% of the mutant  460  RoDlGER ET AL.  LDL-receptor genes (Leitersdorf et al. 1989). The presence of a founder gene in a localized population may contribute to differences in the proportion of deletions relative to single base pair mutations found in different areas. The stringency of the clinical diagnosis FH may also have great impact on all frequency estimates made for defects in the LDL-R-gene. Our FH diagnosis was based on rather strict criteria (including hypercholesterolemia), requiring tendon xanthomas in the proband or in first-degree relatives and a family history of premature atherosclerosis. The data presented in Table 2 sustain the validity of these criteria, as the clinical traits of the FH diagnosis cosegregated with the genetic findings of a mutated gene. The three different deletions found in this study have been mapped to different sites in the gene using the published restriction map and exon-specific probes (Siidhof et al. 1985, Yamamoto et al. 1984). Deletions found in FH-DK 2 ( -exons 3-6) and FHDK 3 ( -exon 5) delete sequences coding for the cysteine-rich part of the receptor. Because the crossover positions are located in introns and all introncxon junctions of the first 8 exons are in the same translation frame (Siidhof et al. 1985), both the FH-DK 2 and FH-DK 3 deletions are anticipated to produce translatable mRNA's of 4.5 and 5.3 kb, respectively. The molecular weight of the translated non-processed proteins would be expected to decline from 120 kDa to 84 kDa and 115 kDa in FH-DK 2 and FHDK 3, respectively. However, Hobbs et al. (1986) have shown that FH-626 (-exon 5 ) produces a 100 kDa protein, which abolishes binding of ApoB. The same should also hold true for FH-DK 3 and the deletion of exons 3-6 in FH-DK 2. Previous findings have implicated sequences from exon 17 and exon 18 in the process of recycling of the receptor in coated pits  (Goldstein et al. 1985, Davis et al. 1986, Lehnnan et al. 1985a, b). If the FH-DK 1 mRNA splice out the intron sequences correctly, the variant mRNA will be out of the correct translation frame from the junction point of exon 16 and exon 18. The resulting protein will be three aminoacids shorter and have a quite different C-terminal aminoacid composition. We anticipate that this results in a nonfunctional receptor of a different length. The deletions found in FH-DK 1 and 3 are most interesting, as these may turn out to be equivalent to deletions found by others (Hobbs et al. 1986, Horsthemke et al. 1987a, Langlois et al. 1988). Precise characterization of the deletion found in FH-DK 3 is in progress in our laboratory. Of the deletions characterized, six have been defined at the molecular level. Five of these are the result of recombination between repetitive elements found at the deletion breakpoint. The duplication of exons 2-8 reported by Lehrman et al. (1987a), FH-295, was also the result of an Alu-Alu recombination. Alu repeats are found in high numbers in introns 1-8 and 12-17 and in a lower frequency in introns 9-1 1 (Langlois et al. 1988). Taken together, these findings together with the observed clustering of major rearrangements in the S-end and Y-end of the gene (Fig. 1) support the notion that Alu-Alu recombination is the most common mechanism for major rearrangements in the LDL-receptor gene. Deletion of exon 5 is now reported to be present in at least three (FH-626, PO/JA, FH-DK 3) out of 30 reported cases of gross LDL-receptor gene rearrangements. Characterization of these three deletions may give additional information about the mechanism of recombination and possible hotspot cross-over points in this gene. We have therefore initiated complete characterization of FH-DK 3 to determine the exact breakpoint in this deletion.  DELETIONS I N THE LDL-RECEPTOR GENE Acknowledgement  We appreciate the technical assistance of Margrethe Jerrgensen and Inge Lund.

Three FH-patients were found to have a deletion. Two of these delete part of the cysteine rich domain, which comprises the ligand binding region of the LDL-receptor. The third deletion encompasses coding regions for the cytoplasmic part of the receptor. As two of these deletions could be equivalent to previously described LDL-receptor gene alterations, these data seem to support a notion of recombination hot spots which involve Alu-sequences."
"1","The spectrum of genetic defects in a panel of 40 Dutch families with symptomatic protein C deficiency type I: heterogeneity and founder effects.RAPID COMMUNICATION  The Spectrum of Genetic Defects in a Panel of 40 Dutch Families With Symptomatic Protein C Deficiency Type I: Heterogeneity and Founder Effects By P.H. Reitsma, S.R. Poort, C.F. Allaart, E. Briet, and R.M. Bertina Heterozygosity for protein C deficiency is associated with thromboembolic episodes, but clinical symptoms are nonrandomly distributed among protein C deficient families. This finding has led to the provisional definition of clinically dominant and clinically recessive protein C deficiency. We report here the molecular basis of hereditary, clinically dominant protein C deficiency in a panel of 40 Dutch probands from apparently independent families. All but one subject was a heterozygote for a point mutation in the protein C gene. These 39 subjects shared 15 mutations, six of which occurred in more than one proband (between two and nine).  The diversity in the 15 mutations, together with the observation that the most frequent Dutch mutation was also found in a Swedish family with clinically recessive protein C deficiency, makes it unlikely that the molecular basis of protein C deficiency will be different between the clinically dominant and recessive forms. The recurrence of one of the mutations is most likely due to a founder effect, which suggests that when an additional hereditaryfactor is involved in the clinical severity of protein C deficiency this factor may remain linked to the protein C gene over many generations. 0 1991 by The American Society of Hematology.  T  These findings contrast sharply with two sets of data that do not support a strong association between heterozygosity for protein C deficiency and thrombotic disease. First, there is the observation that in many instances severely affected homozygous infants were born from heterozygous parents who have neither a personal predisposition to thrombosis Second, the measurenor a family history of ment of protein C levels in a large panel of 4,723 healthy blood donors resulted in an estimate of the prevalence of heterozygous protein C deficiency in the general population of 1 in 200 to 300.” None of the hereditary protein C-deficient subjects identified in this survey had a personal or family history of thrombosis (clinically recessive protein C deficiency). These two sets of observations strongly suggest that only in a subset of hereditary protein C deficiencies (one in 50 to 80) is the disorder associated with a predisposition to thrombosis. At present, it is unknown which factor(s) influence the apparently nonrandom distribution of thrombotic symptoms among protein C-deficient families. One possibility is that the genetic abnormality is different between clinically dominant and recessive protein C deficiency. Alternatively, some unidentified additional genetic factor may determine the predisposition towards thrombosis.” This factor may cosegregate with protein C deficiency in the symptomatic families, and may have segregated from the protein C defect, at a rate dependent on the genetic distance, in asymptomatic families. To address these issues one needs to know the primary genetic defect that underlies hereditary protein C deficiency in both symptomatic and asymptomatic families. As a first step, we report here the genetic analysis of a panel of 40 probands of Dutch symptomatic families with clinically dominant protein C deficiency type I. In all but one subject a molecular abnormality due to a point mutation was found. Of the 15 distinct mutations shared by these 39 probrands, six occurred in more than one subject and accounted for 75% of the genetic defects. The recurrence of one of these six mutations was found to be due to “identity by descent” and not to independent mutational events. If an additional genetic factor is involved in the predisposition towards thrombosis, our data suggest that this factor may remain linked to the protein C gene defect over many generations.  HE HUMAN BLOOD coagulation cascade is downregulated by a variety of natural anticoagulant mechanisms. Among these mechanisms is the so-called “protein C anticoagulant pathway.”‘ This pathway is initiated when thrombin (generated in the coagulation cascade) binds to the endothelial membrane receptor thrombomodulin. The resulting complex activates the zymogen protein C. Activated protein C in turn inactivates the procoagulant cofactors Va and VIIIa, thereby downregulating the coagulation cascade and limiting the deposition of fibrin. The physiologic importance of the protein C anticoagulant pathway is most dramatically illustrated by the rarely occurring homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for protein C deficiency, which have undetectable levels of protein C activity and/or Such patients suffer from very severe thromboembolic disease and purpura fulminans from the perinatal period onwards. Heterozygotes for protein C deficiency are much more mildly affected.

These patients were originally identified by screening patients with a personal and family history of thrombosis. They all have a type I deficiency, ie, a concordant reduction of protein C activity and antigen. The laboratory diagnosis was made using criteria previously described.'* In nine cases, only the DNA of the proband was available for analysis. In the other cases, DNA from normal and deficient family members was available for analysis of the cosegregation of the genetic defect with the deficiency. The strategy for identifying mutations focussed on finding alterations in the coding sequence of the protein C gene and made use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).I3 Primers used in the PCR were derived from the genomic sequence (Table l),L4,'5 and were chosen such that each amplified fragment contained the entire coding sequence plus splice junctions of an exon. The conditions used in the PCR were as follows: 0.7 minutes of denaturation at 95"C, 1minute of annealing at 50"C, and 2 minutes of extension at either 63°C (exons 1,2,3,6,7, and 8), 65°C (exons 4 and 5), or 70°C (exon 9). Further reaction conditions were as described before.16 After the PCR, the complete reaction mixture was run at 4°C on an ultra-low gelling temperature agarose gel and the segment of the gel containing the amplified fragment was excised. Without further purification, 1to 5 FL of the gel slice was heated at 95°C for 4 minutes and used as DNA template in a commercially available DNA-sequencing kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) as described before." For each of the mutations reported here, all nine regions were sequenced to exclude the possibility of more than one sequence abnormality. However, when a particular mutation was found in more than one proband the sequencing of all nine exons was performed only in the first. RESULTS  Of the 40 protein C-deficient probands in this study, 39 were found to be heterozygous for a point mutation in the protein C gene (Table 2 ) . These 39 subjects shared 15  distinct mutations that varied from splice site and nonsense mutations, which putatively alter normal splicing and translation, to missense mutations of which the relationship to the type I protein C deficiency is not immediately clear. In addition, the proband from family PC44 was not only heterozygous for a '32Gln--* Stop but also for an apparently rare but neutral sequence abnormality in the codon for 17*Arg(CGG + CGA) that did not cosegregate with the protein C deficiency. Notably, this latter observation raises the possibility that investigators are dealing in part with rare but neutral amino acid sequence variations rather than with mutations that are directly responsible for the protein C deficiency. To minimize this possibility we made certain that the protein C gene sequences that are amplified by the primer sets in Tabe 1 did not contain a second abnormality. In addition, when DNA from normal and deficient family members was available, we compared the inheritance of the protein C deficiency with that of the genetic abnormality. To simplify this analysis, use was made of the finding that 11 of the 15 mutations are readily detectable from an altered digestion pattern for particular restriction enzymes (Table 2). In the remaining cases, the genetic abnormality was monitored by a sequence analysis. For all but three mutations, DNA was available from family members (varying from two to more than 60) for this type of analysis, and invariably cosegregation of protein C deficiencywith the mutation was observed. Six of the 15 mutations were found in more than one independent proband. Two of these ('"Cys + Tyr and 40311e + Met) occurred two times and one (76Phe+ Leu) occurred three times. The remaining three mutations ("'Arg + Cys, I3'Gln + Stop, and "Arg -+ Stop) were considerably more frequent and recurred nine, nine, and five times, respectively.

In the case of independent mutational events, their high frequency may be due to hotspots for mutation like the CpG dinucleotides" that are involved in the 230Arg Cys and 'O6Arg -+ Stop mutations. To decide which of the two mechanisms is most likely responsible for the recurrent mutations, one may take geographic and ethnic information into consideration and perform a haplotype analysis of the defective allele. We have previously reported the cosegregation of the M6Arg-+ Stop mutation with a rare intragenic Msp I restriction site polymorphism in three of the five families with the "'Arg Stop mutation." Similarly, the two families that are added in this report carry the %Arg -+  -+  -+  Stop mutation on the rare Msp I allele (data not shown). Because such a linkage between a particular mutation and a rare polymorphism argues against the independent origin of the mutation^'^ we attempted a genealogic investigation of the five families. As shown in Fig 1,by going back to 1757 we found a common ancestor for three of the probands. The remaining two families could not be linked to this pedigree because of a foundling and an unmarried mother in the ancestry. In addition to the abnormalities in Table 2 and the neutral abnormality in the codon for "'Arg, three apparently neutral and frequent sequence variations were found. The first polymorphism is an A + T transversion at nucleo-  GENETIC DEFECTS IN PROTEIN C DEFICIENCY  893  1729  1  7  F  1  1948  7  A  1984  1973  4  Fig 1.

The second polymorphism is a T + G transversion in the triplet coding for 99Ser (TCT -+ TCG, also Ser) with allelic frequencies of 59% (T) and 41% (G) (78 alleles tested). The third polymorphism is a C -+ T transition in the triplet coding for *I4Asp (GAT+GAC) with allelic frequencies of 67% (T) and 33% (C) (78 x alleles tested). This latter polymorphism, which specifies Asp in both sequences, was already predicted by Foster et all4from a difference between a cDNA and a genomic sequence. DISCUSSION  The main aim of this study was to establish the genetic basis of clinically dominant protein C deficiency type I in a representative panel of probands from symptomatic families. The results indicate that although there is a considerable heterogeneity in the genetic abnormalities, some of the mutations predominate. It came as a surprise that 10 of the 15 mutations that are each associated with a type I deficiency predict amino acid replacements. We had expected that a larger proportion of the mutations would lead to stop codons, frameshifts, or splice site abnormalities. Even though we observed a neutral abnormality in the codon for ”‘Arg, it is unlikely that all of these missense mutations also represent rare but neutral variants of protein C because each was the only mutation observed in the protein C genes of a particular proband, and because invariably cosegregation of a type I protein C deficiencywith the genetic defect was observed in the family of the proband. It may be that some of the aminoacid replacements result in the improper folding of the protein C zymogen and that these aberrant molecules are removed from the endoplasmatic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus before secretion through a mechanism that  involves so-called “chaperone” proteins.2o”’Alternatively, some of the abnormalities that we classify as a missense mutation may actually be a splite site mutation. For instance, the ’19Ser-+Arg replacement results from a C + C G mutation in the sequence. . . AG & TGTGC. . . The G newly generated sequence closely resembles the consensus A of a donor splice site AG GT AGT,” and if actually used G would lead not only to an aberrantly spliced RNA but also to a frameshift. Given the spectrum of mutations in clinically dominant protein C deficiency it is difficult to imagine how these may differ qualitatively from the mutations in clinically recessive protein C deficiency. Many homozygotes born from heterozygous parents without a personal or family history of thrombosis have undetectable levels of protein C. This level of protein C would be compatible with any of the stop codons we found in our panel. Because we have not identified any asymptomatic families in the Dutch population we are not able to test such individuals for the presence of any of the mutations that we report here. We can add, however, that we have identified a 230Arg+ Cys mutation (which occurred nine times in our panel) in a Swedish compound heterozygote that was born from parents without a personal or family history of thrombosisz3(Reitsma et al, unpublished). This finding clearly indicates that, indeed, no qualitative difference in the mutations between symptomatic and asymptomatic families will be found. The proposal that comparable genetic defects underlie protein C deficiency in symptomatic and asymptomatic families is at odds with the terms clinically dominant and clinically recessive protein C deficiency. These terms suggest that the two forms of deficiency constitute distinct genetic entities. However, until it is established which additional factor(s) determine the susceptibility of a protein C-deficient subject to the development of thrombosis, these terms may remain useful to distinguish the protein C-deficient individuals as they have been claimed to abound in the general population from those that are members of thrombophilic families. These latter individuals, unlike their counterparts in the population at large, carry the protein C deficiency as a dominant marker for increased thrombotic risk. With respect to the hypothesis that a second abnormality cosegregates with protein C deficiency in the symptomatic individuals,’.” the results from the genealogic investigation presented in Fig 1 are intriguing. One way of interpreting these results is that they show that such a hypothetical factor remains linked to the protein C deficiency over many generations and, therefore, should map relatively close to the protein C gene on chromosome 2. The implication of such an interpretation is that the hypothetical factor is not a coagulation protein because all of these have been localized on other chromosomes and any abnormality in these proteins should segregate rapidly from the protein C deficiency. The only exception is the gene for the lipoproteinassociated coagulation inhibitor (LACI) that has recently  a94  REITSMA ET AL  been mapped on chromosome 2q31-32,24which is, however, relatively distant from the protein C locus 2q13-14.= In the families in which we have identified the genetic abnormality underlying the type I protein C deficiency it will be relatively simple to screen the family for the presence of heterozygotes. At present, the diagnosis relies on assays of protein C antigen and/or activity. However, occasionally this reliance on protein C levels will lead to a misdiagnosis because on the one hand there is an overlap between the plasma levels of normals and heterozygotes and on the other hand there are many patients in which one considers a diagnosis who are taking oral anticoagulants, a treatment that in itself will result in a decrease of the protein C level. By adding a genetic test one can now unequivockbly assign a subject to either the normal or the deficiency group and estimate precisely the correlation between the protein C deficiency and thrombosis. This  study is now underway at our institute for the families described in this report.

This finding has led to the provisional definition of clinically dominant and clinically recessive protein C deficiency. We report here the molecular basis of hereditary, clinically dominant protein C deficiency in a panel of 40 Dutch probands from apparently independent families. All but one subject was a heterozygote for a point mutation in the protein C gene. These 39 subjects shared 15 mutations, six of which occurred in more than one proband (between two and nine). The diversity in the 15 mutations, together with the observation that the most frequent Dutch mutation was also found in a Swedish family with clinically recessive protein C deficiency, makes it unlikely that the molecular basis of protein C deficiency will be different between the clinically dominant and recessive forms. The recurrence of one of the mutations is most likely due to a founder effect, which suggests that when an additional hereditary factor is involved in the clinical severity of protein C deficiency this factor may remain linked to the protein C gene over many generations."
"1","Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease both result from the deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, acid sphingomyelinase (E.C. 3.1.4.12). Type A Niemann-Pick disease is a severe neurodegenerative disorder of infancy which leads to death by three years of age, whereas Type B disease has a later age at onset, little or no neurologic involvement, and most patients survive into adulthood. To investigate the molecular basis for the remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity, the nature of the mutations causing Type B Niemann-Pick disease in Ashkenazi Jewish patients was determined. The entire acid sphingomyelinase coding region from an Ashkenazi Jewish Type B patient was polymerase chain reaction-amplified, subcloned, and completely sequenced. A three-base deletion was identified of nucleotides 1821-1823 in the cDNA which predicted the removal of an arginine residue from position 608 of the acid sphingomyelinase polypeptide (delta R608). The other cDNA clones from this patient had the R496L mutation previously identified in Type A Niemann-Pick disease patients. Both Ashkenazi Jewish Type B patients were heteroallelic for the delta R608 mutation, whereas this allele was not present in 15 unrelated non-Jewish Type B patients, with the notable exception of one mildly affected patient of Arabic descent who was homoallelic for the delta R608 mutation. These results indicate that the delta R608 mutation predicts the Type B Niemann-Pick disease phenotype, even in the presence of the R496L Type A allele, thereby providing the first genotype/phenotype correlation for this lysosomal storage disease. Although only two patients have been studied, it appears that the delta R608 mutation occurs frequently in Type B Niemann-Pick disease patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.Niemann-Pick Type B Disease Identification of a Single Codon Deletion in the Acid Sphingomyelinase Gene and Genotype/Phenotype Correlations in Type A and B Patients Oma Levran, Robert J.

Type A Niemann-Pick disease is a severe neurodegenerative disorder of infancy which leads to death by three years of age, whereas Type B disease has a later age at onset, little or no neurologic involvement, and most patients survive into adulthood.

Type A Niemann-Pick disease is a severe neurodegenerative disorder ofinfancy characterized by progressive psychomotor retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, and death by three years of age. In contrast, Type B Niemann-Pick disease is a nonneuronopathic disorder characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, respiratory involvement, and survival into adulthood. In addition, a third form of Niemann-Pick disease, Type C, has been described (5). However, since most of the patients with Type C Niemann-Pick disease have a defect in cholesterol esterification, it is unlikely that this form of the disease results from primary lesions in the acid sphingomyelinase gene. The clinical course of patients with Type A disease is quite uniform, whereas the severity among Type B patients is more variable. In fact, some mildly affected Type B patients may survive into the sixth decade of life (5). Both types occur more frequently among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (- 1/40,000) than in the general population (7); however, mass screening for carrier detection in this population has been precluded due to the marked overlap of acid sphingomyelinase activities in leukocytes from obligate heterozygotes and normal individuals. To date, biochemical investigations into the genetic heterogeneity underlying the neuronopathic Type A and nonneuronopathic Type B phenotypes have been limited since acid sphingomyelinase is difficult to purify, the commonly used enzymatic assays are insensitive and labor intensive, and monospecific antibodies have been difficult to produce (8-10). In general, Type A Niemann-Pick disease patients tend to have slightly lower residual activities in crude cell and tissue homogenates than Type B patients; however, the residual activities have not been well characterized (2, 5, 11, 12). Similarly, all of the Type A and B Niemann-Pick disease patients studied to date have had cross-reactive immunologic material in crude cell homogenates; however, accurate estimates of the amount of enzyme protein have not been determined (13, 14). In contrast, investigations into the molecular nature of the genetic heterogeneity in Niemann-Pick disease have been facilitated by the recent isolation and characterization of the fulllength cDNA encoding human acid sphingomyelinase (15, 16). The 2347-bp cDNA contained an open reading frame of 1890bp which encoded a 629-residue polypeptide containing six potential N-glycosylation sites. The availability of the cDNA permitted the localization of the acid sphingomyelinase gene to the chromosomal region 1 lpl 5.1-15.4 by the use of somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization techniques (17). Studies also have been undertaken to determine the nature of the genetic lesions causing Type A Niemann-Pick disease. By sequencing polymerase chain reaction (PCR)'-amplified acid 1.

The R496L mutation was found in about onethird of the Ashkenazi Jewish Type A Niemann-Pick disease alleles studied; in contrast, only about 6.0% of the alleles from non-Jewish Type A patients had this mutation. Some Type A patients were homoallelic for the R496L mutation, while others were heteroallelic, indicating the occurrence of other acid sphingomyelinase mutations that caused the Type A phenotype. Interestingly, the R496L mutation also was detected in one of the two Ashkenazi Jewish Type B patients studied. Thus, efforts were undertaken to determine the molecular lesion in the other acid sphingomyelinase allele ofthe Ashkenazi Jewish Type B patient who was heteroallelic for the R496L mutation. In this communication, we report the identification of a three-base deletion in the acid sphingomyelinase coding region from this Type B Niemann-Pick disease patient (proband 2) that results in the deletion of codon 608, which encoded an arginine residue (designated AR608). Notably, both of the unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish Type B patients analyzed were heteroallelic for the AR608 mutation and one of the 15 unrelated non-Jewish Type B patients studied was homoallelic. The absence of the AR608 mutation in 67 Type A Niemann-Pick disease alleles suggested that the AR608 lesion resulted in the Type B phenotype, even when heteroallelic with the R496L Type A mutation, thus providing the first genotype/phenotype correlation for Niemann-Pick disease.  Methods Cell lines. Primary cultures of fibroblasts and lymphoblasts were established from skin biopsies and peripheral blood samples obtained with informed consent from Niemann-Pick disease patients and family members, and from normal individuals. Niemann-Pick disease lines GMOO1 12A, GM00165, GM00370, GM00406, GM00559, GM02895, and GM03252 were obtained from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository, Camden, NJ.

The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, and 1 mg/ml streptomycin by standard procedures (18). The diagnosis of Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease was based on clinical criteria (e.g., age at onset, presence of neurologic involvement, etc.) and by demonstration of markedly deficient acid sphingomyelinase activity in cultured cells (8). Clinical data on probands 1 and 2 have been published (3, 19), and information on proband 3 was provided by Dr. M. Vanier, Department of Biochemistry, Faculte de Medecine, Lyon, France. Enzyme and protein assays. Acid sphingomyelinase activity was determined in cultured fibroblasts obtained from Niemann-Pick disease patients and normal individuals using the fluorescent natural substrate, [N- 12(l -pyrenesulfonyl)amido dodecanoyl] sphingomyelin (PSA12-sphingomyelin) as previously described (8). 1 U of activity equals that amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 nmol of substrate per h. Protein determinations were performed by a modified fluorescamine assay (20).  cDNA and genomic amplification and sequencing. For acid sphingomyelinase cDNA amplification and sequencing, total RNA was isolated from cultured cells by standard procedures (21). First-strand cDNA was synthesized with reverse transcriptase from - 5 Ag of total RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim Corp., Indianapolis, IN). The acid sphingomyelinase cDNA (- 10%l6 of the total reaction) was PCR-amplified (22) with Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT) using the previously described oligonucleotide primers (18). PCR was performed for 30 cycles, each consisting of denaturation for 1 min at 940C and annealing and extension for 4 min at 720C. After amplification, the PCR products were isolated from agarose gels and subcloned into either Bluescript KS (+) (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) or pGEM 9Zf (-) (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) vectors. For each amplified product, from 4 to 10 independent subclones were sequenced in both orientations by the dideoxy method (23). To confirm the candidate mutation, genomic DNA was isolated from the proband (21) and a 567-bp genomic fragment containing the mutation was PCR-amplified using sense (5'-AGTAGTCGACATGGGCAGGATGTGTGG-3') and antisense (Y-AGTAGTGTCGACTTGCCTGGTTGAACCACAGC-3') primers synthesized on a DNA Synthesizer (model 380B; Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) (24). The amplified genomic fragment was isolated, subcloned, and sequenced as described above for the PCR-amplified acid sphingomyelinase cDNAs. Dot-blot analysis ofthe mutant alleles. For detection of the AR608 mutation in other Niemann-Pick disease patients, their parents and relatives, as well as normal individuals, total genomic DNA was isolated, PCR-amplified as described above, and the 567-bp acid sphingomyelinase product was analyzed by dot-blot hybridization using Zetabind nylon membranes (AMF-Cuno, Meriden, CT) and a dot-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). Hybridizations ofthe PCR product with the normal allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) (5'-CTCTGTGCCGCCACCTG-3') or with the AR608 ASO (5'GCTCTGTGCCACCTGAT-3') were performed for at least 3 h at 39°C. 5' end-labeling of the ASOs with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [y-32P]ATP (> 5,000 Ci/mmol) was performed by standard procedures (21). After hybridization, the blots were washed at room temperature for 15 min in 6X SSC containing 0.1% SDS, and then for 2 h in the same solution at either 54°C for the normal ASO or 50°C for the AR608 ASO. Dot-blot analysis of the R496L mutation was performed as previously described (19).  Results Identification of the AR608 mutation in an Ashkenazi Jewish patient with Type B Niemann-Pick disease. Previous studies of an Ashkenazi Jewish Type B Niemann-Pick disease patient (proband 2; cell line MS 1271) indicated that he had - 5-8% residual acid sphingomyelinase activity and that he was heteroallelic for the R496L mutation (19). To identify the molecular lesion in his other acid sphingomyelinase allele, total RNA from the proband was reverse-transcribed, the acid sphingomyelinase coding region was PCR-amplified, and the PCR products were subcloned into plasmid vectors for DNA sequencing. A three-base deletion (CCG) of nucleotides 18211823 in the full-length acid sphingomyelinase cDNA (16) was identified which predicted the removal of a single arginine residue at position 608 of the acid sphingomyelinase polypeptide (designated AR608). The authenticity of this deletion was determined by genomic sequencing (Fig. 1) and by dot-blot hybridization of PCR-amplified genomic DNA from proband 2 and other family members using an ASO specific for the AR608 mutation (Fig. 2). In addition, dot-blot hybridizations confirmed the AR608/R496L genotype of proband 2, and demGenetic Heterogeneity in Types A and B Niemann-Pick Disease  807  Figure 1.

Proband 2's brother did not receive either mutant acid sphingomyelinase allele. The AR608 mutation was not identified in over 100 acid sphingomyelinase alleles from normal individuals, indicating that the deletion was not a polymorphism. Occurrence of the AR608 mutation in types A and B Niemann-Pick disease. Table I shows the occurrence ofthe AR608 mutation in the acid sphingomyelinase alleles of other patients and obligate heterozygotes with Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease, as determined by dot-blot analysis of PCR-amplified genomic DNA. Interestingly, a second, unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish Type B Niemann-Pick disease patient was heteroallelic for the AR608 mutation and another, unknown mutant acid sphingomyelinase allele. Of the 15 non-Jewish Type B patients studied only one, an Arab from Algeria (proband 3; cell line 534R.F03), was homoallelic for this mutation. This 2 1-yr old male has a mild Type B phenotype (Vanier, M. T., personal communication). Of the 67 acid sphingomyelinase alleles from Type A Niemann-Pick disease patients or obligate heterozygotes (26 and 19 unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish and non-Jewish individuals, respectively), none had the AR608 mutation.  Comparison of the residual acid sphingomyelinase activities in Type A and B Niemann-Pick disease patients. Table II shows the acid sphingomyelinase activities in cultured fibroblasts from probands 1, 2, and 3, which were determined using the fluorescent natural substrate, PSA12-sphingomyelin. Normal individuals had a mean activity of46.3 nmol cleaved/h per mg. In contrast, Type A proband 1, who was homoallelic for R496L, had < 1% of normal activity. Type B proband 2, whose genotype was R496L/AR608, had a residual activity of 5% of normal, whereas proband 3 who was homoallelic for AR608 had - 13% of normal mean acid sphingomyelinase activity, indicating that the AR608 allele expressed functional acid sphingomyelinase activity in a dosage-dependent manner. -  Discussion In 1966, Brady et al. reported that the primary enzymatic defect in Type A Niemann-Pick disease was the deficient activity of acid sphingomyelinase (1). In the following year, Schneider and Kennedy demonstrated that acid sphingomyelinase activity also was markedly decreased in patients with the milder, visceral form of Niemann-Pick disease now known as Type B disease (2). Subsequent biochemical analyses of additional patients confirmed these findings (10-12) and somatic cell genetic studies demonstrated that the mutations causing Types A and B disease were allelic (6). These findings stimulated investigators to speculate that the remarkable clinical heterogeneity observed among Type A and B Niemann-Pick disease patients  Table II.

However, efforts to reliably predict either the disease subtype or the severity of Type B patients by the amount of residual acid sphingomyelinase activity have not been possible, in part due to the inability of assay procedures to accurately distinguish between patients with low levels of residual acid sphingomyelinase activity and/or the presence of the neutral sphingomyelinase activity in cell homogenates (25). In addition, the inability to reliably discriminate obligate heterozygotes for Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease from noncarriers by the determination of acid sphingomyelinase activity in isolated leukocytes has precluded carrier screening for Niemann-Pick disease. The recent cloning and sequencing of the acid sphingomyelinase cDNA (15, 16) has permitted identification of the first mutations which result in Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease. Previously, the R496L mutation, due to a single G to T transversion, was found in 32% of the Ashkenazi Jewish Type A Niemann-Pick disease alleles studied. In contrast, it was present in only 5.6% of the non-Jewish Type A alleles analyzed (19). In addition, proband 2, an Ashkenazi Jewish Type B Niemann-Pick disease patient was found to be heteroallelic for the R496L mutation. In our study, a three-base deletion (AR608) in the acid sphingomyelinase gene was identified as the other mutation in proband 2. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the three-base deletion, CCG, removed the last nucleotide of codon Cys-607 (TGC) and the first two nucleotides of codon Arg-608 (CGC). The new codon 607 formed by this deletion, TGC, also encoded a cysteine residue. Thus, the deletion resulted in the elimination of a single codon, 608, which encoded an arginine  residue. Detection of the R496L and AR608 mutations in patients with Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease has permitted genotype/phenotype correlations and provided insights into the function of the altered enzymes encoded by these mutant alleles (Table II). The homoallelic (R496L/R496L) Type A patient who expresses < 1 % of normal acid sphingomyelinase activity in cultured fibroblasts indicates that the R496L mutation encodes an acid sphingomyelinase polypeptide with little, if any, catalytic activity and/or markedly decreased stability, thereby resulting in the neuronopathic phenotype. In contrast, both heteroallelic (R496L/AR608) and homoallelic (AR608/ AR608) Type B patients express an enzyme with sufficient residual activity to prevent neurologic manifestations. These findings suggest that the substitution of an arginine for a leucine at position 496 was more damaging to the enzyme's activity and/ or stability than the deletion of an arginine residue in position 608. It follows that Type B patients who are homoallelic for AR608 would have a milder disease course than Type B patients who are heteroallelic for AR608 and a Type A mutation. Notably, proband 3 had comparatively milder disease manifestations than proband 2 at the same age. Thus, these genotype/ phenotype correlations indicate that the more residual acid sphingomyelinase activity expressed by the mutant alleles, the milder the disease manifestations. Ideally, in vitro expression would permit comparisons of the activity and stability of the residual enzymes expressed by each mutant acid sphingomyelinase allele. However, it is likely that the residual activities expressed by the mutant alleles would be too low to permit biochemical characterization, particularly since eukaryotic ex-  pression systems (e.g., COS-l cells, CHO cells) have endogenous acid sphingomyelinase activity and prokaryotic systems do not perform the posttranslational modifications (e.g., N-glycosylation) required for acid sphingomyelinase activity. The occurrence of genetic heterogeneity resulting in dramatically different phenotypes is a hallmark of the lysosomal storage diseases. A notable example in which the molecular lesions have been correlated with distinct phenotypes is TaySachs disease (26, 27). Mutations causing the classic, infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease have included deletions, insertions, and splice site mutations in the fl-hexosaminidase A a-chain gene that resulted in no detectable transcripts, whereas an exonic point mutation expresses sufficient enzymatic activity to result in the adult or chronic type of GM2 gangliosidosis. Analo-  gously, identification of the R496L and AR608 mutations has provided the first insights into the molecular lesions in the acid sphingomyelinase gene underlying the remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity in Niemann-Pick disease. Clearly, individuals who are homoallelic for the R496L mutation will have a severe neuronopathic phenotype and Type A Niemann-Pick disease. The phenotype of patients heteroallelic for R496L will depend on the genetic lesion present on their other acid sphingomyelinase allele. In contrast, patients who are either homo- or heteroallelic for the AR608 (e.g., probands 2 and 3) will most likely have Type B Niemann-Pick disease. The identification of additional mutations causing Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease should permit reliable genotype/phenotype correlations and provide further insights into the functional organization of the acid sphingomyelinase polypeptide.

"1","Tyrosinase gene mutations associated with type IB ("yellow") oculocutaneous albinism.We have identified three different tyrosinase gene mutant alleles in four unrelated patients with type IB ("yellow") oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) and thus have demonstrated that type IB OCA is allelic to type IA (tyrosinase negative) OCA. In an inbred Amish kindred, type IB OCA results from homozygosity for a Pro----Leu substitution at codon 406. In the second family, type IB OCA results from compound heterozygosity for a type IA OCA allele (codon 81 Pro----Leu) and a novel type IB allele (codon 275 Val----Phe). In the third patient, type IB OCA results from compound heterozygosity for the same type IB allele (codon 275 Val----Phe) and a novel type IB OCA allele. In a fourth patient, type IB OCA results from compound heterozygosity for the codon 81 type IA OCA allele and a type IB allele that contains no identifiable abnormalities; dysfunction of this type IB allele apparently results from a mutation either well within one of the large introns or at some distance from the tyrosinase gene. In vitro expression of the Amish type IB allele in nonpigmented HeLa cells demonstrates that the Pro----Leu substitution at codon 406 greatly reduces but does not abolish tyrosinase enzymatic activity, a finding consistent with the clinical phenotype.Am.

In an inbred Amish kindred, type IB OCA results from homozygosity for a Pro-'Qeu substitution at codon 406. In the second family, type IB OCA results from compound heterozygosity for a type IA OCA allele (codon 81 Pro-*Leu) and a novel type IB allele (codon 275 ValFPhe). In the third patient, type IB OCA results from compound heterozygosity for the same type IB allele (codon 275 Val-"Phe) and a novel type IB OCA allele. In a fourth patient, type IB OCA results from compound heterozygosity for the codon 81 type IA OCA allele and a type IB allele that contains no identifiable abnormalities; dysfunction of this type IB allele apparently results from a mutation either well within one of the large introns or at some distance from the tyrosinase gene. In vitro expression of the Amish type TB allele in nonpigmented HeLa cells demonstrates that the Pro-->Leu substitution at codon 406 greatly reduces but does not abolish tyrosinase enzymatic activity, a finding consistent with the clinical phenotype.  Introduction  Human oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive genetic disorders of pigmentation. Affected individuals are characterized by reduced or absent melanin synthesis in pigment cells of the skin, hair follicles, and eyes. Hypopigmentation of the retina is associated with decreased visual acuity, photophobia, and varying degrees of nystagmus (reviewed by King and Summers 1988; Witkop et al. 1989). Type I OCA results from deficient activity of melanocyte tyrosinase (E.C.1.14.18.1), the enzyme that catalyzes the first two steps in the melanin biosynthetic pathway: (1) the hydroxylation of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) and (2) the Received November 7, 1990; revision received January 29, 1991.

In classic, type IA (tyrosinasenegative) OCA, tyrosinase activity and melanin biosynthesis are entirely absent, whereas, in type IB OCA, tyrosinase activity and melanin production are greatly reduced. Type IB ("yellow") OCA was first described in an inbred Amish kindred (Nance et al. 1970) and was later identified in other populations. Patients with type IB OCA completely lack detectable pigment at birth and initially are indistinguishable from patients with classic, type IA OCA. However, patients with type IB OCA accumulate some melanin pigment, principally the yellow-red pheomelanins, during childhood and adulthood. The activity of hairbulb tyrosinase is greatly reduced in type IB OCA, and the existence of apparent type IA/IB OCA compound heterozygotes suggests that type IA and type IB OCA are allelic (Hu et al. 1980; Giebel et al. 1990). Cloning and sequence analysis of the human tyrosinase gene, located in chromosome segment 11ql4-->q21 (Barton et al. 1988), has permitted the recent identification of several different 1159  Giebel et al.  1160  tyrosinase gene mutations in patients with type I OCA (Tomita et al. 1989; Giebel et al. 1990, 1991b, and in press; Kikuchi et al. 1990; Spritz et al. 1990, 1991; Takeda et al. 1990). In the present paper we directly demonstrate that types IA and IB OCA are allelic and describe two novel missense mutations of the tyrosinase gene in four patients with type IB OCA. Furthermore, we show that the "Amish" type IB OCA mutation results in a >90% reduction in tyrosinase enzymatic activity in HeLa cells transfected with the mutant gene, as compared with that in cells transfected with the normal gene. This correlates well with the accumulation of a small amount of melanin pigment by individuals homozygous for this allele. Patients and Methods Patients Patient 1 (fig. 1A) was an adult Caucasian male, one of several members of an inbred Amish kindred with OCA type IB. This is the same kindred reported in the original description of type IB OCA (Nance et al. 1970); patient 1 is individual VII.9 in that report.  Note that considerable dark eumelanin pigment has accumulated in his scalp and facial hair over time. Patient 2 (fig. 1B) was an adult Caucasian female with typical features of OCA type IB. Detailed clinical descriptions and genetic analyses of her family have also been published previously (Hu et al. 1980; Giebel et al. 1990); patient 2 is patient 11 of family 1 in Giebel et al. (1990). Note that a moderate amount of yellow-red pheomelanin has accumulated in her scalp and facial hair over time. Patient 3 (fig. 1 C) was a 19-year-old Caucasian male with severe type IB OCA. There was very little detectable melanin pigment in his skin, hair, and eyes. His irides were pale blue and transilluminated completely, and his retinas had almost no detectable pigment. The visual acuity was greatly reduced, with foveal hypoplasia, constant nystagmus, and photophobia. A small amount of brown eumelanin pigment was evident in both his facial hair and the hair on his extremities. Patient 4 (fig. 1D) was a 15-year-old Caucasian male with typical type IB OCA. An extensive study of his very large family has been published (Giebel et al. 1990); patient 4 is patient IX of family 2 in that same report. Small to moderate amounts of both yellow pheomelanin and dark eumelanin pigment have accumulated in his scalp and facial hair over time. Quantitative assay of tyrosinase (tyrosine hydroxylase) in freshly epilated anagen hairbulbs (Kind and  Olds 1985) revealed no detectable activity, except for patient 3, in whom tyrosinase activity was 0.255 pmol tyrosine oxidized/120 min/hairbulb (normal range for blond individuals 1.50 ± 0.85; n = 13). Analysis of Genetic Linkage  DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of patient 1 and many members of his Amish kindred (fig. 2), was digested with TaqI, and was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization (Southern 1975) using cloned human tyrosinase cDNA as probe (Kwon et al. 1987). Autoradiograms were scored for polymorphic 2.8-kb versus 2.4-kb TaqI tyrosinase gene fragments (Spritz et al. 1988), and TaqI haplotypes were assigned to each individual. The OCA carrier status of all family members was defined by quantitative assay of tyrosinase (tyrosine hydroxylase) activity in anagen hairbulbs (King and Olds 1985). Linkage between the tyrosinase TaqI RFLP and type IB OCA was assessed by determination of logarithm-of-odds (lod) scores by using version 3 (1987) of the LIPED program (Ott 1974). Tyrosinase gene RFLP linkage analyses of the families of patients 2 and 4 have been published previously (Giebel et al. 1990). PCR and DNA Sequencing  DNA fragments corresponding to the five exons plus adjacent flanking regions of the human tyrosinase gene (Giebel et al. 1991a) were PCR amplified from 0.1-1.0 gg DNA of the four patients and were gel purified, cloned into bacteriophage vectors Ml3mpl 8 or mpl9, and sequenced, exactly as described elsewhere (Spritz et al. 1991).  Allele-specipc Oligonucleotide Hybridization Tyrosinase exon 2 gene fragments were PCR amplified from genomic DNA of OCA patients, their family members, and 30 unrelated normally pigmented individuals, exactly as described elsewhere (Spritz et al. 1991). Twenty microliters of each PCR reaction was transferred to MAGNA nylon membranes (Micron Separations) with a Bio-Dot SF microfiltration device (Bio-Rad). Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridizations of replicate filters were performed (Kogan and Gitschier 1990) by using 5'-radiolabeled 19-mer oligonucleotides corresponding to the normal (5'-ATTGTCTGTAGCCGATTGG-3') and mutant (5'-ATTTTCTGTAGCCGATTGG-3') - forms of codon 275.

Amplification products were digested with Mn1I and were analyzed by PAGE for the presence of the codon 406 mutation.  Site-directed Mutagenesis and In Vitro Expression of Cloned Tyrosinase cDNAs  The codon 406 CCT (Pro)--CTT (Leu) IB OCA mutation was introduced into the human tyrosinase cDNA expression plasmid pcTYR (Bouchard et al.  Giebel et al.  1162 A  2 .-4  111 __I_  112  1/2  1l/2  1/2 2/2  1/2  1/1  l/l  1/2 1/2  1/2  1/2l/  2/2 2/2  B  Pedigrees of two portions of Amish kindred with Figure 2 lB OCA.

A more complete pedigree of the extended kindred has been published by Nance et al. (1970). type  1989) according to a method described elsewhere (Giebel and Spritz 1990b). Exon 4 of the tyrosinase gene was PCR amplified from DNA (30 ng) of an M13 exon 4 clone containing the codon 406 mutation, by using 20-mer oligonucleotide primers (5'-TATTTTTGAGCAGTGGCTCC-3' and 5'-TAGCTATCTACAAGATTCAG-3'). PCR conditions were as described elsewhere (Giebel and Spritz 1990b), except that (a) only 25 cycles were performed and (b) the annealing step was two min. An exon 2-3-4 product was then amplified from 30 ng of tyrosinase cDNA by using as one primer 5 pmol gel-purified mutant exon 4 PCR product and as second primer a 20-mer oligonucleotide (5'-ATTGTCTGTAGCCGATTGGA-3') derived from the 5' end of exon 2. The resultant mutant exon 2-3-4 PCR product contained the codon 406 mutation and unique PvuII and BglII sites; these sites were used to replace the PvuII/BglII fragment of pcTYR by the corresponding codon 406 mutant fragment. The nucleotide sequence of the mutant expression plasmid pcTYR-T406 was verified by doublestranded DNA sequencing (Zhang et al. 1988). Expression of tyrosinase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was assayed by transient cotransfection of either pcTYR or pcTYR-T406 plus pSV2CAT into cultured HeLa cells by using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure (Gorman et al. 1982). Cells were harvested 64 h after transfection, were lysed in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.8, 0.5% Triton X-100, and were sonicated. After centrifugation the supernatant was dialyzed twice against 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. Fluorometric assay of cell extracts for tyrosinase (tyrosine hydroxylase) activity was done according to a method described elsewhere (Husain et al. 1982), except that  4 mM ascorbic acid was included as reductant for tyrosine hydroxylation (Tripathi et al. 1988) and to reduce any dopaquinone formed by tyrosinase back to dopa; thus, measurement of amount of dopa formed provides a true estimate of the tyrosine hydroxylase activity of tyrosinase. The 55-gl reactions containing 0.1 mM L-tyrosine, 5 gM L-dopa, 4 mM ascorbic acid, 40 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.8, and 15 Rl cell extract were incubated for 4 h. Production of dopa was measured by specific fluorescence at 360-nm excitation and 490-nm emission wavelengths. Protein concentrations of cell extracts were determined according to the method of Peterson (1977) and CAT activities were determined according to the method of Gorman et al. (1982). Results Type IB OCA Is Linked to the Tyrosinase Gene  TaqI digests were used to assign tyrosinase RFLP haplotypes to patient 1 and other members of the original Amish kindred with type IB OCA (fig. 2). Genetic linkage analysis of this family demonstrated linkage between OCA and the tyrosinase gene (lod score = 1.07, 0 = 0). Although part of this kindred was relatively uninformative (fig. 2B), the OCA IB trait cosegregated with the 2.8-kb polymorphic TaqI tyrosinase gene fragment; all individuals studied in the Amish kindred with homozygous type IB OCA were homozygous for the 2.8-kb TaqI fragment. We have previously published genetic linkage analyses of the families of patients 2 and 4 (Giebel et al. 1990) and have shown that in both families the type I OCA mutations are linked to the tyrosinase gene. Lod scores in these two families were 1.50 (8 = 0) and 6.17 (0 = 0), respectively. In both families individuals with type IB OCA were apparent compound heterozygotes for a type IB OCA allele and a frequent type IA OCA allele, containing a Pro--Leu substitution at codon 81 (Giebel et al. 1990). Patient I Is Homozygous for a Novel Missense Mutation at Codon 406  To identify mutations that cause type IB OCA, we PCR amplified each of the five exons of the tyrosinase gene plus adjacent noncoding sequences from genomic DNA of each of the four patients by using oligonucleotide primers derived from the normal tyrosinase gene sequence (Giebel et al. 1 991a). Amplification products were cloned in M13 vectors, and their DNA sequences were determined.  Tyrosinase Gene Mutations in Albinism Patient  1163 Patient ..G A T C  Normal  Normal (  A  T  I  -a  .-  G; A  T f  .3,  ITyr  TlVal  Glu ~ In  II Leu  406  j  Pro 406  eu  Le Ar Se  krg ;er  :ys  Cy  fal 275 Ile IVS1  275 Phi  EArg A  lIHis Arg  IVS1  GArg ILeu Normal  OCA  406 CTC CGA AGG CAC CGT CCT CTT CAA GAA GTT TAT Leu Arg Arg His Arg Pro Leu Gin Glu Val Tyr CTT Leu  Figure 3 Tyrosinase gene sequences in region of codon 406 mutation of patient 1. The sequences shown are those of the coding strand.  Analysis of the tyrosinase gene sequence of patient 1 revealed that he is homozygous for a novel missense substitution, CCT (Pro)--CTT (Leu), at codon 406 (fig. 3). No other abnormalities were found. At two nonpathological polymorphic sites within the tyrosinase-coding sequence, codon 192 TCT (Ser) versus TAT (Tyr) (Giebel and Spritz 1990a) and codon 402 CGA (Arg) versus CAA (Gln) (Tripathi et al., in press), patient 1 was homozygous, having TAT (Tyr) and CGA (Arg), respectively. Both of these polymorphisms are commonly found among normal individ-  uals. The codon 406 CCT--CTT substitution abolishes an MnlI restriction site, enabling us to easily test whether this substitution is a type IB OCA mutation or a nonpathologic polymorphism. Exon 4 tyrosinase gene fragments were amplified from genomic DNAs of all members of the Amish kindred shown in figure 2, were digested with Mn1I, and were analyzed by gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The distribution of the codon 406 substitution correlated perfectly with carrier status as determined by assay of tyrosinase enzymatic activity and RFLP data. All individuals with type IB OCA were homozygous for the codon 406 mutation; all OCA carriers were heterozygous for the codon 406 mutant allele; and all of the noncarriers had only the normal allele. We also analyzed the DNAs of 14 unrelated patients with type I OCA, including patients 2-4 of the present study; none had the codon  Normal OCA  IVS1 275 AATGTTTTGTACAG ATT GTC TGT AGC CGA TTG GAG Ile Val Cys Ser Arg Leu Glu TTC  Phe  Figure 4 Tyrosinase gene sequences in region of codon 275 mutation of patients 2 and 3.  406 mutant allele. We have also not detected the codon 406 substitution by DNA sequence analyses of 16 additional unrelated type IA OCA patients and two normal individuals. Therefore, the codon 406 substitution is not a common polymorphism but instead appears to be a private type IB OCA mutation in the Amish. Patients 2 and 3 are Compound Heterozygotes for a Novel Missense Substitution at Codon 275 and for Different Type IA OCA Mutations  The nucleotide sequence of tyrosinase gene fragments of patient 2 showed her to be a compound heterozygote for two different OCA alleles, each containing a different missense substitution. One allele, containing a CCT (Pro)--CTT (Leu) substitution at codon 81, is a relatively frequent type IA OCA allele (Giebel et al. 1990; authors' unpublished data). The patient's type IB OCA allele contains a novel substitution, GTC (Val)--TTC (Phe) at codon 275 (fig. 4). No other abnormalities were found. Patient 2 was homozygous for TCT (Ser) at polymorphic codon 192 and for CGA (Arg) at polymorphic codon 402. Tyrosinase gene DNA sequence analysis of patient 3 showed that he is also a compound heterozygote, for the same codon 275 Pro-*Leu type IB OCA mutant allele (fig. 4) and a novel allele, containing a frameshift (CGT--CCGT) at codon 501 (fig. 5). The frameshift  Giebel et al.  1164 Patient G  w  IB OCA allele (Giebel et al. 1990). Nucleotide sequence analysis of the tyrosinase genes of patient 4 confirmed this, demonstrating the codon 81 substitution in one of his two alleles. However, no abnormality could be identified in the other allele, including in the five exons, 39-87 bases of the adjacent intervening sequences, 693 bases of the 5' promoter region, and 388 bases of the 3' flanking region. These data suggest that the type IB OCA mutation in patient 4 may be either deep within one of the four large intervening sequences or at some distance from the tyrosinase gene. This apparent type IB OCA allele is associated with TAT (Tyr) at polymorphic codon 192 and with CAA (Gln) at polymorphic codon 402.

No other abnormalities were found. Patient 3 was homozygous for TCT (Ser) at polymorphic codon 192 and was heterozygous CGA (Arg)/CAA (Gln) at polymorphic codon 402. To determine whether the codon 275 tyrosinase gene substitution is causative of type IB OCA or is simply a nonpathologic polymorphism, we PCR amplified exon 2 gene fragments from DNA of patient 2, her entire family (see fig. 1 in Giebel et al. 1990), and 30 unrelated normal individuals. The exon 2 amplification products were then analyzed by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization (data not shown). The distribution of the codon 275 substitution correlated perfectly with tyrosinase enzymatic activity and RFLP data. All three individuals with type IB OCA in this family were compound heterozygotes for the codon 275 and codon 81 mutant alleles; all type IB OCA carriers were heterozygous for only the codon 275 mutant allele; and all of the noncarriers and the 30 unrelated normal individuals had only normal alleles.

The wildtype (pcTYR) and the mutant tyrosinase (pcTYRT406) expression plasmids were each transiently cotransfected along with pSV2CAT into cultured HeLa cells. The cells were harvested 64 h after transfection, and tyrosinase (tyrosine hydroxylase) activity, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity, and protein concentrations were determined (table 1). The CAT activity served as an internal control for transfection efficiency. As shown in table 1, the tyrosinase activity in HeLa cells transfected with the codon 406 Pro-*Leu mutant tyrosinase expression plasmid was only ".7% of the activity in cells transfected with the wild-type plasmid. It is interesting that, in general, the amount of pigment apparent in the four type IB OCA patients in the present study correlates only modestly well with their genotypes. Patient 1, who has the most apparent melanin pigment (fig. 1A), is homoallelic for type IB OCA, whereas patients 2-4, who all have considerably less melanin pigment (fig. 1B-D), are all type IA/IB compound heterozygotes. The pigmentation phenotype of type IB OCA is quite homogeneous within sibships (family 1 and family 2). However, there can be considerable phenotypic differences among unrelated type IB OCA patients, even among those with quite similar genotypes, and significant age-related accumulation of predominantly yellow-red pheomelanin is not a constant feature. In addition, the clinical phenotype among patients with type IB OCA does not correlate  1165  Tyrosinase Gene Mutations in Albinism Table I Activities of Normal and Codon 406 Pro- Leu Mutant Tyrosinases in Transfected HeLa Cells  Plasmida  pcTYR ................ pcTYR-T406  ...............

Patients 2 and 3 are both type IA/IB compound heterozygotes and share the same codon 275 Val- Phe type IB OCA allele (fig. 4). However, patient 2 (fig. 1B) has much more apparent pigment than does patient 3 (fig. 1C), who appears almost as severely hypopigmented as do patients with type IA OCA, despite having the highest hairbulb tyrosinase activity among the patients studied here, at the low end of the normal range. These differences of pigmentation phenotypes, along with poor correlation between clinical phenotype and measured tyrosinase enzymatic activity in type IB OCA, most likely result from epistatic phenomena acting on a background of low residual tyrosinase activity. By way of illustration, we note that the normally pigmented parents and sibs of patient 2 are very darkly complected, whereas those of patient 3 are very lightly complected; therefore, in the absence of OCA, patient 2 might otherwise have been darkly complected, whereas patient 3 might otherwise have been lightly complected. We have shown that the phenotypes of both type IA OCA and type IB OCA result from homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for a series of allelic mutations at the human tyrosinase locus. This will greatly enhance genetic counseling for the various forms of type I OCA. The occurrence of the codon 275 mutant allele in both proband 2 and proband 3, who are unrelated, suggests that this may be a frequent allele in patients with type IB OCA. Furthermore, the availability of carrier detection for the Amish codon 406  mutant allele offers obvious advantages for genetic counseling of this high-risk population. Discussion  Type IB OCA was first described by Nance et al. (1970) in an inbred Amish kindred. Tyrosinase enzymatic activity is decreased or undetectable, respectively, in type IB OCA and type IA OCA, and the observation of families with apparent type IA/ IB OCA compound heterozygotes strongly suggested that these two forms of OCA are allelic (Hu et al. 1980; Giebel et al. 1990). Recent advances in recombinant-DNA technology made it possible to investigate the molecular relationship between type IA OCA and type IB OCA. In the present study we have considered four unrelated patients with type IB OCA, including one of the original inbred Amish kindred described by Nance et al. (1970). Tyrosinase gene RFLP linkage analyses were consistent with allelism of types IA and IB OCA. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the tyrosinase genes of patient 1, the Amish patient, demonstrated that he is homozygous for a novel Pro Leu substitution at codon 406 (fig. 3). Patient 2 was a compound heterozygote for a previously published (Giebel et al. 1990) type IA OCA allele, i.e., codon 81 Pro- Leu, and a novel allele containing a type IB OCA substitution, i.e., codon 275 Val-)Phe (fig. 4). Patient 3 was a compound heterozygote for the same codon 275 Val Phe type IB OCA allele and a novel type IA OCA allele, containing a frameshift at codon 501. Patient 4 was also apparently a compound heterozygote, for the codon 81 Pro--Leu type IA OCA allele and a tyrosinase allele in which we detected no abnormality. It is likely that this allele contains a mutation either well within one of the four large intervening sequences or at some distance from the tyrosinase structural gene. Thus, at least three different tyrosinase alleles can be associated with type IB OCA. We tested the effect that the Amish codon 406 ProLeu substitution had on tyrosinase enzymatic activity, by expressing a tyrosinase cDNA containing this mutation in HeLa cells. We found that the codon 406 substitution greatly decreases, but does not abolish, tyrosinase activity in vitro, a finding consistent with the "leaky" in vivo phenotype of type IB OCA in patients homozygous for this mutant allele. It is interesting that, in general, the amount of pigment apparent in the four type IB OCA patients in the present study correlates only modestly well with their genotypes. Patient 1, who has the most apparent mela-  1166  nin pigment (fig. 1A), is homoallelic for type TB OCA, whereas patients 2-4, who all have considerably less melanin pigment (fig. 1B-D), are all type IA/1B compound heterozygotes. The pigmentation phenotype of type IB OCA is quite homogeneous within sibships (family 1 and family 2). However, there can be considerable phenotypic differences among unrelated type IB OCA patients, even among those with quite similar genotypes, and significant age-related accumulation of predominantly yellow-red pheomelanin is not a constant feature. In addition, the clinical phenotype among patients with type IB OCA does not correlate well with measured levels of hairbulb tyrosinase activity, the assay for which is unreliable toward the low end of its range. Patients 2 and 3 are both type IA/IB compound heterozygotes and share the same codon 275 Val--Phe type IB OCA allele (fig. 4). However, patient 2 (fig. 1B) has much more apparent pigment than does patient 3 (fig. 1C), who appears almost as severely hypopigmented as do patients with type IA OCA, despite having the highest hairbulb tyrosinase activity among the patients studied here, at the low end of the normal range. These differences of pigmentation phenotypes, along with poor correlation between clinical phenotype and measured tyrosinase enzymatic activity in type IB OCA, most likely result from epistatic phenomena acting on a background of low residual tyrosinase activity. By way of illustration, we note that the normally pigmented parents and sibs of patient 2 are very darkly complected, whereas those of patient 3 are very lightly complected; therefore, in the absence of OCA, patient 2 might otherwise have been darkly complected, whereas patient 3 might otherwise have been lightly complected. We have shown that the phenotypes of both type IA OCA and type IB OCA result from homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for a series of allelic mutations at the human tyrosinase locus. This will greatly enhance genetic counseling for the various forms of type I OCA. The occurrence of the codon 275 mutant allele in both proband 2 and proband 3, who are unrelated, suggests that this may be a frequent allele in patients with type IB OCA. Furthermore, the availability of carrier detection for the Amish codon 406 mutant allele offers obvious advantages for genetic counseling of this high-risk population.

"1","Alzheimer's disease is a form of localized amyloidosis characterized by cerebral cortical amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and amyloid deposits within the walls of leptomeningeal vessels. Although most cases of Alzheimer's disease are sporadic, kindreds with autosomal-dominant inheritance of the syndrome suggest that a single mutation may be important in pathogenesis. Direct sequencing of DNA from a family with autopsy-proven Alzheimer's disease revealed a single amino acid substitution (Phe for Val) in the transmembrane domain of the amyloid precursor protein.

The initiating methionine in pBSATG corresponds to the initiating methionine of the cDNAs. There are no amino acids derived from the pBS-ATG vector in the coding sequences. We constructed the plasmids pSV2A-mTFE3-S and pSV2A-mTFE3-L by insertion of the Hind III-Eco RI fragment from the pBS-ATG-cDNA vectors that contained the entirety of the cDNA (2.1 kb) and inserted them into pSV2A (1, 11) that had been linearized with Bam HI and Hind III and end-filled. These vectors drive transcription of the cDNA by the SV40 enhancer and early promoter. 13. C. Roman and K. Calame, unpublished data. 14. Y. Nakabeppu and D. Nathans, Cell 64, 751 (1991); J.

Patients with hereditary Alzheimer's disease typically develop three pathologic lesions: (i) senile plaques in the cerebral cortex characterized by a central amyloid core surrounded by dystrophic neurites; (ii) neurofibrillary tangles; and (iii) congophilic angiopathy of the leptomeningeal vessels. The amyloid deposits in the senile plaques and in the blood vessel walls contain a fibril subunit protein of 39 to 43 amino acid residues (1), which is a portion of the carboxyl terminus of the amyloid precursor protein (APP).

Although the sequence of the APP gene from some patients with either sporadic or familial Alzheimer's disease is normal (6-8), a missense mutation in the membrane-spanning domain of the APP gene has been identified in patients from several families with familial Alzheimer's disease (9, 10). We used genomic DNA from three generations of a family with classic early-onset autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease to determine whether the disease in this family is associated with a point mutation in the APP gene. We amplified and sequenced exon 15 of the APP gene using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Fig. 1) (7, 9, 11).

This mutation is consistent with observations of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP), in which multiple single amino acid substitutions are associated with amyloid fibril formation (15). Although the pathogenesis of disease in systemic amyloidosis is generally considered to involve the formation of amyloid deposits that lead to destruction of normal tissue, similar conclusions cannot yet be drawn for hereditary Alzheimer's disease. The dementia may be in part the result of altered function of the variant APP protein and not the direct result of displacement of normal tissue by amyloid fibrils. This amino acid substitution (Val to Phe) is at the same position in APP as the Val to Ile substitution found by Goate et al. in another family with early-onset hereditary Alzheimer's disease (9). This position is two residues beyond the carboxyl terminus of the 1-amyloid peptide subunit isolated from fibrils. Because the carboxyl terminus of the ,B-amyloid peptide is heterogeneous and the amyloid protein from neither of the families found to have mutations at position 1924 has been studied, this amino acid may be included in the amyloid subunit protein in these particular kindreds. In any case, this position in the APP molecule must be important both in the generation of amyloid fibril deposits and Alzheimer's disease. Single amino acid substitutions are also found in other forms of hereditary amyloidosis. In the transthyretin amyloidoses (FAP, types I and II), a number of single amino acid substitutions in transthyretin are SCIENCE, VOL. 254  Downloaded from www.sciencemag.org on February 1, 2011  9  VII  Natvig et al., Eds.

TODD, III, STEPHEN J. WEISS* Movement of neutrophils from the bloodstream to inflamed tissue depends on the activation of both the neutrophil and the endothelial cell. Endothelial cells lining the postcapillary venule respond to proinflammatory mediators by expressing adhesion molecules and synthesizing a variety of neutrophil-activating factors. Endothelial cell production of a 77-amino acid variant of interleukin-8 (IL-8) was found to be a requirement for the invasion of neutrophils through a vessel wall model. IL-8 secreted by cytokine- or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated endothelial cells induced the rapid shed-  ding of neutrophil lectin adhesion molecule-i, the up-regulation of leukocyte 02 integrins, and the attachment and transmigration of the neutrophils. Thus, endogenous endothelial IL-8 regulates transvenular traffic during acute inflammatory responses. N  REFERENCES AND NOTES  1. G. G. Glenner and C. W. Wong, Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This initial adhesive interaction is regulated by a member of the lectin-cellular adhesion molecule family (lectin adhesion molecule-l; LECAM-1) that is displayed on the surface of unstimulated neutrophils (1, 2). Binding of the neutrophils to the inflamed endothelium then initiates an orchestrated series of events in which the neutrophils shed LECAM-1 and engage a second set of adhesion-promoting glycoproteins, the leukocyte P2 integrins (1, 2). The adherent neutrophils then penetrate the vessel wall by moving between interendothelial-cell junctions and proceeding through the underlying basement membrane into the interstitium (1-3). The initial interaction between LECAM-1 on the circulating neutrophil and the surface of stimulated endothelial cells is presumed to be a passive event (1, 2).

We now show, in a model of the postcapillary venular wall (3), that IL-1I3-, TNFa-, or LPS-stimulated endothelial cells actively promote neutrophil transvenular migration by the synthesis and release of a 77-amino acid variant of interleukin-8 (IL-877) (4). Although endothelial IL-877 is thought to be a specific inhibitor of neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions (5), we show that this molecule is a primary promoter of neutrophil diapedesis by virtue of its ability to both regulate LECAM-1 and I2 integrin expression and to form a transendothelial cell chemotactic gradient. To duplicate the conditions under which endothelial cells promote transvenular neutrophil migration in vivo, we added IL-11, TNFa, or LPS to the basilar compartment of the blood vessel wall construct, and after a 4-hour incubation, 1 x 106 neutrophils were added in fresh media to the apical compartment, and invasion was monitored. Under these conditions, 79 + 7%, 81 -- 6%, and 85 _ 8% (± SEM, n = 4) of the added neutrophils were associated with IL-113-, INFa-, and LPS-stimulated vessel wall constructs, whereas only 9 ± 3% were associated with untreated, control cultures (6).

Similarly, FAP type HI is associated with amyloid deposits that contain a peptide of apolipoprotein Al with a single amino acid substitution (Gly to Arg) (12). In Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSS), a hereditary adult-onset dementia with cerebral amyloid plaques composed of a fragment of the prion protein, every GSS family studied to date has a mutation in the gene coding for this protein (16-18). Hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis in Icelandic kindreds (HCHWA-I) is associated with a single amino acid substitution in cystatin C (19), and a similar syndrome in Dutch kindreds (HCHWA-D) is associated with a single amino acid substitution of Gln for Glu in APP (20). Although other single amino acid substitutions in APP may be associated with amyloid deposits and Alzheimer's disease, it is unlikely that single amino acid substitutions in APP can explain all sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease. Recently it has been proposed that in some cases of FAP, normal transthyretin may form amyloid deposits in association with unknown aging factors (21). Similarly, in Alzheimers disease, different pathogenic processes may lead to a common clinical presentation.  "

Making an accurate diagnosis can be particularly difficult in children, who may not have cardiac hypertrophy until adulthood. Recently, we demonstrated that mutations in the cardiac myosin heavy-chain genes cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in some families. We report a diagnostic test for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that relies on the detection of mutations in the beta myosin heavy-chain gene in circulating lymphocytes that we used to evaluate three generations of a family, including the children. METHODS AND RESULTS Using the polymerase chain reaction, we found that normal and mutant beta cardiac myosin heavy-chain genes are transcribed in circulating lymphocytes. This allowed us to examine beta cardiac myosin heavy-chain messenger RNA from blood lymphocytes, even though ordinary expression of the gene is virtually restricted to the heart. Base sequences amplified from this messenger RNA were analyzed with a ribonuclease protection assay to identify small deletions, abnormal splicing, or missense mutations. Using this technique we identified a novel missense mutation in a patient with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We evaluated 15 of the patient's adult relatives and found perfect agreement with the clinical diagnosis (8 affected and 7 not affected). Clinical analysis of 14 of the children (age, 1 to 20 years) of these affected family members revealed 1 child with echocardiographic findings diagnostic of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, genetic analyses showed that six other children had also inherited the missense mutation and might later manifest the disease. CONCLUSIONS Transcripts of beta cardiac myosin heavy-chain gene can be detected in blood lymphocytes and used to screen for mutations that cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This approach makes practical the identification of mutations responsible for this disorder and may be applicable to other diseases in which direct analysis is difficult because the mutated gene is expressed only in certain tissues. Preclinical or prenatal screening in an affected family will make it possible to study the disease longitudinally and to develop preventive interventions. "
"1","Segregation analyses were performed for plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in five Christian Arab kindreds identified through probands with familial hypercholesterolemia. In this subset of the Christian Arab community, the results were consistent with major gene determination of LDL-C with allele frequency (q) of 0.042 (95% confidence interval 0.008-0.079) in addition to polygenic transmission (h2 = 0.34). The "Lebanese" allele was identified directly by polymerase chain reaction and HinfI restriction analysis.

Segregation analyses were performed for plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) in five Christian Arab kindreds identified through probands with familial hypercholesterolemia. In this subset of the Christian Arab community, the results were consistent with major gene determination of LDL-C with allele frequency (q) of 0.042 (95% confidence interval 0.008-0.079) in addition to polygenic transmission (h 2 = 0.34). The "Lebanese" allele was identified directly by polymerase chain reaction and H i n f I restriction analysis. Analysis of this mutation permits direct diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia in most affected individuals although our results indicated the possible existence of an additional independent factor leading to elevated LDLC levels. The segregation results for TG indicated the presence of a major effect, although the existence of a major gene could not be demonstrated. There was also no evidence of a major locus effect on HDL-C levels.  Introduction Previous clinical and epidemiological studies have recognized plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels as important risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD; Tyroler 1987). High levels of total plasma cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and trigylcerides (TG) and low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with increased risk of CHD. Strong familial aggregation of these traits has been established in many studies (Garrison et al. 1979; Robertson 1981; Friedlander et al. 1982; Namboodiri et al. 1984). Examination of the relevant factors determining familial resemblance has indicated that a multifactorial component governed by many genetic loci, as well Offprint requests to: E. Leitersdorf  as by environmental factors, is one source of trait variability. The presence of rare major genes with large effect strongly influences the variation of some of these traits. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant disease characterized by raised plasma LDL-C levels, is caused by mutations in the LDL-receptor gene (Brown and Goldstein 1986). The effects of a host of mutations in this gene on plasma LDL-C levels have been clearly delineated in recent years (Hobbs et al. 1990). The estimated world prevalence of heterozygous FH is 1 in 500 persons. However, in several population groups the disease is much more common (Khachadurian and Uthman 1973; Seftel et al. 1980; Moorjani et al. 1989). In these population groups most FH subjects living in the same area have the same LDL receptor mutation (Lehrman et al. 1987; Hobbs et al. 1987; Leitersdorf et al. 1989b, 1990), presumably as a result of a founder effect. Khachadurian and Uthman (1973) observed an increased prevalence of F H in Lebanon. A single mutation in the LDL-receptor gene (a nucleotide substitution that produces a premature termination codon and a truncated receptor) was subsequently found to be responsible for FH in most of the Lebanese homozygous cases (Lehrman et al. 1987). The possible existence of other mutations responsible for elevated LDL-C levels in this community was also suggested (Lehrman et al. 1987). The adult Christian Arab population living in the Galilee region of northern Israel consists mainly of Lebanese who have immigrated from Lebanon over the last two centuries. In recent years, several individuals from this community have been identified as FH patients. Ascertainment of all available family members of kindreds sampled from this Israeli-Arab community to determine carrier status of the "Lebanese" mutation offers the opportunity to test the validity of methods of segregation analysis for inferring major genes. In addition it allows an estimation of the rote of environmental and polygenic factors in the variability in the FH phenotype.  76  Segregation and linkage analysis  Materials and methods  Family ascertainment Five Christian Arab kindreds (7 to 37 individuals in each) were recruited to the study through probands treated at the Lipid Clinic of the Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem for hypercholesterolemia and xanthomatosis. The five probands had LDL-C levels ranging from 188 to 666. Pedigrees were constructed and birth dates verified through personal interviews with all available family members and official identification documents. Each pedigree consisted of at least three generations.  Lipid determination Fasting blood samples were drawn for determination of total plasma cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Measurements were performed using commercially available kits (Boehringer Mannheim). LDL-C was estimated according to the Friedewald formula (Friedewald et al. 1972).  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the Lebanese allele Genomic DNA was extracted from blood leukocytes as described (Hobbs et al. 1986) and was amplified using the PCR technique (Saiki et al. 1988) applied as described (Leitersdorf et al. 1989a). Oligonucleotides LM-I (5'-GAGTGAACTGGTGTGAGAGGACCAC3') and LM-II (5'-CTGTGAGGCAGCTCCTCATGTCCCT-3') complementary to exon 14 sequences that flank the mutation were used. The amplified DNA was subjected to restriction analysis using HinfI enzyme (New England Biolabs, Beverly Mass.) and electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Results were read directly from gels following ethidium bromide staining.  Data transformation  The mixed model of segregation analysis (Morton and MacLean 1974; Lalouel et al. 1983) was used to test for the presence of major loci. This model incorporates the following independent sources of variation: a major locus with a large effect; polygenes, each with a small effect; and a random nontransmissible factor. The polygenic and the random environment are assumed to be normally distributed and the major locus is assumed to have two alleles (A and a). The model involves estimating the following parameters: q, frequency of the major locus allele (a) for extreme levels of the trait. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the relative frequency of individuals with genotypes AA, Aa and aa is p2, 2pq and q2 respectively, where p = 1 - q. Other parameters of the model include ~AA, ~Aa and ~aa as the phenotypic means and the phenotypic variance r among subjects having the same major gene genotype (AA, Aa or aa). The mixed model partitions this variance into a fraction attributable to polygenes (h z) and the rest ( 1 - h 2) attributable to individual environmental effects. Dominance of an allele occurs when ~Aa = ~AA or ~Aa = ~aa, whereas the general Mendelian hypothesis allows ~AA ~: OAa "aa. In addition three transmission probabilities (~1, z2, x3) that persons of the three types (AA, Aa, and aa) will transmit A to their offspring is included in the model (Elston and Stewart 1971). Under Mendelian hypothesis in which types are genotypes, zl, x2, T3take on values 1, 0.5 and 0, respectively. Likelihood of various genetic models were computed using pedigree analysis package (PAP; Hasstedt and Cartwright 1981) and the maximum likelihood parameter estimates were obtained with GEMINI (Lalouel 1979). For the mixed model, an approximation of the exact likelihood was employed. Different subhypotheses were tested with a likelihood ratio criterion by fixing certain parameters to their hypothesized values while estimating the remaining parameters from the data. Minus twice the natural logarithm of the ratio of the maximum likelihood in the full model, to the maximum likelihood in the reduced model, is distributed approximately x 2 when the null hypothesis is true. The degrees of freedom equal the number of parameters restricted to values stated by the hypothesis. The test of hypotheses done during segregation analysis were: 1. No familial transmission (no major locus or polygenic loci effect).  The effects of sex and age on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations were investigated. Since familial data was ascertained through nonrandomly recruited probands, the phenotypes in the sample were adjusted following the method proposed by Morton (1979). First, all probands were removed from the sample used to derive regression equations. Then, using the multiple regression analysis, we modeled each lipid and llpoprotein as a function of the following variables: sex, age, age 2, age 3, sex • age, sex x age z, sex • age 3, and REL x PHPROB, where REL is the coefficient of relationship of the individual to the proband and PHPROB is the phenotype level of the proband. Only significant terms were retained. All values were then adjusted to the mean age of men and the adjusted data were further standardized with their own mean and standard deviation. Skewness in the distribution of quantitative trait can falsely simulate a major locus unless adequately transformed prior to segregation analysis. Therefore, we applied the method of MacLean et al. (1976) to distinguish between skewness and the possibility of comingling. Specifically, the data were transformed as:  2. No major gene transmission (polygenic model). 3. No polygenic effect (codominant major locus model, dominant major locus model, or recessive major locus model). To confirm the presence of a major locus, the likelihood of the submodels assuming Mendelian transmission were compared with the likelihood of the general model with estimated transmission probabilities. To eliminate an environmental mixture of distributions, we also tested the hypothesis that Xl = x2 = x3 = x by comparing the likelihood of the mixed model with estimated transmission probabilities. A major locus was inferred if environmentaltransmission was rejected, while Mendelian inheritance could not be rejected. We corrected for ascertainment by calculating the likelihood of the pedigrees conditional on the phenotypes of the probands (Cannings and Thompson 1977). Maximum likelihood methods were also computed using the PAP program to test the linkage between the HinfI site at the LDL receptor gene and the possible major gene for each of the lipids and lipoproteins (Morton 1955).  Results  y = for ~,=0 where we used R = 6 as a scale constant to ensure that x/R is positive. Different estimates of power transformation were obtained under the assumption of a single normal distribution and a mixture of two and three normal distributions.

Following HinfI restriction analysis the amplified DNA was size fractionated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed for 6 h. HaelII-digested ~x size marker was used. The 153-bp band signifies the normal allele and the 98-bp band, the mutant allele following HinfI digestion. The results obtained for a nuclear family within kindred FH r 300 are shown. The grandmother (III-14) and both parents (IV-18 and IV-19) are clinically heterozygous (all three have hypercholesterolemia and tendon xanthomas). The two children (V-1 and V-2) are homozygous FH patients with diffused xanthomatosis and extremely elevated LDL cholesterol levels (Appendix I). The genotype obtained by restriction analysis of their amplified DNA correlates well with their observed phenotypes different models from the segregation analysis of the L D L - C data was calculated within the different pedigrees. Table 5 presents twice the difference in natural log likelihoods under the different genetic models and indicates that four pedigrees supported a single m a j o r gene. The detection of the " L e b a n e s e " mutation in the L D L - r e c e p t o r gene w~is determined with the restriction Table 6. Genotype distribution and allele frequency of the Lebanese a allele (H2) detected with the restriction endonuclease HinfI in 112 family members of the index  enzyme H i n f I on PCR-amplified D N A (Fig. 1). The frequency of the mutant alleles d e t e r m i n e d in 112 family m e m b e r s is given in Table 6. T h e frequency of the rare ( " L e b a n e s e " ) allele H 2 was a p p r o x i m a t e l y 20%. Results f r o m linkage analysis for L D L - C using maxim u m likelihood m e t h o d showed the largest lod score (21.3) at a recombination fraction | = 0, confirming a cosegregation of the mutation and the m a j o r gene for the L D L - C phenotype. A h e t e r o g e n e i t y test (Ott 1983) indicated homogeneity in lod scores at | = 0 across the five pedigrees. H o w e v e r , it is i m p o r t a n t to note that in two pedigrees (FH354. FH362), lod score values were less than 3.0.  Discussion O n e of the main predisposing factors to coronary heart disease is hyperlipidemia especially an elevated level of LDL-C. In the general population probably several genes are involved in the d e v e l o p m e n t of hyperlipidemia. The L D L - r e c e p t o r gene is the best u n d e r s t o o d (Brown and Goldstein 1986). H o b b s et al. (1990) have shown that m a n y different mutations in the L D L - r e c e p t o r gene can cause familial hypercholesterolemia. O u r data strongly support the hypothesis that the " L e b a n e s e " allele, an L D L - r e c e p t o r mutation, accounts for extremely elevated LDL-cholesterol levels a m o n g m e m b e r s of large A r a b kindreds living in the Galilee region of northern Israel. T h e small n u m b e r of families in the study reduces the possibility of genetic heterogeneity. O t h e r studies based on restriction f r a g m e n t length p o l y m o r p h i s m ( R F L P ) analysis showed tight linkage b e t w e e n single L D L - r e -  Allele frequency  Genotype frequency H1H1  H1H2  H2H2  H1  H2  cases  Males Females  28 41  29.3 43.1  19 23  16.4 18.9  1 0  2.3 2.1  0.781 _ 0.042 0.820 __.0.034  0.219 + 0.042 0.180 • 0.043  Total  69  72.3  42  35.4  1  4.3  0.804 • 0.027  0.196 __.0.027  a All five probands (two males, three females) including one horn| heterozygotes are not included in this table  FH and four  80 ceptor sites and the major gene for hypercholesterolemia (Humphries et al. 1985; Leppert et al. 1986). In several population groups, single mutations in the LDL-receptor gene were found in most of the familial hypercholesterolemic subjects (Hobbs et al. 1987; Leitersdoff et al. 1989b, 1990; Aalto-Setala et al. 1989). In the present study, the linkage between the major gene for plasma LDL-C and the existence of the "Lebanese" mutation combining all five pedigrees was proven. In two pedigrees, (FH354 and FH362) the maximum lod scores at | = 0 was less than 3.0. In pedigree FH362 it seems that the lower lod score is due to decreased informativeness resulting from the small number of individuals investigated. In several nuclear families in pedigree FH354, it appears that there may be a second major factor resulting in the elevated LDL-C levels. In these families, a number of individuals were observed with LDL-C levels between 182 mg/dl (III-24) and 219 mg/dl (IV-14) although they did not carry the "Lebanese allele." One of these individuals (IV-14) was found to have xanthomatosis and corneal arcus. Haplotype analysis at the LDL-receptor gene locus (through study of the joint segregation of ten RFLPs according to Leitersdorf 1989a) was done for his nuclear family as well as for an F H homozygote that carries the "Lebanese" allele. This patient has LDLreceptor haplotypes 2, 3, and the FH homozygote was haplotypes 23,23. These results support the conclusion that an additional mutation is probably responsible for FH in some individuals from our sample. This possible heterogeneity was also indicated in our preliminary segregation analysis (Table 5). Our parameters estimated from the mixed model suggested that the inheritance of LDL-C in this subpopulation involves both a codominant major gene and a polygenic component. Support for the involvement of a single major gene was expressed in four pedigrees, while the fifth pedigree (FH354) supports additional effects on plasma LDL-C. The possibility of the involvement of a second distinct mutation in the LDLreceptor has been previously suggested in several FH cases from the Lebanese population (Lehrman et al. 1987). Thus, it is possible that in the present study population, which is believed to be descended from the Lebanese, the same rare mutation exists in addition to the relatively common "Lebanese" mutation. According to parameters estimated in the segregation analysis (following ascertainment correction) approximately 8% of the individuals of this subcommunity of Christian Arabs (ascertained through the Lipid Clinic) are expected to be heterozygous for the "Lebanese" mutation. This number should be judged with caution however, due to the relatively high standard error (0.02). The prevalence of heterozygotes may thus range from 1.6% to 14.5% (95% confidence interval). The minimal expected prevalence (1:62.5) is similar to that found in the Afrikaner population (Seftel et al. 1980), which in both cases is much higher than the average worldwide frequency of 1:500 (Hobbs et al. 1990). A similar high prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia has been reported in other populations (Khachadurian et al. 1973; Seftel et al. 1980). The reason for the high prevalence of FH in this specific ethnic group is not known, but it is  probably related, as in other populations, to a founder effect. The results in our sample provide evidence that 34.4% of the LDL-C variance around the LDL-receptor genotypic means may be attributed to a polygenic effect. From the segregation analysis, which ignores the measured genotypic information, it appears that in this subcommunity (as defined by our clinic) the major gene contribution to the total LDL-C variability is greater (30.4%) than that of the polygenic variance component (23.2%). In the general population, due to low prevalence of F H the contribution of the polygenic component is higher and the variability at the LDL-receptor locus accounts for about 1% of cholesterol variability (Sing et al. 1975). From a practical viewpoint, the present linkage data indicate that the diagnosis of FH using the PCR technique on genomic DNA in Christian Arabs living in Israel is feasible. Examining their PCR-amplified D N A with the HinfI restriction endonuclease, should provide early diagnosis in the great majority of individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia. This method can also be applied to prenatal diagnosis. In addition, our analysis indicates the validity of segregation analysis in pedigrees with a known LDL-receptor mutation. This allows estimation of other components of the LDL-C variability (major genes and environmental parameters), which may have therapeutic implications. Previous studies disagree as to whether triglyceride levels are subject to major gene effects or are transmitted through multifactorial mechanisms. The known heterogeneity of hypertriglyceridemia may cause incosistencies regarding the mode of inheritance. Elevated plasma triglyceride levels can be due to familial hypertriglyceridemia (type-IV hyperlipidemia), familial combined hyperlipidemia (type IIB), remnant hyperlipidemia (type III) or type-V hyperlipoproteinemia. In addition, polygenic and sporadic hypertriglyceridemia are also known. Some authors have suggested that the mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant with increased penetration in adults and the gene frequency has been estimated to be 0.005 (Goldstein and Brown 1989). When complex segregation was applied to samples of pedigrees and nuclear families, there was no statistical evidence for a major gene in any of these studies (Morton et al. 1978; Williams et al. 1982). On the basis of complex analysis, our results support a major effect. Yet, the likelihood for a Mendelian gene was lower than for a major environmental effect. The high levels of triglycerides in the five families may be due to diverse etiologies. These observations may obscure a major gene involvement. A further complication is that ascertainment was based on LDL-C and not triglycerides. Methods for constructing the likelihood for data ascertainment in this way have been described (Dawson and Elston 1984) but were not yet incorporated into the currently available computer software. In the noncarriers, the correlation coefficients between LDL-C and TG, LDL-C and HDL-C, and TG and HDL-C were 0.24, -0.09, -0.59, respectively. As the correlation between LDL-C and triglyceride is modest, it may not be critical to use ascertainment correction, and thus the estimate of  81 the transmission probabilities u n d e r the unified m o d e l m a y in part reflect the inappropriate ascertainment correction. L o w levels o f H D L - C are also of clinical i m p o r t a n c e b e c a u s e of the well-established inverse relationship between these levels and c o r o n a r y heart disease (Castelli et al. 1977; G o l d b o u r t 1979). Several genetic disorders related to extreme levels o f H D L - C have b e e n described ( H a v e l et al. 1980; Franceschini et al. 1980; G l o m s e t et al. 1983). O u r lack o f evidence for a single locus with a major effect o n H D L - C levels in these five pedigrees, eliminates in our analysis these k n o w n genetic disorders. T h e present analysis indicates that a m o d e s t a m o u n t of triglyceride and H D L - C variability was due to polygenic effect. It is the goal o f the m e a s u r e d g e n o t y p e a p p r o a c h to partition this polygenic contribution into the contribution o f individual m e a s u r e d loci. T h e clustering o f the apolipoprotein A I - C I I I - A I V genes o n c h r o m o s o m e 11 as well as the clustering o f apolipoprotein C I - C I I and E on c h r o m o s o m e 19 suggest that R F L P s in these gene clusters could be associated with triglyceride and H D L - C levels (Karathanasis et al. 1983; Rees et al. 1983). It would be of interest to d e t e r m i n e these p o l y m o r p h i s m s in highrisk families to e x a m i n e their effects o n triglyceride and H D L - C concentrations. I n particular, it would be important to examine the possible effect of interactions between the L D L - r e c e p t o r locus and the other genes on the p h e n o t y p i c expressions o f lipid and lipoprotein levels.

Molecular analysis of aldolase B genes in hereditary fructose intolerance  molecular basis of hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) was studied in 50 subjects (41 pedigrees, 82 apparently independent mutant alleles of aldolase B) by direct analysis of aldolase B genes amplified by means of the polymerase chain reaction. The mutation A149P (ala 149&rarr; pro) was found in 67% of alleles but was significantly more common in patients from northern than from southern Europe. Two other point mutations of aldolase B were identified. A174D (C&rarr;A; ala 174&rarr; asp) was found in subjects from Italy, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia (overall frequency 16%) but not in those from the United Kingdom, France, or the United States. L288&Dgr;C carried a single base-pair deletion causing frameshift at codon 288 and was restricted to Sicilian subjects. By testing for these mutations in amplified DNA with a limited panel of allele-specific oligonucleotides, more than 95% of HFI patients will be susceptible to genetic diagnosis.  The  Introduction fructose intolerance (HFI) is an autosomal recessive disease that results from a deficiency of aldolase B (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, EC 4.1.2.13) in the liver, kidney, and intestine; this enzyme brings about the assimilation of fructose by means of cleavage of fructose-1phosphate to trioses.1-3 Affected people suffer from abdominal pain, vomiting, and hypoglycaemia after ingestion of fructose or related sugars and are most at risk from severe metabolic disturbance as infants at weaning. Nonetheless, episodic hypoglycaemia, liver disease, renal tubular acidosis, and growth retardation follow exposure to fructose in later life, occasionally with fatal results.3-6 The  Hereditary  disorder is treated by strict dietary exclusion of fructose, sorbitol, and sucrose, and the response is usually complete. In undiagnosed patients a strong aversion to sweet-tasting foods develops, with a consequent reduction of fructose intake, but in the absence of professional advice, complete elimination of this sugar from the diet is difficult, and such people may suffer symptoms throughout life.1,3,6 Prompt recognition of the disease is therefore important for its effective management. The diagnosis of HFI is confirmed by the intravenous fructose tolerance test or by direct assay of fructaldolase activities in tissue biopsy samples.’ These procedures are invasive and are especially difficult in infants and young children. Detection of disease carriers poses particular difficulties, and although heterozygotes have been identified by enzymic assay of intestinal mucosa8 and by phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy after fructose loading,9 until now no simple and direct procedure has been available. We have described the isolation and characterisation of a defective aldolase B gene from a patient with HFI/" We identified a single base-pair change which results in the replacement of an alanine residue at position 149 by a proline ADDRESSES: Departments of Haematology and Medicine, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK (N.

This mutation (A149P), was found in several apparently unrelated patients in the United Kingdom." We report here the distribution of the A149P mutation in Europe and the United States. Furthermore, we have characterised two new genetic lesions in HFI and have examined their distribution.  Subjects and methods 50 patients with HFI, from 41 independent families, were studied. The patients were from the UK, France, Switzerland, Italy, Yugoslavia, and the USA. HFI was diagnosed on the basis of clinical history and the intravenous fructose tolerance test; in some cases it was confirmed by assay of fructaldolase activities in tissue biopsy samples? 3 UK patients were considered to be affected on the basis of a typical history of dietary intolerance with episodes suggestive of hypoglycaemia. There were 2 sisters, aged 3 and 7 years, who were found to be homozygous for the A149P mutation, and a 54-year-old woman with life-long symptoms of fructose intolerance, who also carried the A149P allele. DNA was prepared from peripheral blood leucocytes12 or from crude lysates of buccal epithelial cells obtained from saline mouthwashes.13 95% confidence limits (CL) of allele frequencies in population samples were derived from exact values of the binomial distribution by entering the observed allele frequencies in different samples.14 The significance of differences in the proportion of alleles between TABLE III-GENOTYPES OF PROBANDS  the sample groups was determined by the four-fold contingency test.14 The polymerase chain reaction15 (PCR) was used to amplify DNA in a home-made thermocycling apparatus with Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer Cetus). 16 To optimise specificity, the annealing temperature was varied between 45&deg;C and 55&deg;C and the magnesium (Mg2+) concentration between 1-0 mmol/1 and 1-5 mmol/1. Blank (no DNA) controls were routinely run in parallel to ensure that the reaction components were free of contaminating aldolase B sequences. Primers used for amplication of aldolase B exons were derived from the genomic sequence17 as shown in table 1. Each fragment contained the entire coding sequence of that exon, plus splice junctions and lariat branch points. Amplified exons were sequenced either directly after production of single-stranded DNA by PCR with unequal primer concentrations18 or by cloning fragments into the Small site of pEMBL19. Reactions were carried out by the chain terminator method with ’Sequenase’ (USB) according to the manufacturer’s  recommendations. For genotype analysis, exons 5 and 8 were amplified by PCR and about 100 ng of the product was immobilised on nylon membranes (’Hybond N’, Amersham) by either dot blotting or Southern blotting after electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels. Spots of wild-type and mutant plasmids were included to serve as hybridisation controls. Filters were prehybridised in 6 x SSC (SSC=0-015 mol/1 sodium citrate, 0-15 mol/1 sodium chloride), 5 x Denhardt’s solution (5 x = Ficoll 0-1%, polyvinylpyrrolidone 0-1%, bovine serum albumin 0&deg; 1 %), 100 jig/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, for 2 h at 65&deg;C, then hybridised overnight at 37&deg;C by the addition of 100 ng y-phosphorus-32 end-labelled oligonucleotide probe (about 10g cpm/g) to the prehybridisation solution. Blots were washed three times in 6 x SSC, 0-01 % sodium dodecyl sulphate at room temperature and exposed to film for 30-60 min. This low-stringency wash served as a control for the amount of target DNA generated in the PCR and to ensure that the probe had hybridised efficiently. Two high-stringency washes were carried out at the appropriate discriminatory temperature for 2 min in 6 x SSC, 0-01% sodium dodecyl sulphate. Allele-specific oligonucleotides and discriminatory temperatures are given in table n. Filters were stripped of probe by heating to 80&deg;C in 0-01% sodium dodecyl sulphate before hybridisation with another  oligonucleotide.  Results Exon 5 was amplified from each subject’s DNA and probed with A149P and A149wt (wild-type) oligonucleotides. After washing at high stringency, hybridisation to the A149P probe only showed that the subject was homozygous for this mutation. Hybridisation to both probes indicated an A149P compound heterozygote in which the wild-type signal originated from a different mutant allele. A signal with only the wild-type probe indicated that the subject did not carry A149P on either of his or her defective aldolase B genes. Table III shows the genotypes of the probands and table IV the allele frequencies among all the subjects studied. A149P was prevalent in all the countries studied; the allele frequency in HFI patients was 67 1% (95% CL 55-8TABLE IV-ALLELE FREQUENCIES  *In 1 affected  family 3 independent segregating alleles were defined. tHeterozygous for L288AC tHomozygous for L288AC.  308  Fig 1-Mutations in defective aldolase B alleles.  77-%) overall. There seemed to be a north-south gradient in the frequency of the mutation-A149P was significantly more prevalent in the UK than in Italy (table III; p < 0-05). Of the 41 independent pedigrees, 20 probands (49%) were homozygous for A149P and 14 (34%) were compound heterozygotes with A149P on one of the mutant alleles. Of the 50 patients studied, 7 did not carry the A149P mutation on either mutant allele. 2 such patients, both from Sicily, were selected for further study. Exons 2-9, which include the complete coding region for aldolase B, were amplified and sequenced. A single point mutation was identified in each; no other lesions were found. The first patient carried a transition, C-A, in exon 5 which results in the replacement of the invariant alanine residue (GCC) at position 174 of the normal protein by an aspartic acid residue (GAC). The mutation was therefore termed A174D. The second patient carried a single base-pair deletion. The C residue of the codon for leucine at position 288 in exon 8 was absent; this allele was designated L288AC. This frameshift mutation creates a stop codon at position 297, so a protein truncated by 67 residues would be produced (fig 1). These lesions neither generate nor destroy restriction sites, and to detect them in genomic DNA, allele-specific oligonucleotide probes were synthesised for their respective wild-type and mutant sequences. Hybridisation of these probes to amplified exon 5 and exon 8 sequences showed that these 2 patients were homozygous for their respective mutations, despite the fact that neither was apparently the product of a consanguineous marriage.  Fig 2-Genotype analysis of representative HFI patients. Patients 1, 2, 6, and 8 were homozygous for Al 49 P; patient 3 was homozygous for A174D; patients 4, 5, and 10 had genotypes A149P/ A174D; patient 7 A149P/unknown; patient 9 both alleles unknown.  The A174D mutation occurs in exon 5; the filters prepared for the analysis of A149P were stripped and reprobed with A174D and A174wt allele-specific oligonucleotides. The genotype analysis of representative HFI patients is shown in fig 2. We found Al 74D in several of our patients from Switzerland, Italy, and Yugoslavia but not in those from the UK, France, or the USA. The frequency of independent A174D alleles was 15-9% (13/82; 95% CL 8-7%-25-6%) overall-30% (8 of 27) in Switzerland and 22% (4 of 18) in Italy. This mutation also accounted for one allele of the single Yugoslavian patient. In all, 2 of the 41 patients were A174D homozygotes and 9 were A174D compound heterozygotes, of which 7 were A149P/A174D. Of the 82 independent alleles studied, 68 (83%) were either A149P or A174D. Patients with as yet uncharacterised lesions were tested for the L288AC and L288wt oligonucleotides. Only 2 subjects, both originating from Sicily, were positive for this deletion. The first was homozygous, and the second was an A149P/L288AC compound heterozygote. These subjects were not known to be related.  Discussion We have previously described the identification of the A149P point mutation and speculated that this substitution would disrupt the spatial configuration of important residues (Lys 146 and Arg 148) on the 0 strand of the aldolase B substrate-binding pocket.10 We have now characterised two more mutant aldolase B alleles and used the PCR and allele-specific oligonucleotide probes to detect these lesions in genomic DNA. The first lesion is another mis-sense mutation (C-A) that results in the replacement of the normal alanine residue at position 174 by an aspartic acid residue (A174D). The alanine 174 residue is conserved in all the aldolase isozymes studied so far, including those of vertebrates, maize, and Drosophila.19 Furthermore, in the crystal structure of rabbit aldolase A 20 Ala 174 is found in an It.-helical region that is juxtaposed to the substrate-binding residues described above. The Al 74D substitution results in a change of charge that is likely to affect vicinal residues in this important region. Both A149P and A174D are located on exon 5 of human aldolase B and may thus be conveniently detected by probing the same filter with their respective mutant and wild-type oligonucleotides. The second lesion is a frameshift mutation caused by the deletion of a single C residue at Leu 288. The change predicts a mutant protein that is shortened by 67 aminoacids and therefore lacks several conserved regions, including the carboxy-terminus, which is important for normal activity. 21 A149P was found in patients from throughout western Europe and also in patients from the USA, though there seemed to be a north-south gradient in its frequency in Europe. In this study, A174D was restricted to patients from Switzerland, Italy, and Yugoslavia. The frameshift mutation L288AC was found only in 2 Sicilian patients (3 of 10 HFI alleles from that island). Although these 2 subjects were apparently unrelated and came from different regions of Sicily, it remains possible that this lesion is confined to 1 extensive family. To ascertain whether L288AC is prevalent in Sicily and Sicilian-derived populations, it would be necessary to analyse a larger sample of patients from the region. At the end of this study, 11 of 82 (134%; 95% CL  6-9-22-7%)  mutant  alleles  were  unaccounted  for.  309  Preliminary studies of 4 of these show that each carries a different deletion, ranging in size from 4 bp to 1-6 kilobases (unpublished). It is possible that the 7 remaining uncharacterised alleles also represent private mutations and that the frequency of this category reflects the rate of new mutation at the human aldolase B locus. Infants at weaning who suffer from HFI show signs of food rejection and failure to thrive. It is at this age that affected patients would benefit most from definitive diagnosis so that rigorous dietary treatment could be instituted. Most patients acquire a strong distaste for sweet-tasting foods, but many suffer episodically throughout life as a result of inadvertent ingestion of noxious foods and drinkS.l,3,8,11 Existing methods of diagnosis (intravenous fructose tolerance test and tissue biopsy Y are invasive. We predict that the great majority of individuals may be diagnosed by direct testing for the presence of prevalent mutant aldolase B alleles. Such testing can conveniently be carried out on DNA extracted from small samples of blood or from buccal epithelial cells derived from saline mouthwashes.1u3 We have identified two common HFI alleles and a third which may be an important cause of the disease in Sicily. A149P and A174D both occur in exon 5 and thus may be sought after a single PCR amplification. We envisage that this search may eventually be achieved by use of amplified exon 5 sequences to probe four immobilised allele-specific oligonucleotides, so constructed that their discriminating temperatures for hybridisation are identical. This method of analysis has been successfully applied to the diagnosis of  &bgr;-thalassaemia.22 In our sample of  82 independent alleles, 71 (86-7%; 95% CL 77 3-93 1 %) were accounted for by the three mutations described above. At the lower limit, therefore, we would expect 60% of HFI patients (0-7732 x 100) to carry at least one of these lesions on both alleles, 35% to be compound heterozygotes of one common allele and an unknown mutation, and only 5% to possess two undefined mutant alleles. In practice, we found that of the 41 probands examined, 31 (76%) could be genotypically defined, 8 (19-5%) could be defined for one allele only, 2 (5%) carried unknown aldolase B lesions. It has been estimated23 that the frequency of HFI may be as high as 1 in 20 000 live births. The corresponding frequency of carriers in the population would be approximately 1 in 70. We consider the finding of a single mutant allele in an individual giving a typical nutritional history or suffering from symptoms of HFI to be highly suggestive of the disorder, since the probability that the patient is a simple heterozygote for HFI, with symptoms due to an unrelated cause, would be less than 2%. Thus, at the lowest confidence limit of allele frequencies, the probability of diagnosing fructose intolerance by direct detection of the molecular lesions described here is greater than 95%.

Then  as  A street  Now  danger  It is long since the first protest was directed against the dangerous and untidy, but very common, practice of throwing down fruit skins at random in the public way. Yet, as if road and pavement, coated by the frosts of winter, were not slippery enough, we still see freely distributed upon them those treacherous fragments of orange-peel, apple-parings, and the like, which experience and precaution have condemned as the frequent causes of accident. Familiar as the evil is, its effectual correction is by no means a simple matter. Advice in abundance has been applied in vain. Carelessness will not be thus instructed, and the difficulty is not the less that the offender is often a child. Still, the matter is not hopelessly beyond a chance of amendment.... We think it reasonable that every householder should clear the snow from the approach to his dwelling. Is it out of the question that consumers of fruit be likewise required, on pain of a moderate fine, to refrain from littering the streets with dangerous waste? (From The Lancet of 4 January 1890)  Molecular analysis of aldolase B genes in hereditary fructose intolerance.The molecular basis of hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) was studied in 50 subjects (41 pedigrees, 82 apparently independent mutant alleles of aldolase B) by direct analysis of aldolase B genes amplified by means of the polymerase chain reaction. The mutation A149P (ala 149----pro) was found in 67% of alleles but was significantly more common in patients from northern than from southern Europe. Two other point mutations of aldolase B were identified. A174D (C----A; ala 174----asp) was found in subjects from Italy, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia (overall frequency 16%) but not in those from the United Kingdom, France, or the United States. L288 delta C carried a single base-pair deletion causing frameshift at codon 288 and was restricted to Sicilian subjects. By testing for these mutations in amplified DNA with a limited panel of allele-specific oligonucleotides, more than 95% of HFI patients will be susceptible to genetic diagnosis."

This missense mutation converts a highly conserved arginine residue (Arg403) to a glutamine. Affected individuals from an unrelated family lack this missense mutation, but instead have an a/j3 cardiac MHC hybrid gene. Identification of two unique mutations within cardiac MHC genes in all individuals with FHC from two unrelated families demonstrates that defects in the cardiac MHC genes can cause this disease. The pathology resulting from a missense mutation at residue 403 further suggests that a critical function of myosin is disrupted by this mutation.  Identification of the genetic defect responsible for a disease such as familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) has proven to be a difficult task. There are approximately 1200 human diseases that, like FHC, are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. The molecular basis of less than 60 of these has been established (McKusick, 1966). One approach to elucidating the molecular etiology of an autosomal dominant disease has been to identify a candidate gene, often suggested by linkage analyses, and then to demonstrate that the protein encoded by this gene has an altered function in affected individuals. Application of this approach to FHC is difficult because the affected tissue (cardiac muscle) is not readily available for analysis and because specific biochemical assays for many functions of the candidate protein (myosin heavy chain) do not exist.  We have previously demonstrated that a gene responsible for FHC is linked to the a and p cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) genes (Solomon et al., 1990a). These genes are excellent candidates for causing this disorder because they are expressed in the heart, the principal organ that exhibits pathology in FHC. Furthermore, in animal models of cardiac hypertrophy, expression of the a and 6 cardiac MHC genes is altered (Izumo et al., 1987). While similar analyses of the expression of the a and 9 cardiac MHC genes in humans with FHC have not confirmed these findings, such studies have been limited to immunohistochemical techniques (Mercadier et al., 1983; Hirzel et al., 1985). Recently, the human f3 cardiac MHC gene has been cloned and the complete nucleotide sequence determined (Liew et al., 1990; Jaenicke et al., 1990). Less is known about the human a cardiac MHC gene, which has been only partially cloned and characterized (Kurabayashi et al., 1988; YamauchirTakihara et al., 1989). Another approach to elucidating whether a candidate gene causes a particular disorder is to demonstrate that unrelated and affected individuals have mutations in the same candidate gene. We have recently demonstrated that individuals with FHC from one family bear a mutation in their cardiac MHC genes (Tanigawa et al., 1990 [accompanying article]) that produces an a/f3 cardiac MHC hybrid gene. These data suggested that mutations in the cardiac MHC genes cause FHC, but could not definitively exclude the possibility that the MHC mutation was closely linked to a gene that was principally responsible for the disease. To demonstrate conclusively that mutations in the cardiac MHC genes cause FHC, we sought to identify cardiac MHC gene defects in affected individuals from other, unrelated families. FHC is a genetically heterogeneous disorder (Solomon et al., 1990b). A locus responsible for this disease, on chromosome 14 band qll-12, is designated #/C-I. The first step in our analyses involved identifying a family in which the disease is caused by a mutation in the FHC-1 locus. The gene responsible for FHC in a large French Canadian kindred (Figure lA, family A) is located at FHC-7, closely linked to the cardiac MHC genes (Jarcho et al., 1989; Solomon et al., 1990a). We have designated the affected allele in this family FHC-la. The second step in our analyses involved characterizing the a and 6 cardiac MHC genes of the FHC-la allele to determine if they contained a mutation that should alter a cardiac MHC polypeptide. We now report that affected individuals from family A have a missense mutation in their f3 cardiac MHC gene. This point mutation replaces a highly conserved arginine residue with a glutamine residue. This finding represents the identification of a second, independent mutation within the cardiac MHC genes of affected individuals with FHC. Since mutations in the cardiac MHC genes are present in two unrelated families with this disease, we conclude that mutations in the cardiac MHC genes cause FHC in some families. Furthermore, because the missense mutation present in family A alters an amino acid that has been  Cdl 1000  highly conserved throughout evolution, we speculate that this mutation affects a critical function of the MHC molecule. Results The a and p cardiac MHC genes are only 4.5 kb apart (Saez et al., 1987; Matsuoka et al., 1989). Each gene consists of 40 exons and encompasses approximately 30 kb of DNA. A simple and rapid method for identifying mutations within a large gene(s), like the cardiac MHC genes, has not been devised. One could determine the nucleotide sequence of the putative mutated gene and compare this to the nucleotide sequence of the normal gene. The entire nucleotide sequence of the human p cardiac MHC gene has been determined (Liew et al., 1990; Jaenicke et al., 1990), but comparable data on the a cardiac MHC gene are currently unavailable. This direct approach would therefore require nucleotide sequence analysis of 30 kb of genomic DNA from a normal a cardiac MHC gene and 80 kb of DNA containing the a and p cardiac MHC genes from an affected individual. If, however, a mutation altered a restriction enzyme recognition site, one could identify this by Southern blot analyses of DNA from affected individuals. Given the size of the cardiac MHC genes, we elected to begin our analyses with the latter approach. To determine if the cardiac MHC genes of affected individuals in family A contained a mutation similar to that detected in affected individuals of family B (Tanigawa et al., 1990), the restriction enzyme maps of the a and p cardiac MHC genes from affected and unaffected individuals were compared (see Figure 2). Southern blot analyses were performed with several restriction enzymes that recognize 8 bp sites. These blots were hybridized to probes derived from the a and p cardiac MHC genes (see Figure 2). All restriction fragments identified in the DNAs of affected individuals were identical in size to those found in the DNAof unaffected family members, suggesting that the cardiac MHC genes in the #K-la allele were not grossly altered. To study the structure of the cardiac MHC genes of affected individuals at higher resolution, these genes were cloned and characterized by fine-structure restriction enzyme site mapping and nucleotide sequence analysis. DNA fragments derived from the a and p cardiac MHC genes of affected individual II-1 (Figure 1A) were cloned into bacteriophage h (Experimental Procedures). Because the a and p cardiac MHC genes are highly homologous to each other and to the other MHC genes, we did not attempt to clone these genes directly from a genomic bacteriophage library. Rather, we first identified restriction fragments in Southern blots that were specifically derived from either the a or p cardiac MHC genes, using DNA probes that recognized particular portions of these genes. Isolated fragments (Figure 2, fragments BB-17, 0X-15, PB12, aH-17, aE-15, aH-7) were then cloned into bacteriophage vectors. To be certain that both alleles containing the cardiac MHC genes had been cloned, multiple independently iso-  lated clones containing each a or B cardiac MHC fragment were obtained. These were analyzed for unique restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Individual II-1 has been shown previously to be heterozygous for a BamHl RFLP detected by probe PE-4.3 (Solomon et al., 1990a). This and newly identified polymorphisms (our unpublished data) found in the cardiac MHC genes were used to distinguish clones that were derived from the MHC genes of the normal allele and the FHC-la allele of affected individual 11-l. The identification of two clones containing the same restriction fragment from either the a or the p cardiac MHC gene, but which were polymorphic at one of these sites, provided evidence that each clone represented one of the two alleles present in individual 11-1.Bacteriophage clones derived from each allele spanned 20 kb of the p cardiac MHC gene and 28 kb of the a cardiac MHC gene. No polymorphisms were identified in clones aH-7 that could discriminate between alleles. One clone representing each allele was then selected for detailed characterization by digestion with 20 restriction enzymes. The orientation of each allelic clone with respect to vector sequences was identical. In the 20 kb of cloned sequences derived from the p cardiac MHC gene and the 26 kb of cloned sequences derived from the a cardiac MHC gene, six different RFLPs were detected between clones derived from the two alleles found in individual II-1 (Figure 2, arrows). To ascertain if any of these six polymorphisms could represent the mutation causing FHC in family A, several analyses were performed. We determined if any of these polymorphisms segregated with the disease by Southern blot analyses of genomic DNA from selected family members. Candidate polymorphisms were then characterized by nucleotide sequence analysis to determine if a mutation that yielded a polymorphism also altered encoded protein sequences. DNAs from unrelated individuals were then screened to determine the frequency of identified polymorphisms in the general population. Previous analyses have demonstrated that the BamHl polymorphism present in the p cardiac MHC gene segregates with FHC in family A (Solomon et al., 1990a). However, since this RFLP is also present in families without FHC, it cannot be a mutation responsible for the disease. An EcoRl polymorphism was identified in the region separating the a and p cardiac MHC genes but was present in only three individuals in family A and did not segregate with the disease. Four polymorphic differences were detected between a cardiac MHC gene segments derived from each allele of individual II-l. Two of these, a Hhal and an Alul polymorphism, are present in intron 1 of the a cardiac MHC gene (data not shown). The Hhal polymorphism identified in the clones derived from the FHC-la allele of individual II-1 is also present in unaffected individuals. A Ddel polymorphism and a polymorphism resulting from a difference in the length of avariable nucleotide tandem repeat (Figure 2, TR) were also identified in intron sequences of the a cardiac MHC gene (data not shown). Since four of these newly identified polymorphisms are located within intron sequences and are unlikely to alter the  A 5 Cardiac MHC Missense Mutation Causes FHC 1001  A  B  W  II-12 II-34  III-9 III-10  Figure 1.

A sixth polymorphic difference was observed after Ddel digestion of the two allelic clones encoding the 17 kb BamHl fragment of the 5 cardiac MHC gene. These clones extend from a BamHl site located 10 kb 5’ of the 5 cardiac MHC gene through exon 15 (Figure 2, 56-17). Digestion of these clones with Ddel yielded approximately 30 DNA restriction fragments. All but one Ddel fragment derived from the two allelic clones comigrated. A 425 bp Ddel fragment was produced from the Be-17 clone derived from the unaffected allele, while a 385 bp fragment was obtained from the FHCl* allele. The genetic linkage relationship between the WC-7 locus and the Ddel polymporphism was determined in family A. The 425 bp Ddel fragment was isolated from the 5B17 clone derived from the unaffected allele and subcloned  a  into a plasmid designated f3D-,425. This probe was hybridized to Southern blots of Ddel-digested DNA from all members of family A. Probe PD-.425 detects a constant band of 300 bp in Ddel digests of DNA from all individuals (Figure 1B). This probably corresponds to an a cardiac MHC gene fragment, since Ddel digestion of the corresponding cloned region of the a cardiac MHC gene yielded a fragment of similar size after hybridization to pD.425 (data not shown). Two polymorphic fragments, 425 bp (allele 1) and 385 bp band (allele 2), were also identified in DNA digested with Ddel from members of family A (Figure 1B). These restriction fragments are inherited in a Mendelian fashion; the 385 bp DNA fragment found in individual II-12 was inherited by three of four children. Figure 1A shows the genotype of all individuals in family A. Allele 2 was observed only in digests of DNA obtained from affected family members. Among members of family A there was a perfect correlation between inheritance of allele 2 and inheritance of FHC. Assuming a disease penetrance for FHC of 0.95 (Clark et al., 1973), the maximum LOD (logarithm of the odds) score for coinheritance  Figure 2.

Gln  of allele 2 and FHC in this family was 15.9 (8 = 0). (The frequencies of alleles 1 and 2 used for these calculations  were 0.98 and 0.02, respectively, although the data presented below suggest that the frequency of allele 2 is less than 0.005.) These data demonstrate that the probability that the polymorphic Ddel site is not linked to the FHC-7 locus is less than 1 in 1015. While these dataconfirmed that the cardiac MHC genes are genetically linked to the FHC-7 locus, they do not differentiate between a polymorphism linked to the disease locus and a disease-causing mutation. To clarify this relationship, we performed Southern blot analyses using DNA from unaffected and unrelated individuals. If the mutation that produced allele 2 of the Ddel polymorphism also caused FHC, this polymorphism should not be present in unaffected individuals. Southern blot analyses failed to detect the 385 bp fragment (allele 2) in Ddel digests of the DNA from 104 individuals (data not shown). These data suggest that the frequency of allele 2 is less than 0.005 (<l/208) in the normal population. We concluded that the 385 bp fragment present in Ddel digests from affected individuals cosegregates exclusively with the F/-/C-P allele. To ascertain whether the mutation responsible for the Ddel polymorphism affects the expression or function of the 5 cardiac MHC polypeptide, we determined the nucleotide sequences of the normal allele and the FHCla allele in the region encoding the Ddel polymorphism. Restriction enzyme mapping suggested that clone pD.425 was derived from exon 13 of the 5 cardiac MHC gene (data not shown). We determined the nucleotide sequences of axon 13 of clones 56-17 derived from the normal and FHC-la alleles. These were identical except for a single nucleotide change (Figure 3). A guanine residue present in the clone derived from the unaffected allele at position 10,182 (enumerated as in Jaenicke et al., 1990) is mutated to an adenine residue in the clone derived from  the F/G-la allele. The nucleotide sequence of the 5 cardiac MHC gene has been previously determined by two independent laboratories (Liew et al., 1990; Jaenicke et al., 1990), and both document a guanine residue at position 10,182. The identified mutation generates a new Ddel site and thus accounts for the Ddel polymorphism found in the F/G-la allele. The observed nucleotide substitution in the FHC-la allele also changes arginine residue 403, encoded by a CGG codon, to a glutamine residue encoded by a CAG codon. The resultant Gln residue should significantly alter the structure of the 5 cardiac MHC polypeptide in this region because this amino acid substitution is accompanied by a change in charge from +l to 0. Dlscuaelon We have demonstrated that a unique mutation exists in the cardiac MHC genes of individuals with FHC from a large kindred. A missense mutation present in exon 13 of the f3 cardiac MHC gene of affected members in family A converts an arginine residue to a glutamine residue. To assess the importance of a particular amino acid residue in the function of a polypeptide, one can determine if that residue is conserved through evolution. The amino acid sequences of 15 different MHC polypeptides have been determined from a variety of species. Figure 4 illustrates the amino acid sequence of exon 13 from these 15 different myosin polypeptides. Arginine residue 403 is contained in a region of six highly conserved amino acids, 402-408 (PRVKVG), and is one of five amino acids that is invariant in all 15 sequences of exon 13. The largest evolutionary distance between the characterized MHC polypeptides (Figure 4) is the distance between man and amoeba (Acanthamoeba castellanii); this divergence is thought to have occurred at least 800 million year3 ago  A$$ardiac  MHC Missense Mutation Causes FHC  Figure 4.

The finding that the missense mutation in a coding portion of the 9 cardiac MHC gene alters an arginine residue that has been conserved for over 600 million years provides further evidence that the mutation defined by the Ddel polymorphism is responsible for FHC in affected members of family A. The MHC polypeptide\Figure 5) has two functional domains (reviewed in Harrington and Rodgers, 1994): a globular head region (Sl) and an elongated rod region (S2 and LMM). The head region contains the ATPase activity of the molecule and the subregions that bind to myosin light chains and actin polypeptides. The head region appear8 to be critical for structural transitions of the actin-myosin Complex that are coupled to release of inorganic phosphate from ATP The missense mutation identified in exon 13 of the 3 cardiac MHC gene from individual8 with FHC  Globular e L 1  2  23K  3 4 56  4  ATG  789  1011  Rod /s2 i  12 13,415  161718  AcGn  ATP  would alter the amino acid structure of the globular head region of the myosin molecule. The mutationally altered residue is not one previously associated with specific ATPase function or actin binding. However, because this mutation occurs in a sequence that is highly conserved in evolutionarily distant species, we Speculate that this conserved segment of the MHC polypeptide is important for one of these or a previously unidentified function. We anticipate that characterization of the altered MHC polypeptide resulting from this missense mutation and identification of other mutations that cause FHC will help to elucidate novel structure-function relationship8 of the myosin molecules. The missense mutation occur8 only in the B cardiac MHC gene of affected individuals.

(1990). Locations of exons encoding the ATPase activity and the actin binding activity associated with the head region of the MHC polypeptide are also indicated. Several proteolytic fragments (St, 23K, 50K, 24K, S2, 51K, LMM, and 77K) that can be obtained by digestion of skeletal myosin heavy chain polypeptides are indicated. The hinge region located within the rod regions of the polypeptide is identified. The gene is arranged in a 5’ to 3’ orientation and is colinear with the polypeptide, which is arranged in an amino-terminal to carboxyterminal orientation.  Cdl 1004  cles, while human a cardiac MHC genes are expressed only in cardiac tissue (Lichter et al., 1988; Saez and Leinwand, 1988). Thus, a 8 cardiac MHC gene mutation might cause abnormalities of skeletal muscle. The predominant pathology detected in individuals with FHC occurs in the heart; however, recent data suggest that skeletal muscle function is also perturbed in some, but not all, individuals with FHC (Caforio et al., 1989). The finding that some FHC-7 mutations occur in 8 cardiac MHC genes (like FHC73 might explain the presence of skeletal muscle dysfunction in these individuals. By contrast, some FHC-7 mutations affect a cardiac MHC gene sequences (for example, the a/p cardiac MHC hybrid gene in WC-lb; Tanigawa et al., 1990) and individuals with such mutations should have defects in their heart muscle but not their skeletal muscle. MHC polypeptides interact with myosin light chains, actin, troponin, and tropomyosin molecules. The physiologic interactions between myosin and other myofibrillar proteins have implications for other families with FHC. FHC is a genetically heterogeneous disorder (Solomon et al., 1990b). The FHC locus in at least two other families is not linked to the cardiac MHC genes (Solomon et al., 1990b). At present, the location of the disease locus in these other families is unknown. Demonstration that mutations in the MHC genes can cause FHC in two families suggests that defects in the genes encoding myosin-associated peptides may also cause FHC in families whose disease is not linked to the cardiac MHC genes. Independent genetic events producing mutations of the cardiac MHC genes have resulted in FHC in two families. In family A (WC-la), a missense mutation alters a highly conserved amino acid within the head region of the molecule. In an unrelated family B (F/%-lb), we have identified an a/f3 cardiac MHC hybrid gene that appears to have resulted from an unequal crossover event (Tanigawa et al., 1990). Since the cardiac MHC gene mutations that cause FHC have been characterized in only two families, we cannot yet predict whether most affected individuals bear either of these two alleles (indicating that there is a strong founder effect) or whether the disease occurs principally as a result of new mutations. There are practical implications for determining the number of unique mutations within the cardiac MHC gene that can cause FHC. Diagnosis at present is based on clinical evaluations, particularly electrocardiography and two-dimensional echocardiography. Accurate diagnosis can be difficult, especially in children. Development of genetic probes that determine disease status with certainty will be difficult if multiple unique mutations in the cardiac MHC genes cause FHC. The mechanism by which mutations in the cardiac MHC genes produce cardiac hypertrophy is unknown. Our analyses suggest that different types of mutations in the cardiac MHC genes cause similar clinical diseases. One explanation for a common pathology produced by these apparently dissimilar mutations may relate to the ratio of a and 8 cardiac MHC polypeptides within cardiac cells. If appropriate assembly of myofibrils requires a critical ratio of a and 8 cardiac MHC peptides, then a mutation that results in aberrant 8 cardiac MHC polypeptides could be  functionally comparable to a mutation that causes an absolute increase in a-like cardiac MHC polypeptides. Characterization of the mutant cardiac MHC polypeptides found in cardiac muscle of affected individuals should significantly improve our understanding of the mechanism by which defects in the cardiac MHC genes cause cardiac hypertrophy. An intriguing question arising from these data is how mutations in the cardiac MHC genes produce an autosomal dominant disease. Two models can be proposed to account for a dominant phenotype produced by mutations that alter a protein’s function. If myosin gene mutations, like mutations of the retinoblastoma gene, act in a recessive fashion even though they are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (Cavenee et al., 1983), then a mutation that alters the normal allele may be required for disease expression. That is, perhaps the pathologic findings in FHC result from a second, independent mutation in the cardiac MHC genes in myocytes that already contain a mutant MHC gene. Such cells should be unable to produce functional myosin molecules. A difficulty with this model is that cells which contain two mutationally altered MHC genes lack any apparent selective advantage. An alternative explanation for the autosomal dominant phenotype might be that production of some aberrant MHC polypeptides poisons assembly of many myosin molecules. Biochemical analyses of the myofilaments in cardiac tissues from patients with FHC should improve our understanding of the mechanisms of myofibrillar assembly and may explain the autosomal dominant mode of inheritance of this disease. Unexplained myocardial hypertrophy is a major clinical feature of FHC. However, there are many human diseases in which secondary myocardial hypertrophy occurs. For example, cardiac hypertrophy is associated with chronic hypertension, valvular heart disease, and endocrine or metabolic disorders. In some of these, histopathologic findings of myocyte and myofibrillar disarray are present, although quantitatively less than that seen in FHC. The molecular mechanism for development of secondary hypertrophy in human diseases is unknown; however, experimental animal models have demonstrated altered cardiac MHC gene expression (Izumo et al., 1987). These studies and the data presented here suggest that changes in the expression of cardiac MHC genes may be etiologic in the development of myocardial hypertrophy which occurs secondary to other diseases. Understanding the mechanism by which mutations in the cardiac MHC genes produce the pathology characteristic of FHC may elucidate a molecular basis for myocyte growth and development and provide new insights into how these are altered in other human diseases. ExPerimental Procedures Cell Lines, DNA ExtractIon, and Southern Blot Analysis Genomic DNA from family A individuals was obtained from lymphoblastoid cell lines as described previously (Holcombe et al., 1997; Tanigawa et al., 1990). Southern blot analyses(Southern, 1975)were performed as described, with the following modifications. Ddeldigested genomic DNA (30 ug) was electmphoresed in 3% Nuseive  A 6 Cardiac MHC Missense 1005  Mutation Causes FHC  (American Bioanalytical), 1% agarose gels GeneScreen Plus (New England Nuclear).  and  transferred  to  DNA Probes fmm the Cardiac MHC Genes Probes were isolated from the cardiac MHC genes as indicated in Fig ure 2. Probe 6H-1.3 was isolated from the human genomic clone gMHC-2 (Diederich et al., 1989). Probe aHBg-3 was isolated from p81A, a gift from L. A. Leinwand (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY). Probe f3D-,425 was isolated from clone BE-17 (derived from an unaffected allele) and subcloned into the plasmid Bluescript II SK- (Stratagene). Fragments used for probes were isolated, after digestion with the appropriate restriction enzyme(s) and subsequent fractionation, from agarose gels by standard procedures. Probes were radiolabeled with [a-32P]dCTP (New England Nuclear) using the random hexamer priming method (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1984). Cloning Cardiac MHC Gene Fragments from Affected and Unaffected lndlvlduals The procedure for cloning genomic DNA restriction fragments derived from the cardiac MHC genes from the affected or unaffected allele involved the following steps (Ausubel et al., 1989). DNA (300 pg) from patient II-I was digested with BarnHI, EcoRI, Xhol. or Hindlll, and fractionated on lo%-40% sucrose gradients. The fraction(s) enriched in a particular DNA fragment was identified by Southern blot analysis using the DNA probes indicated below. Subgenomic libraries were made from the enriched DNA fraction after ethanol precipitation, ligation into bacteriophage cloning vectors, and in vitro packaging with Gigapackll Gold. Reagents for library construction were from Stratagene. Probe pE-4.3 was used to identify the sucrose gradient fractions enriched for the 15 kb Xhol, 7 kb Hindlll, and 12 kb BamHl fragments present in the DNA from affected individual II-1 and to select clones 8X-15, aH-7, and f3B12 from the subgenomic library prepared from each enriched fraction. Similarly, probes 8H-1.3 and aHBg-3 were used to identify the enriched fractions used to prepare subgenomic libraries for the selection of clones 8B-17 and aH-17, respectively. DNA Sequencing DNA sequence was determined from plasmid subclones of fragment be-17 by the dideoxy chain termination reaction (Sanger et al., 1977) using a bacteriophage T7 polymerase kit (Pharmacia) and [a-35S] dATP (New England Nuclear). The primer for exon 13 (5’-TTACCAACTTTGCTACTlGCCTTT-3r) was synthesized (model 3808, Applied Biosystems) according to previously determined sequence (Jaenicke et al., 1990). University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group software (Devereux et al.. 1984) was used for sequence analysis.

"1","We demonstrate that familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC), an autosomal dominant disorder of heart muscle, is a genetically heterogeneous disease. The locus responsible for FHC in members of one large kindred was recently mapped to chromosome 14q11-12 (FHC-1). We have characterized three additional unrelated families in which the gene for FHC segregates as an autosomal dominant trait to determine if these disease loci also map to FHC-1. All family members were clinically studied by physical examination, electrocardiogram, and two-dimensional echocardiography. Genetic studies were performed using DNA probes which are derived from loci that are closely linked to FHC-1. In one family the genetic defect maps to the previously identified FHC-1 locus. However, the loci responsible for FHC in two other families were not linked to FHC-1. We conclude that FHC can be caused by defects in at least two loci and is a genetically heterogeneous disorder.Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetically heterogeneous disease."

Genet. 47:1008-1012, 1990  The NT 1311 Polymorphism of G6PD: G6PD Mediterranean Mutation May Have Originated Independently in Europe and Asia Ernest Beutler and Wanda Kuhl Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, CA  Summary A polymorphic site exists in exon 11 of G6PD: in the wild-type enzyme, nucleotide (NT) 1311 is a C, but is some individuals from diverse populations a T is present instead. Nine of 54 X chromosomes from Europeans of mixed origins, nine of 41 X chromosomes of Ashkenazi Jewish subjects, three of 18 X chromosomes of Sicilians, five of 20 African X chromosomes, and nine of 20 Asian Indian X chromosomes had the mutant genotype. In contrast, the mutation was found in only three of 59 Oriental X chromosomes and in three of 30 Central/South American X chromosomes. The mutation was absent from four samples of chimpanzee DNA. Twenty-one of 22 male subjects from Mediterranean countries who had the G6PD Mediterranean563T genotype investigated in the present study or reported previously had a T at NT 1311. Only one had the normal C at NT 1311. In contrast, both G6PD Mediterranean563T males from the Indian subcontinent had the normal C at NT 1311. These findings suggest that the same mutation at nucleotide 563 giving rise to G6PD Mediterranean may have arisen independently in Europe and in Asia. Introduction When Martini et al. (1986) and Persico et al. (1986a, 1986b) and, subsequently, Takizawa et al. (1986) and Yoshida and Takizawa (1986) cloned and sequenced human G6PD, it was hoped that this gene, which had played such an important role in the development of mammalian genetics, would contain many polymorphic sites that might prove useful in further investigations. Unfortunately, the results of analysis with restriction endonucleases were disappointing. An extensive search for RFLPs by d'Urso et al. (1988) yielded only a single mutation, a silent change of nucleotide (NT) 1116 that destroys a PstI site in 22% of Nigerians. However, another mutation, creating a PvuII site in intron 5 was found by Yoshida et al. (1988 ) and recently was studied in a larger population by Fey et al. (1990).

The studies of De Vita et al. (1989) in Sardinia have suggested that still another polymorphism, one that does not give rise to a restriction site, may exist. These investigators found that in all patients with the NT 563 COT mutation that is characteristic of G6PD Mediterranean (Vulliamy et al. 1988) a second mutation, a silent C-O'T transition at NT 1311 was present. More recently, we have found the same mutation in the DNA of all five patients whom we have examined with G6PD Mediterranean (Vives-Corrons et al. 1990). We have now investigated the distribution of this mutation in patients with and without G6PD deficiency, and we have concluded that it represents a relatively common polymorphism. Its existence in the vast majority of European subjects with G6PD Mediterranean suggests that this mutation may have arisen only once in the Mediterranean basin, but its absence from Indian-subcontinent subjects with G6PD Mediterranean suggests that it occurred independently there.  NT 1311 Polymorphism of G6PD  1009  Table I NT 1311 in 24 Male Subjects with C-T at NT 563  Population Origin  No. of Patients  Designation  NT 1311  Reference  Iran ........ ........

Detection of the G6PD C-T Mutation at NT 1311 Because the mutation at NT 1311 does not produce or destroy a restriction site, the identity of the NT at this position was initially determined by sequence analysis of exon 11. Single-stranded DNA containing this exon was produced in two stages by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR reaction contained 34 mM Tris-HC1 pH 8.8, 8.3 mM ammonium sulfate, 3.4 mM MgCl2, 85 ig BSA/ml, 0.5 mM of each dNTP, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, 1 gg genomic DNA, 5 units Taq polymerase, and 50 ng each of the oligonucleotides 5'-ACTCCACATGGTGCAGGCAG and 3Y-TAACTGGAGTCGACGTGTAA. After 15 cycles consisting of 30 s at 921C, 30 s at 580C, and 30 s at 720C, 300 ng of a nested oligonucleotide of the sequence 5'-TGGCATCAGCAAGACACTCT was added for an additional 35 cycles. After phenol/chloroform extraction, chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation (Maniatis et al. 1982), the PCR DNA was purified by spin dialysis and was sequenced using a commercially available Taq polymerase sequencing kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The sequencing oligonucleotide 3'-GGACGTATGGACACCCGATA was radiolabeled with y-32P-ATP and polynucleotide kinase (Maniatis et al. 1982). In order to screen larger numbers of samples the technique of allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was used. One microgram of genomic DNA was amplified by the PCR to obtain a 148-bp fragment of DNA containing exon 11 by using 5'-TGGCATCAGCAAGACACTCT and 3'-GGACGTATGGACACCCGATA as primers. Thirty cycles of amplification were carried out by using 250 ng of each oligonucleotide in a 100-gl system containing 34 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.8, 8.3 mM ammonium sulfate, 3.4 mM MgCl2, 85 ig BSA/ml, 0.5 mM of each dNTP, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 3 units Taq polymerase. The reaction mixture was extracted with phenol/chloroform and was ethanol precipitated (Maniatis et al. 1982). DNA was recovered by centrifugation, lyophilization, and redissolving the precipitate in 30-50 gl of water. Two microliters of the amplified DNA was spotted on two wetted nitrocellulose membranes, along with a normal sample and a mutant sample. The membranes were soaked for 2 min in 1.5 M NaCl and 0.5 M NaOH, for 5 min in 1.5 M NaCl and O.S M Tris pH 8.0, and for 30 s in 0.2 M Tris pH 7.5 and 2 x SSC (Maniatis et al. 1982). They were then dried in a vacuum oven at 800C for  45 min. Oligonucleotides matching the normal (5'AGGCGCTCGTAGGCGTC) and mutant (5'-AGGCGCTCATAGGCGTC) sequence, with the mutation site in the center, were radioactively labeled with polynudeotide kinase and y-32P-ATP (Maniatis et al. 1982). The nitrocellulose papers were incubated in a heat-sealed bag with Pre-Hyb solution (6 x SSC, 5 x Denhardt's solution, 0.02 M sodium phosphate pH 7, 0.5 mg salmon sperm DNA/ml, and 1% SDS) for 30-60 min. The Pre-Hyb was removed, and 1.5 ml of Hyb solution (7 x SSC, 0.02 M sodium phosphate, pH 7, 0.5 mg salmon sperm DNA/ml, and 1% SDS) containing 10 x 106 cpm of labeled oligonucleotide was added, and the mixture was resealed and allowed to hybridize overnight at 420C. The membranes were then washed with 6 x SSC and 0.1% SDS, beginning 100C below the calculated melting temperature of 560C (mutant) and 58°C (normal), raising the temperature, and monitoring with a Geiger counter until the negative control DNA spots for each oligonucleotide were no longer radioactive, but the positive DNA spots still gave a good signal. The membranes were dried and subjected to ra-  dioautography. Results  Detection of the 1311 Mutation As shown in figure 1, the C-*T transition at NT 1311 could readily be detected by sequence analysis of DNA amplified directly from genomic DNA by PCR. Not  only could male hemizygotes for the wild type (C) and the mutant type (T) be distinguished readily, but female heterozygotes were easily detected. The same results could be obtained with less effort by using allelespecific oligonucleotide hybridization, as shown in figure 2. Incidence of the 1311 Mutation in Subjects with G6PD MediterraneanS63T Table 1 presents the result of screening of males from various ethnic origins whose DNA had been found to manifest the NT 563 C--T transition that is typical of G6PD Mediterranean. Also shown are the results that others obtained in the sequencing of Italian and  Sardinian G6PD-deficient samples.

Because the sequence is that of the antisense strand, a G is found in normals and an A is found in the mutant. NT 1311 is surrounded by a dotted line. Only normal alleles were detected in samples 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9. Samples 3, 5, and 8 are from heterozygous females. The appearance of the mutant hemizygote is shown in the right-most panel.  Both males and females were screened, and the results are therefore expressed as the number of X chromosomes with T at NT 1311. The G6PD status of many of these samples was unknown, and therefore no effort was made to exclude G6PD-deficient samples; however, since the incidence of the G6PD deficiency was less than 20% in all of these populations the bias introduced by including G6PD-deficient samples would not be very great.

Discussion  Previously reported nondeficiency polymorphisms in the G6PD gene appear to be limited to African populations (D'Urso et al. 1988; Fey et al. 1990). It is evident that NT 1311 of the G6PD cDNA is the site of a polymorphism that is more broadly represented in human populations. Similar frequencies were found in northern Europeans, Mediterranean populations, and Africans. Among Asian Indians almost one-half of the X chromosomes studied had a T at NT 1311. In contrast, the mutation was uncommon among X chromosomes of Orientals. The relatively low number of 1311T genes found in the Central/South American population, largely consisting of Mexicans, may reflect the Oriental origin of the American Indian. The existence of a mutation at NT 1311 was first found when DNA from subjects with G6PD Mediterranean were sequenced (De Vita et al. 1989). This silent mutation was found in addition to the mutation at NT 563. Both examination of eight additional samples from persons of Mediterranean origin who have the mutation at NT 563 and review of 14 cases reported earlier have revealed that all but one of these (Vulliamy et al. 1988) have the mutation at NT 1311 in addition. In contrast, both subjects from the Indian subcontinent who had the mutation at NT 563 (one of them had been reported earlier under the name "G6PD Birmingham" [Prchal et al. 1980]) had the normal C at NT 1311. These findings suggest that the mutation that causes G6PD Mediterranean may have occurred independently in Asia and in Europe. The single exception among 22 subjects to the linkage of 563T and 1311T could represent the result of either a crossover or population admixture.  1012  Acknowledgments We are grateful to Dr. S. K.

FRIEND*  Familial cancer syndromes have helped to define the role of tumor suppressor genes in the development of cancer. The dominantly inherited Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is of particular interest because of the diversity of childhood and adult tumors that occur in affected individuals. The rarity and high mortality of LFS precluded formal linkage analysis. The alternative approach was to select the most plausible candidate gene. The tumor suppressor gene, p53, was studied because of previous indications that this gene is inactivated in the sporadic (nonfamilial) forms of most cancers that are associated with LFS. Germ line p53 mutations have been detected in all five LFS families analyzed. These mutations do not produce amounts of mutant p53 protein expected to exert a trans-dominant loss of function effect on wild-type p53 protein. The frequency of germ line p53 mutations can now be examined in additional families with LFS, and in other cancer patients and families with clinical features that might be attributed to the mutation. IN 1969, LI AND FRAUMENI REVIEWED MEDICAL RECORDS  and death certificates of 648 childhood rhabdomyosarcoma patients and identified four families in which siblings or cousins had a childhood sarcoma (1). These four families also had striking histories of breast cancer and other neoplasms, suggesting a new familial cancer syndrome of diverse tumors (Li-Fraumeni syndrome; LFS). Recently completed prospective studies have confirmed the 30 NOVEMBER 1990  high risk in family members of the tumor types that comprise LFS (2). Since the original description of the syndrome, systematic studies and anecdotal reports have confirmed its existence in various geographic and ethnic groups (3). The spectrum of cancers in the syndrome (Table 1) has been determined to include breast carcinomas, soft tissue sarcomas, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, leukemia, and adrenocortical carcinoma. Possible component tumors of LFS are melanoma, gonadal germ cell tumors, and carcinomas of the lung, pancreas, and prostate (4, 5). These diverse tumor types in family members characteristically develop at unusually early ages, and multiple primary tumors are frequent. To test the hypothesis that the Li-Fraumeni syndrome has a genetic etiology, Williams and Strong (5) applied segregation analysis and demonstrated that the observed cancer distribution in families best fit a rare autosomal dominant gene model. This model also predicted that the probability, for the families at risk, of developing any invasive cancer (excluding carcinomas of the skin) D. Malkin, C. E. Nclson, D. H. Kim, J. Kassel, M. A.

However, since the reversion rate in retroviral replication of such a 4-bp insertion is lower than 1l-7 per insertion (5), this explanation is unlikely. Different markers in the two U5 regions may also result from mismatch repair of either the 5' US or the 3' U5 region. If the 5' U5 region experienced the repair and resulted in a different marker than the 3' US region, then the minus strand transfer had to be intermolecular (from WH204 RNA to WH13 RNA) to form the 3' LTR. Suppose the minus strand strong stop DNA synthesis of WH13 RNA never initiated. As a result uS and pbs were intact. Then it was possible for the minus strand DNA synthesis to continue and copy the US marker of WH13 (Bam HI). After completion of DNA synthesis and repair, the Bam HI marker remained in the 5' U5 and resulted in different markers in the two US regions. It is also possible that the 3' US region was repaired to a different marker. Then the minus strand strong stop transfer had to be intramolecular (from WH13 to WH13) to result in the 5' WH13-likc LTR. Suppose a strand displacement event occurred at the end of the 3' LTR and formed a mismatch at the 3' US: the minus strand DNA contained a Barn HI site and the plus strand contained a Cla I site from the displaced fragment. After repair, the CIa I marker remained and resulted in the two  FEMALE WTrH CANCER, DECEASED  U  MALE, NO CANCER  5 PERSONS OF ErTHER SEX  8  11 248  GERMINE MUTATION AT OF ONE p53 ALLELE  wt  WLD-TYPE p53 ALLELE  CODON  14 III  248/-  LOSS OF WLD ALLELE IN TUMOR  248/wt  248/vt  FAMLY 1  FAMLY 2  Fig. 1.

More than 90 percent of the gene carriers would develop cancer by age 70. While the syndrome has thus been characterized statistically, identification of the gene and the mechanisms for the striking cancer predisposition has been elusive. Difficulties in cloning the LFS gene arose from a number of restrictions placed on traditional methods. The accumulation of informative tissue specimens and data has been hampered by the rarity of the syndrome, by the high mortality among affected individuals, and by lack of an unambiguous definition of the syndrome. In addition, the cancers in relatives without the gene often cannot be distinguished from cancers associated with the gene. Linkage studies and searches for constitutional karyotypic alterations in patients with LFS have failed to specify the chromosomal region on which to focus. Furthermore, these families do not have any precancerous conditions or associated malformation syndromes such as aniridia, which was useful in mapping the Wilms tumor gene (WT1) to chromosome 'lp3 (7). Because of these difficulties, we targeted potential candidate genes for study. The class of genes most strongly associated with familial tumors has been the tumor suppressor genes. The first tumor suppressor gene to be cloned, the retinoblastoma gene (Rb) (8), seemed an unlikely candidate for a germ line mutation in LFS because retinoblastoma has not been observed in these families. The second tumor suppressor gene to be recognized was p53, located on the short arm of chromosome 17, band p13 (9). Inactivating mutations of p53 have been associated with sporadic osteosarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas, brain tumors, leukemias, and carcinomas of the lung and breast (10, 11). Together, these tumors also account for more than half of  the cancers in selected series of LFS families. Furthermore, transgenic mice carrying a mutant p53 gene have an increased incidence of osteosarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas, adenocarcinomas ofthe lung, and adrenal and lymphoid tumors (12). These tumors all have been noted in families with LFS. We therefore decided to test whether families with LFS carry germ line p53 gene mutations. Germ line p53 gene mutations in LFS families. Skin biopsies were obtained from three affected and five unaffected relatives in family 1 (see Fig. 1). Their fibroblasts were grown in short-term culture, and DNA was extracted by standard techniques (13). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the genomic region encoding exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene (14). This segment contains a majority of the conserved domains and most of the mutations found in sporadic tumors (10, 15). The primers used for amplification were designed to contain Eco RI sites at their 5' ends so that the 1685-bp amplified fragment could be subcloned for sequencing. Multiple primers were then used to sequence the entire genomic region on both strands (16). Each sequencing reaction was repeated on multiple clones. Three members in family 1 (II-1, II-4, and II-6) have the wild-type p53 sequence in six out of six clones (Table 2). These individuals are considered to carry two wild-type p53 alleles and have no evidence of tumors. DNA from separate clones representing the five other family members contained both wild-type p53, and p53 with a C to T mutation at the first nucleotide of codon 248. These individuals are considered to carry both a wild-type and a mutant p53 allele in their fibroblasts. Even though several polymorphisms have been identified in the p53 gene (17), none has been detected in the five conserved domains (10, 11, 15, 18). These findings are derived from the sequencing of the p53 gene in more than 150 samples of the DNA extracted from  3  1234  1  3  2148/vt  FAMLY 4  252/vst  FAMLY 5  SCIENCE, VOL. 250  Downloaded from www.sciencemag.org on June 14, 2012  drome.

The region in which all observed mutations occurred is shown. The boxed-in segment from codons 234 to 258, inclusive, identifies conserved region IV (15). Each panel demonstrates the particular point mutation within the codon relative to its position within the rest of the surrounding sequence; wt refers to the wild-type done sequenced, and "mutP refers to the mutant done sequenced. The sequences are read from bottom to top. The letter within a circle identifies the amino acid to which the corresponding wild-type amino acid is switched as a result of the base-pair change. In each of these samples, no other p53 gene mutations were identified. It should be noted that in codon 249, base-pair compression occurs causing two guanine residues to appear as one band. (B) Conformational changes incurred by the point mutation in codon 248 open up this compression, revealing the true wild-type configuration at 249. Sequencing of the reverse strand of the wild-type clones reveals the two expected distinct cytosine residues (29). Sequencing of both strands confirms the guanine-guanine compression at codon 249.

The codon 248 mutation, which changes an arginine to tryptophan, occurs within conserved region IV that spans codons 234 to 258 (boxed area, Fig. 2). It has been shown that it is not a polymorphism; in fact, it is the most common p53 mutation in sporadic tumors studied to date (10, 11, 18). The three affected individuals tested in this family have the codon 248 mutation. The unaffected grandfather (1-2) and his granddaughter (III-5) also carry the codon 248 mutation and are carriers predicted to be at high risk of developing cancer. Mutations in the p53 gene are documented to occur in the establishment of cells in long-term culture (19, 20). Thus, during in vitro passage of the LFS fibroblasts, the p53 gene might have acquired changes not present in the germ line. Although it is extremely unlikely that all five fibroblast lines acquired the codon 248 mutation, we collected blood from two of the individuals in this family (11-2 and 11-3) who have breast cancer and also one mutant p53 allele in their fibroblasts. DNA was extracted from their lymphocytes after four passages in tissue culture. Lymphocytes from both sisters have a C to T mutation at the first nucleotide of codon 248 (Table 2). This is the same mutation found in fibroblasts of these patients. To support the hypothesis that this p53 mutation represents a germ line mutation and not artifact ofPCR, we studied segregation of the p53 chromosome region in family 1. We used YNZ22.1, a highly polymorphic DNA sequence on chromosome 17p that  3:  ,  (D po  ~~~,  ~r  C\J  identifies variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) sequences (21). DNA from the eight members of family 1 was digested with Hinf I and, after DNA (Southern) blot transfer, was hybridized to the YNZ22.1 probe (22). Five polymorphisms for the YNZ22.1 allele were present in this family (Fig. 3). Alleles were numbered from 1 through 5 according to size. Five individuals whose constitutional DNA contains a mutant p53 gene all carry the YNZ22.1 allele No. 3 (Table 2). This demonstrates the co-segregation data confirm that co-segregation of this YNZ22.1 allele and the mutant gene in the family. The segregation data confirm members from three generations of family 1 have the identical germ line p53 gene mutation. We next examined four additional LFS families (Fig. 1, families 2 through 5) for germ line p53 gene mutations. In family 2, lymphocytes and a portion of the breast cancer were available from member 11-6. DNA encoding exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene was first amplified from the lymphocytes. Mutation of a G to an A at the first nucleotide of codon 258 was found in three of four clones. This results in a switch from a glutamic acid to a lysine at this residue. (Table 2 and Fig. 2). This mutation apparently has not been noted  polymorphism (10, 11, 18). All six clones containing DNA amplified from the breast cancer had the same mutation at codon 258 of the p53 gene. This suggests that a mutant p53 allele is present in this patient's constitutional cells, and that the breast cancer cells lost the remaining wild-type p53 allele. Because the DNA of this patient was uninformative for two p53 polymorphic markers and uninformative for the YNZ22. 1 allele, it is difficult to confirm that the cells in the breast tumor had no remaining wild-type p53 protein (20, 21). Osteosarcoma cells, normal tissue adjacent to the tumor, and skin fibroblasts were obtained from individual III-2 in family 3. Both the adjacent normal tissue and skin fibroblasts had a mutation of a C to a T at the first nucleotide of codon 245, which results in cysteine replacing the glycine at this position. The same mutation was found in three of four clones analyzed from the individual's osteosarcoma. In this case, the YNZ22.1 polymorphic probe was informative and showed a 70 percent reduction of one allele in the tumor sample. The partial loss ofthe wild-type allele is due to admixture of normal tissue in this sample (20). This suggests that individual 111-2 in family 3 has a germ line p53 mutation at codon 245, and that cells within the tumor lost the remaining wild-type p53 allele. Lymphocytes from individual III-3 in family 4 were analyzed for p53 gene mutations. Clones containing amplified DNA encoding p53 had the same C to T transition at the first nucleotide in codon 248 as found in family 1. The high frequency of codon 248 mutations in sporadic tumors and its presence in two ofthe five LFS families suggest a propensity to change at this site. Individual III- 1 in family 5 has a germ line mutation at codon 252. In the first position of this codon there is a T to C change, which results in proline replacing leucine at this position. All p53 germ line mutations noted in the LFS families are located in conserved region IV, where no polymorphisms have been detected and where nucleotide changes have previously been limited as a  Table 2.

Recently, an International Working Group on LFS was established, and nearly 100 candidate families have been enrolled. Members of these families can be examined for germ line p53 mutations. This effort should help clarify the spectrum of cancers attributable to germ line p53 gene alterations. In addition, gene carriers will be identified among the unaffected children and older relatives. A determination can also be made of the family members who are in fact, not carriers. The ability to detect germ line p53 mutations creates a responsibility to properly use this information, and to develop strategies for the care of gene carriers at exceptionally high risk of cancer. The frequency of individuals in the general population who carry germ line p53 mutations is undefined. Li-Fraumeni syndrome might identify only the rare families in which germ line mutations in the p53 gene are highly penetrant and expressed in multiple tissues. The role of p53 germ line mutations in human cancer cannot be fully addressed by assessing its role in familial cancer. In retinoblastoma, for example, 85 percent of germ line mutation carriers, as identified by the presence of bilateral tumors, occur de novo (28). A germ line p53 mutation could occur in a substantial population of children and young adults who die of the cancer and do not propagate the gene. We are therefore seeking p53 mutations in individuals and families who display one or more features of LFS, such as multiple primary cancers or breast cancer in several young relatives. Those with a germ line p53 gene mutation are enrolled in a multicenter registry for further analyses. In conclusion, we have shown that alterations of the p53 gene occur not only as somatic mutations in human cancers, but also as germ line mutations in some cancer-prone families. The frequency of germ line p53 mutations in cancer patients in the general population is unknown and merits further study. Both somatic and germ line mutations also arise in another tumor suppressor gene, the retinoblastoma gene. These finding indicate that the search for additional tumor suppressor genes can proceed along two parallel research A  Fibroblasts u)  r-  _  B  0  o  co c\  Z 3:  39 9  cn Fibroblasts  | m  N  O  N  I  _  -  -2.

All the mutations described in Table 2 were confirmed by a second PCR reaction and resequencing the gene products. Performing the PCR reactions in duplicate allowed us to overcome the inconsistencies due to the 0.25 percent rate of base misincorporation documented by others and previously confirmed in our laboratory (10, 23). Germ line p53 mutations were not identified in seven healthy controls and seven individuals with sporadic tumors who had no family history of cancer. Possibility of restictions on germ line p53 mutations. The half-lives of most mutant p53 proteins are markedly increased in comparison to the half-life of wild-type p53 protein. This is primarily a result of a complex they form with the heat shock proteins (hsc-70) (24). These mutant p53 proteins attain levels comparable to those known to exert a "trans-dominant loss of function" effect on wild-type p53 (23, 25). Other rare mutant p53 proteins that fail to form a complex with hsc-70 have a reduced capacity to override wild-type p53 function in transformation assays (26). We therefore asked whether such a trans-dominant loss of function effect of some mutant p53 proteins would restrict the types of germ line p53 mutations found in LFS families. The level of p53 protein was analyzed by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates from normal fibroblasts, LFS fibroblasts, and KHOS-240S cells (Fig. 4). The latter contain a p53 mutation at codon 156. This mutant protein forms a complex with hsc-70 (27). The high level of p53 protein found in the KHOS-240S cells is representative of the large amounts of protein found in cells with mutant p53 protein that complexes the hsc-70 proteins (25). In contrast, the p53 protein levels in the three LFS fibroblast lines are comparable to those of wild-type p53. The level of p53 protein in fibroblasts from individuals of 12 LFS families (including the four with documented germ line p53 mutations analyzed in Fig. 4), were also tested by immunofluorescence studies. All had low fluorescent intensities comparable to cells containing wild-type p53 protein (20). Both the immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies probably indicate a selection against the p53 gene mutations that stabilize the mutant p53 protein that exerts a trans-dominant loss of function effect on the wild-type protein. Screening tests to determine germ line p53 mutations should not rely on methods that assume that the mutations will result in high levels of mutant protein. Interpreations of the data. The presence of p53 mutations in the sporadic forms of many human tumors suggests that these alterations are an important step in the transformation of diverse cells. All cells in the individuals with LFS that we studied presumably have a single wild-type p53 allele. This finding provides an opportunity to compare the effects of p53 inactivation on the development of cancer in different tissues. The most remarkable feature of this syndrome is the diversity of tumors in the gene carriers. This suggests that numerous tissues are rendered more susceptible to transformation when they have only one wild-type p53 allele. The inactivation of p53 must therefore be at least one of the rate-limiting steps in the transformation of many tissues. However, tumors in LFS are not evenly distributed by site and do not follow cancer frequency patterns in the general population (Table 1). For example, breast carcinoma and colon carcinoma have comparable frequencies in the general population, and frequently have associated p53 mutations (6). In the LFS families, breast cancer occurs much more frequently than colon carcinoma (Table 1). The difference suggests that p53 inactivation is a more critical ratelimiting step in breast carcinoma formation than it is in colon carcinoma formation. Other patterns of tumor frequencies among affected individuals with LFS can provide additional clues regarding the differences in tissue-specific growth control pathways. The development of molecular diagnostic tests to identify carriers of germ line p53 mutations provides a new tool for screening  REFERENCES AND NOTES  1. F. P. Li, and 1. F. Fraumeni, Jr., Ann.

"1","In a family expressing euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia, an increased association of plasma thyroxine (T4) with transthyretin (TTR) is transmitted by autosomal dominant inheritance and is secondary to a mutant TTR molecule with increased affinity for T4. Eight individuals spanning three generations exhibited the abnormality. Although five of eight individuals had elevated total T4 concentrations, all affected individuals were clinically euthyroid and all had normal free T4 levels. Purified TTR from the propositus had an affinity for 125I-T4 three times that of control TTR. Exons 2, 3, and 4 (representing greater than 97% of the coding sequence) of the TTR gene of DNA prepared from the propositus' peripheral blood leukocytes were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were sequenced after subcloning. Exons 2 and 3 were indistinguishable from normal. In 50% of clones amplified from exon 4, a substitution of adenine (ACC) for guanine (GCC) in codon 109 resulted in the replacement of threonine-for-alanine, a mutation confirmed by amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides derived from purified plasma TTR. The adenine-for-guanine substitution abolishes one of two Fnu 4H I restriction sites in exon 4. PCR amplification of exon 4 of TTR and restriction digestion with Fnu 4H I confirmed that five affected family members with increased binding of 125I-T4 to TTR are heterozygous for the threonine 109 substitution that increases the affinity of this abnormal TTR for T4.A point mutation in transthyretin increases affinity for thyroxine and produces euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia.A Point Mutation in Transthyretin Increases Affinity for Thyroxine and Produces Euthyroid Hyperthyroxinemia Alan C.

PCR amplification of exon 4 of TT7R and restriction digestion with Fnu 4H I confirmed that five affected family members with increased binding of 25.I-T4 to TMR are heterozygous for the threonine 109 substitution that increases the affinity of this abnormal TIR for T4.

These subjects are often incorrectly diagnosed, and subjected to unnecessary laboratory tests and inappropriate therapy (1). Several investigators have demonstrated increased total T4 in clinically euthyroid subjects who have marked elevations of circulating transthyretin (2-4). In 1982, we reported a patient with euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia and suggested that the elevated serum T4 resulted from an abnormal TTR with increased affinity for T4 rather than from an elevated concentration of TTR. Lalloz et al. (5, 6) and Croxson et al. (7) have reported other patients with a similar abnormality. In this report, we have investigated in greater detail the mechanisms underlying the hyperthyroxinemia in the kindred reported by us and describe a point mutation in the TTR gene that appears to be responsible for the greater affinity of this molecule for T4.  Methods General hormone and protein assays. Total T4 (Corning Medical, Medfield, MA), T3 resin uptake (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL), total T3 (Clinical Assays, Cambridge, MA), and thyroxine binding globulin (TBG, Corning Medical) were measured using standard commercially available kits. Free T4 was measured both by dialysis and by a two-step direct immunoassay procedure (Clinical Assays). TTR concentrations in serum were measured by rocket immunoelectrophoresis (1). Comparisons between groups were performed by the Student's unpaired t test and statistical significance was arbitrarily defined at P < 0.05. Statistical significance of differences between the affinity of mutant TTR and normal TTR was determined by the Mann-Whitney test.  Protein binding and sequencing studies. 27 relatives of the proband were screened for an increase in T4 associated with TTR by three assays: (a) T4 immunoprecipitation by anti-TTR IgG, (b) a modified T4-loaded T4 charcoal-uptake test (8), and (c) serum paper electrophoresis after incubation of sera with '251I-T4 (1). Sera from these subjects were also compared with sera from six normal unrelated subjects aged 25-50 yr. For the immunoprecipitation assay, 100 ,d of a 1:25 dilution of sera in PBS were incubated with 1251-T4 (6 X 10-12 M; SA 4,400 Ci/mmol New England Nuclear, Boston, MA) in 100 Al of PBS containing 100 Mg/ml of BSA for 3 h at 37°C. 100 ,d of a 1:20 dilution of anti-TTR IgG (Atlantic Antibodies, Scarborough, ME) were added before incubation overnight at 4°C. The TTR-IgG complex was precipitated in the presence of 0.1% bovine gamma globulin and 10% (wt/vol, final concentration) 8,000 mol wt polyethylene glycol (PEG) for 30 min at 4°C and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for an additional 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was counted in a gamma spectrometer. Data were expressed as a percent of total counts precipitated by anti-TTR. All samples were measured in duplicate in at least three separate assays. The T4-loaded T4 charcoal-uptake test was performed using a modification of the method of Stockigt et al. (8). In this assay, 1O Al of sera was incubated with 125I-T4 in the presence of 1-0 unlabeled T4, an Mutant Transthyretin Causing Hyperthyroxinemia  2025  amount sufficient to saturate the high affinity, low capacity T4 binding site on TBG. Samples were incubated for I h at 23°C in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% gelatin before mixing with 0.5 ml of chilled 1% Norit A charcoal/0.4% Dextran 70. Charcoal-bound '25I-T4 was separated by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatants containing the protein-bound '25I-T4 were counted for 1251I. This represents '25I-T4 bound to TTR and albumin. The electrophoretic distribution of 1251-T4 in sera was measured by filter paper electrophoresis in a Tris-maleate buffer, pH 8.6, as described previously (1). 5-mm strips of paper were cut beginning at the origin and counted for 1251. Data were expressed as a percentage of total recovered counts associated with TBG, albumin, and TTR, respec-  tively. TTR purification, competitive binding studies, and protein sequencing. TTR was purified by three-step column chromatography as described previously (9). TTR affinity for thyroxine was assessed with a competitive binding assay using both whole sera (1:25 dilution in PBS) and purified TTR (0.5 ,ug/tube), as described above for the immunoprecipitation studies except that replicate samples of sera or purified TTR were incubated with '251-T4 (6 x 10-12 M) in the presence of varying concentrations of unlabeled T4. Previous studies (data not presented) demonstrated that the incubation conditions resulted in steady-state binding of '25I-T4 to TTR. TTR-bound '25I-T4 was separated as described above for the immunoprecipitation assay and counted in a gamma spectrometer. Affinity constants were calculated by the method of Scatchard (10). All assays were performed at least three times. Purified TTR (3 mg) was digested overnight with 2% trypsin (wt/ wt), and the resulting peptides were isolated using reverse-phase HPLC. Specific purified tryptic peptides were sequenced in a liquidphase protein sequenator, as previously described (1 1). Peptides for sequencing were selected based on DNA sequencing of exon 4 as described below. Enzymatic amplification of genomic DNA and DNA sequencing. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes by phenol/chloroform extraction using standard techniques (12). The TTR gene consists of four exons encoding a protein monomer of 127 amino acids and 14,000 mol wt (13, 14). Exons 2, 3, and 4 of the TTR gene encode > 97% of the amino acid sequence and were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with three oligonucleotide primer sets as previously described ( 11) and producing PCR products of 215, 258, and 190 bp, respectively. Exon 1 which encodes only the first three amino-terminal amino acids was not studied (13, 14). Each oligonucleotide primer contained a PST- 1 restriction enzyme recognition site that was used for subsequent subcloning (15). PCR product DNA fragments were visualized after agarose gel electrophoresis (1.8% agarose) in the presence of ethidium bromide. Appropriate length fragments were excised from the gel, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and ethanol precipitated. They were digested with PSTI and ligated into MP-18RF DNA with T4 DNA ligase (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) (15). These constructs were used to transform competent JMIOI Escherichia coli (15). Single-stranded DNA was isolated from 8 clones derived from exon 2, 10 clones from exon 3, and 8 clones from exon 4. The DNA was sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method with modified T7 DNA polymerase (16) (Sequenase Version 2.0; U.S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). Screening family members for mutations in the TTR gene using PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). A point mutation present in four of eight M- 13 colonies of exon 4 from the proband eliminated one of two restriction sites for the enzyme Fnu 4H I in exon 4. Based on this observation, we isolated genomic DNA from additional members of the proband's family and subjected the DNA to PCR amplification of exon 4 with the following oligonucleotide primers (see also Fig. 8): 5' oligo: 5' TAG GTG GTA TTC ACA GCC 3' 3' oligo: 5' GTG CCT TTC ACA GGA ATG 3' 2026  Moses et al.  These PCR reactions were performed with Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT) for 40 cycles. Denaturation was accomplished at 90°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 60 s, and extension at 70°C for 60 s, except during the last cycle where the extension time was 7 min. Aliquots of the amplified PCR product DNA (100 ng) were digested with 1.5 U of the restriction enzyme Fnu 4H I (New England Biolabs, Beverly MA), and subjected to electrophoresis in 4% agarose gels (Nusieve; FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME). The bands were visualized with ethidium bromide staining and photographed. The mutation predicts fragments of 222 and 35 bp as opposed to 207-, 15-, and 35-bp fragments for the normal gene. Heterozygotes, therefore, are expected to display both 207- and 222-bp fragments (the smaller fragments usually are not visualized using this technique).  Results  Studies offamily members. Of 27 family members screened, 8 demonstrated increased precipitation of 1251I-T4 by anti-TTR IgG compared with six normal controls (27.0±4.8% vs. 5.78±2.0%, respectively, P < 0.0001; Fig. 1). Affected family members were defined as those in whom the 125I-T4 precipitated by anti-TTR IgG was more than 3 SD greater than the mean obtained in the six normal control subjects, which was 15%. There was no overlap between the affected individuals and the six control subjects. Moreover, there was no overlap between affected and unaffected family members and no difference between unaffected family members and controls  (Fig. 1).

There was a corresponding decrease in the amount of '25I-T4 associated with TBG in the affected (29±6.8%) versus the unaffected (43.8±4.9%) family members (data not shown). We confirmed that the concentration of TTR was not significantly increased in the affected individuals (39.5±17 mg/dl [affected] vs. 31.7±9.9 mg/dl [unaffected]; Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, there was no correlation between the individual TTR concentrations and '25I-T4 precipitated by anti-TTR IgG (Fig. 3). Serum TBG levels were identical (19.3 mg/liter, Fig. 2) in both the affected and unaffected groups of family members. Serum T4 was significantly higher in affected than in unaffected family members (12.5±1.7 vs 9.2±3.2 jg/dl respectively, P = 0.0009), as was the free T4 index (11.8±2.6 vs 7.76±2.2, respectively, P = 0.0002; Fig. 4). Five of the eight affected patients had serum T4 levels above the upper limit of the normal range (12 Ag/dl), although there was considerable overlap between the two groups. Free T4 by equilibrium dialysis and by a two-step direct free T4 assay was normal in all affected subjects. There was no significant difference in serum T3 levels between affected (135±21 ng/dl) and unaffected subjects (127±22 ng/dl). The latter finding is not unexpected given the low affinity of TTR for T3. We have used the data from immunoprecipitation of 125IT4 with anti-TTR IgG to investigate the mode ofinheritance of this cause of euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia. As shown in Fig. 5, TTR-associated hyperthyroxinemia was identified in two generations and was transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. These data suggest that affected individuals are heterozygous from a presumed mutation in the TTR gene.

Since this concentration of unlabeled T4 (1-' M) should saturate all available TBG binding sites (Ka = 109/M), these findings are consistent with affected individuals having an increased association of T4 with TTR or with albumin.

Ident'ification of a coding region mutation in the proband's an  effort to identify  an  0  135  00 00 0 0  proband's TTR gene that could account for the increased affinity of this protein for T4, we performed DNA sequencing of TTR exons 2, 3, and 4 following PCR amplification of genomic DNA. Within exon 4, four of eight independent M-13 clones revealed an adenine-for-guanine substitution in the position corresponding to the first base of the triplet codon for amino acid residue 109 (Fig. 7). This finding is consistent with a heterozygous defect which is present in half of the alleles. This mutation encodes threonine (ACC) at this position instead of alanine (GCC) found in normal TTR. The DNA sequence of 8 clones isolated from exon 2 and 10 clones from exon 3 failed to detect any consistent changes from the reported normal TTR cDNA sequence. We did not amplify exon 1, which encodes only the first three amino terminal residues of TTR (13, 14). Direct amino acid sequencing of HPLC-purified tryptic peptides ofthe propsitus's TTR confirmed a threonine-for-alanine substitution at this location and also confirmed the heterozygous nature of the mutation (Fig. 8). HPLC separation of tryptic peptides generated from the propositus' TTR revealed a peak (11- 12*, Fig. 8) not found in wild-type TTR. Amino acid sequence analysis of this peptide (residues 104-114) revealed a sequence of Arg-Tyr-Thr-Ile-Ala-Thr-Leu-Leu-Ser-  Parallel studies were performed on whole sera from affected and unaffected family members and the results with whole sera were similar to those obtained with purified TTR (data not shown).

The lack of correlation between TTR concentration and 125I-T4 precipitated by anti-TTR IgG suggests that hyperthyroxinemia in these subjects is due to a TTR with increased affinity for T4. To confirm this suggestion, we performed equilibrium competitive binding studies with 125I-T4 and anti-TTR IgG on TTR purified from the proband's plasma and from the plasma of a normal control subject (Fig. 6). As is apparent from the left panel in Fig. 6, the most striking difference between "affected" and normal TTR was the amount of '25I-T4 bound in the absence of unlabeled T4. Scatchard analysis of competitive binding studies comparing purified TTR from the proband to TTR from a normal control revealed that the proband's TTR bound T4 with an affinity approximately three times that of control (Ka = 3.36±.76 [n =  n a 19  Figure 4.

The HPLC chromatogram also contained a peptide 1 1-12' found in wild-type TTR which on sequencing revealed alanine at position 109. Thus, a single heterozygous threonine-for-alanine substitution at position 109 of TTR is associated with an increased affinity of this protein for T4 and appears to account for the clinical syndrome of euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia in this kindred. The adenine-for-guanine substitution in the mutant TTR DNA should abolish one of two cleavage sites for the restriction endonuclease Fnu 4H I in exon 4 (Fig. 9).

As seen in Figs. 8 and 9, when visualized after agarose gel electrophoresis, the largest of these fragments are 222 and 207 bp for the mutant and normal alleles, respectively. To verify that each family member who demonstrated increased binding of '251I-T4 to TTR had the predicted mutation, we subjected DNA from the proband, four additional affected family members, one unaffected relative, and three normal controls to RFLP analysis of amplified exon 4 as detailed in Methods. The results of three affected family members (including the son of the propositus [individual III 2, Fig. 5]), one control, and one unaffected family member are shown in Fig. 10. Based on this analysis, five of five of the individuals predicted to have a threonine-for-alanine substitution have this substitution and none of the unaffected individuals display the loss ofthe Fnu 4H I site. Each affected individual also appears to be a heterozygote since both the 222- and 207-bp bands were present after Fnu 4H I digestion (Fig. 9).  Discussion Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia is a relatively common clinical condition. Most often, elevated serum thyroxine levels are due to increased levels of TBG, but this situation usually is recognized easily due to the presence of a low T3RU or high TBG level, either of which are part of the routine assessment of Mutant Transthyretin Causing Hyperthyroxinemia  2029  Figure 8.

Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia associated with a normal T3RU is an uncommon condition caused either by increased T4 binding to albumin, transthyretin, or gamma globulin (8). These situations can present diagnostic dilemmas since the elevated total T4 and normal T3RU result in an increased free T4 index consistent with thyrotoxicosis. Measured free T4 and TSH should be normal. Most patients with this condition have increased binding to albumin, due to a variant albumin with an increased affinity for T4 (17-19). The molecular basis of the increased affinity of albumin for T4 is unresolved (20). Increased binding of T4 to IgG most often is seen in the setting of autoimmune thyroid disease such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis (21). From the perspective of clinical management, the increasing availability of sensitive TSH assays to  from positions 104-114 and peptide 12'gave the normal transthyretin sequence from position 105-114. Peptides T9, T6, T4, T1O,andT7 were identified by their  assess suppression of TSH as an aid in the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis should decrease the likelihood ofinappropriate treatment of subjects with euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia due to abnormal or excess T4 binding proteins. Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia due to increased T4 binding to transthyretin is a rare cause of an uncommon condition and may result from an excess mass of normal transthyretin (2-4) or from a transthyretin molecule with an increased affinity for thyroxine (1, 5-7). Three reports of euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia due to elevated levels of TTR have been described (2-4); all cases were in patients with pancreatic endocrine tumors.

Exon 4 of genomic DNA was amplified with primer sets described in Fig. 8 and in Methods. The amplified cDNA (257 bp in length) was subjected to digestion with Fnu 4H I and the products were run on 4%  -207 bp  agarose, stained with ethidium bro-  -257 bp  mide, and photographed. Each sample was run in duplicate with the left lane (-) being in the absence of _ + _ + _ _ _ + __ Fnu 4H I and the right panel (+) in the presence of Fnu 4H I. (Lanes I and 2) Exon 4 amplified from two normal controls; (lanes 3-5) exon 4 amplified from three affected family members as defined by immunoprecipitation with anti-TTR IgG. Two additional affected family members gave results identical to those shown in lanes 3-5. The molecular size markers are 4X 174 RF DNA cut with HAE III and are in the left lane.  sured free T4, TSH, and T3 concentrations were normal, and the TTR concentrations were elevated strikingly (from 4 to 10 times normal). In one patient in whom TTR binding capacity and affinity were studied in whole sera subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, the maximal binding capacity for T4 was elevated, while the affinity for T4 was normal (4). Thus, it would seem that in these patients hyperthyroxinemia is due to increased binding of T4 to a markedly elevated level ofTTR with normal affinity for T4. In 1982 we presented a preliminary report of the first case of euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia due to a TTR with an apparent increased affinity for T4 (1). We described a patient with elevated serum T4 and FI4I but with a normal total serum T3, F[4, TSH, and TSH response to TRH. As measured by electrophoresis and immunoabsorption, this patient had an unusually high fraction of T4 associated with TTR. Though this patient's TTR concentration was slightly elevated (66 mg/dl), the patient's hyperthyroxinemia was thought to be unrelated to the increased TTR concentrations, because the T4 binding capacity of the serum TTR was normal, and the patient's son had a similar phenotype with a normal serum TTR concentration. At that time, we had no direct evidence that the patient's TTR had an increased affinity for T4 and we had not investigated the molecular basis of this abnormality. We now report results confirming an increased affinity of TTR for T4 and demonstrating a point mutation in the coding region of TTR DNA which probably accounts for this increased affinity and the mode of inheritance of this mutation. The use of anti-TTR IgG allowed us to isolate 125I-T4 bound to TTR from other thyroxine binding proteins in serum and served as a convenient means to identify affected individuals in the kindred. Affected family members were defined on the basis of the precipitation of 125I-T4 by anti-TTR IgG > 3 SDs above the mean for sera from six normal control subjects. 8 of 27 family members tested carried the mutant TTR gene based on this definition and as confirmed by a T4-loaded T4 charcoal-uptake test and by paper electrophoresis (on 7 of the 8 affected family members). It is interesting to note that only five of the eight affected family members had total T4 levels above the upper limit of normal. Each of the individuals tested demonstrated an increased affinity of TTR for T4 as assessed by competitive binding  assays using whole sera. For the proband, this affinity was three times greater than that of normal TTR and was confirmed with competitive binding studies performed with purified TTR. The available data support the concept that each affected individual is heterozygous for this mutation and that the mutation is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. None of the members ofthis kindred have been treated for thyrotoxicosis and none except the proband had evidence of a goiter. Based on the presence of a variant TTR molecule with increased affinity for thyroxine we propose that this syndrome be called euthyroid dystransthyretinemic hyperthyroxinemia. Since investigation into the molecular basis of the increased affinity of TTR for T4 not only can establish the molecular basis of euthyroid dystransthyretinemic hyperthyroxinemia but also can provide some further insight into the nature of the molecular interaction between T4 and TTR, we performed sequencing studies on both the TTR gene and protein in the proband of this kindred. DNA and protein sequencing both are consistent with a threonine-for-alanine substitution in amino acid residue 109 of TTR. This is due to an adenine-for-guanine substitution at the first base pair of the codon for amino acid residue 109 in exon 4 of the TTR gene. All five affected family members who were tested were heterozygous for this mutation based on RFLP analysis of PCR-amplified exon 4 of genomic DNA digested with the restriction enzyme Fnu 4H I. While absolute proof of the relationship between this threonine-for-alanine substitution will require direct testing of homozygous, recombinant TTRs, the lack of other detectable defects in the coding region of TTR makes it likely that this mutation is responsible for the increased affinity of TTR for T4. Others have reported similar cases of hyperthyroxinemia due to a TTR with increased affinity for thyroxine. One case of euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia due to an increased fraction of T4 associated with TTR as assessed by immunoprecipitation was reported by Croxson et al. (7). Since the patient had only a trivial elevation of his TTR concentration, Croxson et al. attributed the hyperthyroxinemia to an abnormal TTR with an increased affinity for thyroxine, though direct studies to verify this assumption were not undertaken. In 1984, Lalloz et al. (5) reported a patient with dystransthyretinemic hyperthyroxinemia with normal TTR concentrations. They were able to Mutant Transthyretin Causing Hyperthyroxinemia  2031  isolate this patient's TTR and show that it had an increased affinity for thyroxine and reverse T3 as determined by equilibrium dialysis. Subsequently, Lalloz et al. (6) reported a patient who had both dysalbuminemic and dystransthyretinemic hyperthyroxinemia. They were able to verify that both the patient's albumin and TTR had an increased affinity for thyroxine. In addition, they were able to show that these abnormalities were inherited independently in the patient's family as autosom;al dominant traits. Further studies on one of these dystransthyretinemic patients were reported in abstract form by Fitch et al. (22). In this patient, a heterozygous point mutation in exon 2 encodes a serine-for-glycine substitution at amino acid number 6 in the mature protein. These are not the only examples of mutant TTRs with altered affinity for thyroxine. Refetoff et al. (23) have examined the affinity of TTR for T4 in patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy secondary to defined mutations in TTR (23). While none of these mutant TTRs demonstrated increased affinity for T4, several demonstrated decreased affinity for T4. We have confirmed this finding and extended it to additional TTR mutants using the '25I-T4 equilibrium competitive binding assay (24). Thus, a range of point mutations in the TTR gene alter tl;e ability of TTR molecules to associate with one another (to produce amyloid) and to associate with thyroxine. Each of these different mutations provides further insight into the molecular association of TTR with thyroxine. It is interesting to speculate how mutation of Ala'09 to Thr 09 described here affects TTR's affinity for T4. Amino acid 109 is situated at a domain that could perturb thyroxine binding in several different ways. The 3' outer ring iodine of thyroxine is projected to associate with the backbone oxygen of Ala'09 (25, 26). It is not clear how the substitution of threonine for alanine at this position alters the association with thyroxine iodine. The methyl groups of Ala'08 and Leu0'° are thought to form part of the hydrophobic patch of the thyroxine binding site (25), and it is possible that a substitution in the amino acid between them might slightly alter the relationship of these amino acids and alter thyroxine binding. It also is possible that the hydroxyl side chain of Thr " participates directly in the binding of T4. Alternatively, Blake et al. (26) reported that Ala"0 forms hydrogen bonds with Lys,'5 a residue that interacts with the side chain carboxylate of T4. Thus, it also is possible that a threonine-for-alanine substitution at amino acid 109 might result in some alteration in the configuration of Lys"5 vis-a-vis T4. Clarification of the mechanism by which this mutation increases TTR's affinity for T4 will be possible with subsequent molecular modeling and crystallization of homozygous mutant TTR. Additional information also may come from binding studies with iodothyronine analogues. In the family described here, TTR has a threefold increased affinity for T4 compared with normal TTR. Yet, the affected individuals are heterozygous for the mutant and normal TTR. Normal TTR is a tetrameric protein comprised of four identical subunits. In the affected individuals, assuming that the mutation will not affect the association of normal and mutant monomers, we would predict that TTR in the circulation is heterogeneous and consists of molecules with varying proportions of normal and mutant monomers. Thus, in these studies we have measured T4 affinity to TTR molecules, the majority ofwhich (93.75% based on random association of TTR monomers) contain at least one normal monomer. It is possible that 2032  Moses et al.  TTR tetramers consisting of four mutant monomers have even a higher affinity for T4 than measured in our competitive binding assays. Direct determination of T4 affinity by homozygous mutant TTR will have to await recombinant expression of this protein and should provide additional clues about the molecular interaction between TTR and thyroxine and about the association of TTR monomers themselves.

"1","Case Report  Clinical Genetics 1990: 38: 469473  Diagnosis of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy in France F. SATIERI, W. C. NICHOLS * AND M. D. BENSON' 'Department of Internal Medicine and Cardiology, St Quentin Hospital, France and 'Department of Medicine and Medical Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, USA Two cases of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) in a French family are reported. Clinical onset was in the fifth and sixth decades with decreased sensation in the lower limbs followed by involvement of the upper extremities. Motor changes appeared later and evolved to restrict ambularion. Cardiac involvement with congestive heart failure and arrhythmias was the cause of death. DNA analysis was performed on ten members of this family. Restriction enzyme analysis of amplification products of exons 2, 3 and 4 of the prealbumin gene were negative for the methionine-30, alanine-60 and serine-84 mutations but positive for the tyrosine77 mutation. The tyrosine-77 prealbumin mutation was first described in a family from Illinois with origin in Germany. The discovery of the tyrosine-77 gene in the family from Picardy may help to determine the origin of this disease and tell us if one mutation has been spread around the world, as we suspect, with many kindreds having the methionine-30 gene, or whether there have been separate spontaneous mutational events, perhaps a peculiarity of this site in the prealbumin gene. Received 10 Ocrobcr 1989, revised 25 May, accepred for publicarion 23 June 1990 Key words: familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy; restriction analysis of amplified DNA; Tyr77 mutation.  Hereditary amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by high penetrance but late onset. The disease results from a progressive extracellular deposition of amyloid protein (mostly perivascular) in many organs and prominently in the peripheral nervous system (Benson & Wallace 1989). Four members of a family (three brothers and a cousin) were affected by familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) (Satier 1989). Two of them were evaluated clinically and the diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy. The two others were presumed to have the disease on the basis of clinical findings, but no biopsies were done. The family is French, and has been living  in Picardy for many generations. Genomic DNA of members of this family was analyzed to determine if this family has one of the known mutations of prealbumin associated with hereditary amyloidosis.  Case Reports Case  I  Mr. T... Jacques, a retired French policeman, was born in 1924 in Beaurevoir. All of his family live in Picardy. He had no medical illness until age 56 when he developed sexual impotence. Three years later, the patient had gait disturbances which gradually worsened. He also noted paresthesiae in his feet and  470  SATIER E T AL.  legs. Subsequently, weakness and sensory loss in the lower limbs resulted in falls. When admitted to the hospital, he weighed 76 kg and his height was 169 cm. His blood pressure was 130/70 mm Hg. His pulse was 90/min. Neurologically, there was muscle weakness distally in the lower and upper extremities. He was ataxic. The cranial nerves were normal. All deep reflexes were absent. Plantar reflexes were unresponsive. Sensory modalities were decreased in the distal portions of the extremities. Biopsies of muscle and of superficial peroneal nerve were nondiagnostic. The electromyogram (EMG) showed markedly decreased nerve conduction velocities. A head CT was normal. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was normal. The chest roentgenogram was within normal limits. The electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block. Tests for serum and urine monoclonal protein were negative.  Blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and urine analysis were normal. Serum chemistry revealed no abnormalities. Four years later at age 63, Mr. T... was admitted to the hospital for severe congestive heart failure. Echocardiography showed concentric hypertrophy of the right and left ventricles consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy. A rectal biopsy was negative for amyloid, but a muscle biopsy showed perivascular deposition of amyloid when stained with Congo red. Treatment with dimethylsulfoxide was started but discontinued because of development of hepatitis. One year later, Mr. T... was again admitted to the hospital for congestive heart failure. He suffered a cardiac arrest and was admitted to the intensive care unit. At that time, he had signs of severe congestive heart failure, periorbital purpura, complete paralysis of the lower and upper limbs, a loss in  Y  I  11  “1  0  presunnd amyloidostS  Fig. 1.

Cranial nerve functions were normal. In June 1989, at age 65, the patient died from cardiac arrhythmia. Case 2  Mr. T. Marcel was born in 1910. He was a cousin of Case 1 (Fig. 1). He gave a history of high blood pressure, moderate heart failure treated by Digoxin and peripheral neuropathy of unknown etiology. At age 72, Mr. T. Marcel was admitted to the hospital for congestive heart failure. He gave a history of paresthesiae in his extremities of 2 years’ duration and not walking for 1 month.

Fasciculations were noted in shoulder girdle muscles. Deep tendon reflexes were absent and plantar reflexes were unresponsive. The cranial nerves were normal. Light touch and temperature sensations were diminished in all extremities. There was an eschar on the right heel. His blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg; and his pulse 88/min. He weighed 77 kg. The electrocardiogram showed: decreased voltage, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular hypertrophy, a partial left bundle branch block and ventricular extrasystoles. Chest roentgenogram showed cardiac enlargement and bilateral pleural effusions. The electromyogram revealed neurogenic changes and decreased nerve conduction velocities. Echocardiography sevealed symmetric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Blood cell count and urine analysis were normal. A 24 h urine collection showed no increase in protein excretion. At age 73, after episodes of hematuria, bladder biopsies showed an endothelial carcinoma which was treated with resection and local chemotherapy. One year later, the patient was again admitted to hospital in a cachectic state. A skin biopsy from the abdominal wall showed deposition of amyloid. Funduscopic examination showed no vitreous opacity. The patient died a few months later of heart failure and electrolyte abnormalities caused by diarrhea. At autopsy, amyloid deposits were found in the digestive tract, heart, spleen, tongue and liver. Material and Methods  Amplification of Total Genomic D N A Approximately, 1 pg genomic DNA was amplified using a GeneAmp DNA amplification kit (Perkin Elmer Cetus) and one of two sets of 30 base primers flanking pre-  472  SATIER ET AL.  albumin gene regions containing either exon 2 or 3. The lengths of the amplified regions for exons 2 and 3 were 215 bp and 268 bp, respectively. All components, except the Taq polymerase, were added to a 500 p1 microcentrifuge tube, in a total volume of 100 p1. The mix was heated to 95" C for 5 min to denature any proteases which may have been isolated with the genomic DNA. Taq polymerase (2.5 units) was added, mineral oil (100 pl, Sigma) was layered over the top and 30 cycles of amplification were performed using a Perkin Elmer DNA Thermar Cycler. Amplification conditions were 1 min of denaturing at 95"C, 2 min of annealing at 65°C and 3 min of elongation at 72°C. The last elongation step was performed for 8 min. After amplification, the samples were extracted 1X with Sevag (241 Ch:oroform: isoamyl alcohol) to remove the aqueous from the oil and then extracted 1X aach with TE-saturated phenol and Sevag. Amplification products were precipitated with 10 M ammonium acetate and 100% ethanol and redissolved in 50 pl 1X TE. Restriction Analysis of Amplijicntion Products Approximately one-tenth of each amplified sample was subjected to digestion with the appropriate restriction endonuclease in a total volume of 1Op1.Testing for Portuguese/ Japanese/Swedish (Type I, Met-30) was performed using exon 2 amplification products and 10 units NsiI (BRL). Tests for Appalachian (Ala-60), Illinois/German (Tyr-77) or Indiana/Swiss (Type 11, Ser-84) were performed using exon 3 amplification products and 10 units Pvu I1 (BRL), Ssp I (NEB) or Alu I (NEB), respectively. All digestions were done at 37°C for 2 h. One p1 of loading dye was added to each and the digested amplification products were electrophoresed through a 4% composite (3% FMC Nusieve, 1% BRL) agarose gel until the bromophenol blue dye front had migrated to the bottom  of the gel. The gels were stained in ethidium bromide (1 pg/ml) and the digested amplification products visualized using an UV light source. A permanent record was made using Polaroid 6000 B/W film. Results  Incubation of the exon 2 amplification products with Nsi I gave no evidence of digestion. Similarly, no digestion of the exon 3 amplification product was seen with Pvu 11. Alu I gave a single cleavage of the exon 3 product as seen in normal prealbumin. Ssp I, however, digested the exon 3 product to give the pattern seen with the Tyr-77 amyloidosis gene. The unique Ssp I site produced by the point mutation is very close to the middle of the 268 bp amplification product. Tyrosine77 gene carriers show bands of 140 bp and 128 bp resulting from digestion of the variant exon 3 containing amplification product as well as the undigested 268 bp containing the normal exon 3 fragment of the heterozygous carrier (Fig. 2). Dlscusslon  Numerous kindreds with hereditary amyloidosis have been described since the original report in 1952 of the Portuguese disease (Andrade 1952). Most syndromes present as a sensorimotor neuropathy and have been called familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP). In the last 10 years most of the recognized FAP syndromes have been found to be associated with single amino acid variants of plasma prealbumin (transthyretin), which is the protein that accumulates in the amyloid deposits. To date, 7 different amyloid associated mutations (methionine-30, isoleucine33, alanine-60, tyrosine-77, serine-84, methionine-1 1, isoleucine- 122) have been found in this 127 amino acid protein. DNA tests, based on Southern analysis using prealbumin cDNA or genomic DNA probes, have  FA M I L I A L A M Y L O I D O T I C P O LY N E U R 0 P A T H Y  been developed for each of these mutations and used to detect carriers of the variant genes. More recently restriction analysis of amplified segments of the prealbumin gene has been used instead of Southern analysis which requires hybridization with radioactive probes (Nichols’& Benson 1990). Using the technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we have been able to test more rapidly for each of the mutations that were shown to be diagnostic by Southern analysis. Thus the PCR technique was used to analyze DNA from the propositus of this French family and screen for the four most common prealbumin variants. The lack of digestion of the exon 2 PCR product by NsiI and the exon 3 product by Pvu I1 and Alu I essentially excludes the presence of the Met-30, Ala-60 and Ser-84 mutations. The Ssp I digestion, however, confirmed the presence of the Tyr-77 prcalbumin mutation in the propositus and identified 3 non-affected gene carriers. The amyloidosis syndrome in the present family is very similar to the original description with relatively late-onset peripheral neuropathy presenting as typical FAP type I (lower extremity sensorimotor neuropathy. diarrhea and orthostatis) (Wallace et al. 1988). Cardiomyopathy was also a feature of the first kindred described. Since then, two other families with the Tyr-77 gene have been found, each with late-onset disease characterized by Type I neuropathy and cardiomyopathy (unpublished data). Each of these families is in the United States and each is of European extraction. The original kindred with Tyr-77 is German (Prussia or Lithuania). Another family has French Huguenot ancestors but the genealogy is too complex to determine if the gene came from the French branch of the family. Discovery of the Tyr-77 gene in the family from Picardy may help determine the origin of this disease if a single mutation occurred and was spread throughout the world. Recently,  473  multiple mutational events have been postulated for the Met-30 prealbumin gene, based on haplotype analysis and the fact that codon 30 could undergo a cytosine to thymine mutation related to the CpG dinucleotide sequence (Yoshioka et al. 1989). No such prediction can be made for codon 77 because the CpG dinucleotide sequence does not occur in either the positive or negative strand at this position. Even so, the increasing number of unrelated families with Tyr77 prealbumin may represent a different susceptibility for mutation at this site. Haplotype analysis of the different kindreds may help answer this question. References  Andrade, C. (1952). A peculiar form of peripheral neuropathy.

Clinical onset was in the fifth and sixth decades with decreased sensation in the lower limbs followed by involvement of the upper extremities. Motor changes appeared later and evolved to restrict ambulation. Cardiac involvement with congestive heart failure and arrhythmias was the cause of death. DNA analysis was performed on ten members of this family. Restriction enzyme analysis of amplification products of exons 2, 3 and 4 of the prealbumin gene were negative for the methionine-30, alanine-60 and serine-84 mutations but positive for the tyrosine-77 mutation. The tyrosine-77 prealbumin mutation was first described in a family from Illinois with origin in Germany. The discovery of the tyrosine-77 gene in the family from Picardy may help to determine the origin of this disease and tell us if one mutation has been spread around the world, as we suspect, with many kindreds having the methionine-30 gene, or whether there have been separate spontaneous mutational events, perhaps a peculiarity of this site in the prealbumin gene."
"1","Niemann-Pick disease: a frequent missense mutation in the acid sphingomyelinase gene of Ashkenazi Jewish type A and B patients.Although the A and B subtypes of Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) both result from the deficient activity of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM; sphingomyelin cholinephosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.12) and the lysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin, they have remarkably distinct phenotypes. Type A disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder of infancy, whereas type B disease has no neurologic manifestations and is characterized primarily by reticuloendothelial involvement and survival into adulthood. Both disorders are more frequent among individual of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry than in the general population. The recent isolation and characterization of cDNA and genomic sequences encoding ASM has facilitated investigation of the molecular lesions causing the NPD subtypes. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed, and the ASM cDNA from an Ashkenazi Jewish type A patient was specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Molecular analysis of the PCR products revealed a G----T transversion of nucleotide 1487, which occurred at a CpG dinucleotide and predicted an Arg----Leu substitution in residue 496. Hybridization of PCR-amplified genomic DNA with allele-specific oligonucleotides indicated that the proband was homoallelic for the Arg----Leu substitution and that both parents and several other relatives were heterozygous. This mutation was detected in 32% (10 of 31) of the Ashkenazi Jewish NPD type A alleles studied and occurred in only 5.6% (2 of 36) of ASM alleles from non-Jewish type A patients. Of interest, the Arg----Leu substitution occurred in one of the ASM alleles from the two Ashkenazi Jewish NPD type B patients studied and in none of the ASM alleles of 15 non-Jewish type B patients.

These findings identify a frequent missense mutation among NPD patients of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry that results in neuronopathic type A disease when homoallelic and can result in the nonneuronopathic type B phenotype when heteroallelic. The identification of this ASM mutation in Ashkenazi Jewish patients should facilitate the prevention of NPD in this population by carrier detection with molecular diagnostic techniques.Proc. Natl.

The nature of the biochemical and molecular defects that underlie the remarkable clinical heterogeneity in the A and B subtypes remains unknown. Although patients with both subtypes have residual ASM activity (~1 to 10% of normal), biochemical analyses cannot reliably distinguish the two phenotypes. Moreover, the clinical course of type B NPD is highly variable, and it is not presently possible to correlate disease severity with the level of residual ASM activity. Types A and B NPD occur at least 10 times more frequently among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry than in the general population. It is estimated that the incidence of the type A disease among Ashkenazi Jews is -1 in 40,000, a gene frequency (q) of =1 in 200, and a heterozygote frequency (2pq) of -1 in 100 (5). The incidence of type B NPD in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is less frequent, perhaps 1 in 80,000 (5). Thus, the combined heterozygote frequency for types A and B NPD has been estimated to be 1 in 70 among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish decent. Although the enzymatic diagnosis of affected patients with either type A or B NPD can be made reliably (4), the enzymatic detection of obligate heterozygotes has proven problematic, particularly using peripheral leukocytes as the enzyme source. Presumably, the occurrence of neutral sphingomyelinases in some sources and/or the presence of residual ASM activity resulting from the mutant allele have contributed to the inability to reliably discriminate carriers for either disease subtype. Even the use of cultured skin fibroblasts, which do not express the neutral sphingomyelinase, has not provided unambiguous results with obligate heterozygotes (D. A. Wenger, personal  communication). Recently, two partial cDNAs encoding human ASM were isolated and sequenced (6). The type 1 cDNA contained an in-frame 172 base pairs (bp) encoding 57 amino acids; in the type 2 cDNA this sequence was replaced by an in-frame 40 bp encoding 13 different amino acids. Of the 92 positive clones identified by cDNA library screening, the type 1 and 2 cDNAs represented "90 and 10%o, respectively (6). Subsequent isolation and expression of the full-length type 1 and 2 cDNAs demonstrated that only the type 1 transcript was functional (28). The 2347-bp full-length type 1 cDNA had an 87-bp 5' untranslated region, an 1890-bp open reading frame encoding 629 amino acids, and a 370-bp 3' untranslated sequence. Analysis of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)amplified 1665-bp region of genomic DNA revealed that the type 1 and 2 ASM cDNAs resulted from alternative splicing  Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) are autosomal recessive disorders resulting from the deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, acid sphingomyelinase (ASM; sphingomyelin cholinephosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.12) and the accumulation of sphingomyelin, primarily in reticuloendothelial cell lysosomes (1-4). Type A disease is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease of infancy manifested by failure to thrive, severe psychomotor retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, and demise by 2-3 years of age.

Moreover, the localization of a single ASM-encoding gene (designated SMPDI) to the region 11p15.1-pl5.4 by somatic cell and in situ hybridization techniques, supports the occurrence of a single ASM locus (7). In this communication, we identify a mutation in NPD, a G T transversion in nucleotide (nt) 1487 that predicts an Arg Leu substitution at position 496 of the ASM polypeptide (R4%L). Notably, this missense mutation was frequently found in type A and B NPD patients of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.  MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Lines. Primary cultures of fibroblasts and lymphoblasts were established from skin biopsies, and peripheral blood samples were obtained from NPD patients and family members and from normal individuals; informed consent was obtained. NPD cell lines GM00112A, GM00165, GM00370, GM00406, GM00559, GM02895, and GM03252 were obtained from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ).

Cell lines DMN 83.126, DMN 83.133, DMN 84.135, DMN 86.40, DMN 86.49, DMN 87.71, DMN 87.99, DMN 88.9, GJO, and RNS were provided by Peter Penchev (Developmental and Metabolic Neurology Branch, National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke). The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium/10% fetal bovine serum/1% penicillin/ streptomycin at 1 mg/ml by standard procedures (8). The diagnosis of types A and B NPD was based on clinical criteria (e.g., age at onset, presence of neurologic involvement, etc.) and by demonstration of markedly deficient ASM activity in cultured cells (9). Enzyme and Protein Assays. ASM activity was determined in cultured fibroblasts obtained from NPD patients and normal individuals using the fluorescent natural substrate, [N-12(1-pyrenesulfonyl)amido dodecanoyl] sphingomyelin as described (9). One unit of activity equals that amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 nmol of substrate per hr. Protein was determined by a modified fluorescamine assay (10). cDNA and Genomic Amplification and Sequencing of the Mutant Allele. Total RNA and genomic DNA were isolated from cultured skin fibroblasts by standard procedures (11). First-strand cDNA was reverse-transcribed from -5 ,g of total RNA by using a cDNA synthesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). The cDNA (410% of the total reaction) or genomic DNA (-0.5 Ag) was amplified by PCR with Thermus aquaticus (Taq) polymerase (Cetus), essentially as described by Saiki et al. (12) with the following conditions and modifications. PCR was performed for 30 to 40 cycles and consisted of denaturation for 1 min at 94°C and annealing and extension for 4 min at 660C or 720C. To improve the specificity of the PCR amplification for the cDNA, a "PCR boost" procedure was used. In this procedure the concentrations of the primers and Taq polymerase were 0.1 ,uM and 5 units/ml, respectively, for the first 15 cycles. Then each primer was added to a final concentration of 0.5 AM, and an additional 2 units of Taq polymerase was added to the reaction mixture. PCR amplification then proceeded for an additional 15-25 cycles. Pairs of sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 380B DNA synthesizer (13) and used to specifically amplify (i) the entire coding region of the reverse-transcribed type 1 ASM transcript in three overlapping cDNA fragments, (ii) the 1665-bp genomic region containing the alternatively spliced sequences in the type 1 and 2 ASM cDNAs (28), and (iii) a  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 (1991)  3749  genomic region that included the point mutation for confirmation of the candidate missense mutation. To amplify a 984-bp fragment from the 5' end of the ASM cDNA, the 29-mer sense primer, P1 (5'-AGTAGTCTCGAGACGGGACAGACGAACCA-3'), corresponded to ASM, nt -39 to -23 with an additional 12 nt that included an Xho I restriction site and the 31-mer antisense primer, P2 (5'-AGTAGTCTGCAGAGCAGGGTACATGGCACTG-3'), corresponded to ASM nt 926 to 945 with an additional 12 nt containing an EcoRI restriction site. To amplify an internal 383-bp fragment of the ASM cDNA, the 29-mer sense primer, P3 (5'-ATCATCAAGCTTGGGTAACCATGAAAGCA-3'), corresponded to ASM nt 947-964 with an additional 12 nt containing a HindIII restriction site, and the antisense 32-mer primer, P4 (5'-ATCATCGAATTCTACAATTCGGTAATAATTCC-3'), corresponded to ASM nt 1310 to 1330 with an additional 12 nt containing an EcoRI restriction site. To amplify a 789-bp 3' fragment from the ASM cDNA, a 19-mer sense primer, P5 (5'-CTCCACGGATCCCGCAGGA-3'), corresponded to ASM nt 1185 to 1203 and contained an internal BamHI restriction site, and an antisense 32-mer primer, P6 (5'-AGTAGTGTCGACTTGCCTGGTTGAACCACAGC), corresponded to ASM nt 1955 to 1974 with an additional 12 nt containing a Sal I restriction site. Primers P3 and P4 also were used to amplify the 1665-bp internal genomic region that contains the alternatively spliced type 1 and 2 cDNA sequences. To confirm the candidate mutation by genomic sequencing and dot-blot analysis (see below), a 27-mer sense primer, P7 (5'-AGTAGTCGACATGGGCAGGATGTGTGG3'), was used with antisense primer P6 to amplify a 567-bp genomic fragment containing the G -+ T transversion. After PCR amplification, the products were isolated from agarose gels and subcloned into either Bluescript KS (+) (Stratagene) or pGEM 7Zf (-) (Promega) vectors. For each amplified product, from four to six independent subclones were sequenced in both orientations by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method (14). Dot-Blot Analysis. Any nucleotide change that occurred in more than two subcloned PCR products was considered a candidate mutation and analyzed by dot-blot hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides. In addition, allelespecific oligonucleotides were constructed and used as probes to analyze amplified genomic DNA from normal individuals and NPD patients and family members. From these studies genomic DNA was rapidly isolated from either whole blood or cultured cells by the following procedure. About 0.5 ml of whole blood and 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.5/5 mM MgCl2/0.32 M sucrose/1% Triton X-100) were mixed at room temperature. After centrifugation at 13,000 x g, the supernatant was removed, and 0.5 ml of PCR buffer (10 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 8.3/50 mM KCI/2.5 mM MgCl2/gelatin at 0.1 mg/ml/0.45% NonidetP40/0.45% Tween 20/proteinase K at 0.1 mg/ml) was added. For cultured cells, the lysis step was omitted, and the washed cell pellets were resuspended directly in PCR buffer (-5 x 106 cells per ml). The samples were then incubated at 60°C for 1 hr and boiled for 10 min to inactivate the protease; then 25 ,ul was removed for PCR amplification. After agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products, the concentration of each product was estimated by ethidium bromide staining. For each sample -0.5 ,ug of DNA was used for the dot-blot analysis. For the analysis of the R4%L mutation, the 567-bp PCR product amplified from genomic DNA was analyzed by dot-blot hybridization (11) by using Zetabind nylon membranes (AMF Cuno) and a Bio-Rad dot-blot apparatus. Hybridizations were performed for at least 3 hr at 39°C. After hybridization, the blots were washed at room temperature for 15 min in 6x SSC (1x SSC is 0.15 M sodium chloride/0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0)/0.1% SDS and then for 2 hr in the same solution at either 53TC for the normal (5'-CTATTTG-  Genetics: Levran et al.  3750  Proc.

RESULTS Identification of the R496L Mutation in an Ashkenazi Jewish Type A NPD Patient. To determine the molecular lesions in an Ashkenazi Jewish type A NPD patient (proband 1), who had '1% of normal ASM activity in cultured fibroblasts, total RNA was isolated from cultured lymphoblasts and reversetranscribed into cDNA; then the entire coding region was PCR amplified. Nucleotide sequencing of the subcloned PCR products revealed a single point mutation in a CpG dinucleotide,  a  G  -+  T transversion of nt 1487 of the  (Fig. 1). This transversion predicted  an  full-length cDNA Arg -- Leu substi-  tution in residue 496 of the ASM polypeptide (designated R496L). All other base substitutions occurred in only one or two of the subcloned PCR products analyzed. To confirm the authenticity of this candidate mutation, a 567-bp region of genomic DNA from the proband, various family members, and 90 normal Ashkenazi Jewish individuals was PCR amplified and then hybridized with normal and R496L-specific radiolabeled oligonucleotides. As shown in Fig. 2, the PCR-amplified genomic DNA from proband 1 hybridized to the mutation-specific, but not to the normal allele-specific oligonucleotide, confirming the authenticity of  s  Normal  \NlIIItariI t  the transversion and indicating that proband 1 was homoallelic for the R496L mutation. Of the nine other family members studied, both parents, the paternal grandfather, and a paternal aunt were heterozygous for the R496L mutation. The maternal grandmother did not have the mutation, suggesting that the maternal grandfather was heterozygous for this mutation. There was no known consanguinity between the maternal or paternal grandfathers whose ancestors were from different European countries. Moreover, the R496L mutation was not found in 180 ASM alleles studied from a group of normal Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, indicating that the G  -*  T transversion  was  not  a common  polymor-  phism. Occurrence of R496L in Ashkenazi Jewish and Non-Jewish NPD Type A Families. The occurrence of R496L in other NPD families was determined by dot-blot analysis of genomic DNA from 17 unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish and 18 unrelated non-Jewish type A NPD families. As indicated in Table 1, of the 31 Ashkenazi Jewish NPD alleles studied (i.e., from 6 unrelated patients and 19 unrelated obligate heterozygotes), 32% had the R496L mutation. Only proband 1 was homoallelic for the mutation, whereas three obligate heterozygotes from unrelated families in which material from patients was unavailable were heteroallelic for the R496L mutation. In contrast, only 2 of 36 (5;6%) alleles had the R496L mutation in non-Jewish NPD type A patients. An American of German ancestry was homoallelic for the R496L mutation.  ..  *'  0@*  FIG. 2.

Occurrence of the R496L Mutation in Ashkenazi Jewish and Non-Jewish NPD Type B Families. Analysis of genomic DNA from two unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish NPD type B patients revealed the presence of one R496L allele in one patient (designated proband 2). In contrast, the R4%L allele was not found in genomic DNAs from 15 non-Jewish NPD type B patients (Table 1).  DISCUSSION Insights into the molecular nature of the remarkably distinct type A and B NPD phenotypes have been gained by the identification of a mutation in the ASM gene causing this lysosomal storage disease. The G -* T transversion of coding nt 1487 occurred at a CpG dinucleotide, a known hotspot for point mutations (15) and predicted the R496L change in the ASM polypeptide. Homoallelism for the R496L mutation resulted in the severe neuronopathic type A phenotype, as evidenced by proband 1, who had =1% or normal ASM activity. It is not known whether the substitution of the basic arginine for the more hydrophobic and neutral leucine residue altered the enzyme polypeptide catalytic activity, stability, or both, because monospecific anti-human ASM antibodies useful for immunoblotting are not currently available. Of the 17 unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish type A families studied, 9 were either homoallelic or heteroallelic for this lesion. In this sample, the frequency of the R496L allele was 32%, indicating that this lesion is an important mutation in type A NPD among Ashkenazi Jewish patients. It is likely that there is another more frequent mutation or, perhaps, multiple mutations, causing type A NPD in Ashkenazi Jewish patients. In contrast, analysis of 18 unrelated non-Jewish type A patients revealed the presence of the R496L allele in only 1 (a frequency of 5.6%). The presence of the R4%L allele in this individual may have resulted from an independent mutational event or the occurrence of Jewish ancestors in this family. One of the two Ashkenazi Jewish type B NPD patients studied was heteroallelic for the R4%L mutation. The other allele in this Jewish type B patient had a different ASM mutation, which presumably resulted in the synthesis of a partially functional ASM polypeptide, as this patient had -5% residual ASM activity in cultured fibroblasts. The fact that none of the 15 non-Jewish type B patients had the R496L allele suggests that this allele is extremely rare in type B disease outside of the Ashkenazi population. That the R496L mutation was not a common polymorphism in the Ashkenazi Jewish population was supported by the fact that it was not present in 180 ASM alleles analyzed from normal Ashkenazi Jewish individuals. For the past three decades, the genetic mechanisms responsible for the high frequency of the mutations that cause Tay-Sachs disease, Gaucher disease, and NPD in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (gene frequencies of -0.02, 0.02, and 0.005, respectively) have been the subject of interest and  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 (1991)  3751  debate (16-20). Intrigued by the fact that all three of these disorders are lysosomal diseases resulting from enzymatic defects in the sphingolipid degradative pathway, investigators suggested that there may have been a common selective pressure for their high gene frequencies in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (20). Others argued that the higher gene frequencies in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals could be due to higher mutation rates for these genes (16) or founder effect and genetic drift (19). The recent identification of the mutations causing these three diseases in the Ashkenazi Jewish population has provided insight into this controversy. To date, three mutations in the 13-hexosaminidase a chain (localized to chromosomal region 15q23-24) have been identified as the cause of Tay-Sachs disease in almost all Ashkenazi Jewish patients. Two of these mutations result in the infantile form, a 4-bp insertion (21) or a splice-site mutation (22), which account for -80 and 20% of the mutant alleles, respectively. Affected Ashkenazi Jewish patients with the less frequent and milder chronic or adult-onset form all have been heteroallelic for a point mutation Gly -* Ser at position 269 (23) and one of the two infantile-onset alleles. Type 1 Gaucher disease among Ashkenazi Jewish patients results from multiple mutations in the acid 83-glucosidase gene (localized to chromosomal region 1q21-q31), the Asn -* Ser (at position 370) allele occurring in -75% of the mutant alleles, whereas the other 25% include several other lesions (24). With the identification of the R4%L mutation causing NPD, it appears that in the Ashkenazi Jewish population each of these sphingolipidoses results from a common mutation (i.e., -70%o or more of the mutant alleles) and at least one or more less frequent mutations in their respective genes. The fact that two or more mutant alleles in each gene occur frequently in this population argues for selection, rather than for a higher mutation rate or founder effect and genetic drift, as the major mechanism responsible for their increased frequency. Although it is likely that the major mutation for each disease first became established in the Ashkenazi Jewish population by founder effect and genetic drift, the finding of two or more mutations in each of these genes supports a selective advantage. Because all three disorders involve defects in lysosomal enzymes that degrade sphingolipids, it is tempting to suggest that a common selective agent, such as resistance to an adverse situation (e.g., an infectious disease), could have increased the heterozygote frequency by differential survival (thus, increased fitness) for individuals heterozygous for each of these disorders. Alternatively, heterozygosity for these mutations may have been selected for by unrelated pressures in the past. Although several hypotheses have been advanced (20, 25), the nature of the selective advantages for these mutations remains unknown. The identification of the R4%L allele and other mutations in. the ASM gene in types A and B NPD may provide information for genotype-phenotype correlations and permit more accurate genetic counseling for newly diagnosed cases in families without a previously affected individual. Identification of other mutations, particularly those with residual activity that cause type B disease, also may provide structure-function information and may facilitate delineation of the active-site region. Previously, the enzymatic detection of heterozygotes for NPD types A and B was not sufficiently reliable to permit mass voluntary screening in the Ashkenazi Jewish community. Thus, the identification of the R496L and other mutations in types A and B NPD will permit accurate heterozygote identification in families with these lesions as well as heterozygote screening and prevention of NPD in the general Ashkenazi Jewish population, as has been the prototypic experience with Tay-Sachs disease (26). Using molecular techniques, we and others (ref. 27; H. Yoo, personal communication) have already demonstrated the feasibility of molecular heterozygote screening for Tay-Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The extension of  3752  Genetics: Levran et al.  such molecular screening to include the more common mutations causing Gaucher disease and NPD by the use of multiplex PCR should permit the simultaneous screening and prevention of all three sphingolipidoses in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.

AR mutant V866M was able to stimulate CAT activity but the androgen dose dependency was shifted toward pharmacological concentrations of steroid that exceed in vivo levels. The molecular basis of CAIS in humans exhibits genetic heterogeneity.· Our study shows that some cases of CAIS are explained by an inability to form a functional AR-steroid complex and hence, the AR is unable to activate transcription of genes essential for male sex differentiation during fetal development. (Molecular Endocrinology 4: 1759-1772, 1990)  Mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) are thought to cause complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS) in 46,XY human subjects who have a female phenotype despite normal adult male concentrations of plasma testosterone. Assays of AR binding in cultured skin fibroblasts from subjects with CAIS show either an apparent absence of AR (AR-) or normal levels of AR (AR+) binding. In several subj~cts with CAIS, AR-, no gross AR mutation was detected by South· ern blot analyses of genomic DNA and normal sized 10 kilobase mRNA was present on Northern blots of poly(A+) RNA from cultured genital skin fibroblasts. We have used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify individual exons within the human AR gene of subjects with CAIS and have identified point mutations in three subjects. In one AR- subject (R774C), amino acid 774 was changed from arginine (CGC) to cysteine (TGC), in another AR- subject (R831Q), arginine (CGA) was changed to glutamine (CAA) at position 831, and in an AR+ subject (V866M) a methionine (ATG) was substituted for valine (GTG) at position 866. ' Transfection of wild type and mutant AR cDNA clones into COS cells results in detection of AR protein by immunoblotting. AR ligand binding activity is absent in cells transfected with AR mutants R774C and R831Q, but present with AR mutant V866M. Androgen binding in cells transfected with AR mutant V866M has a 6-fold lower apparent binding affinity than that of wild-type AR. Transcriptional activation of the MMTV·CAT reporter gene was androgen dependent and specific and nearly maximal  INTRODUCTION  The androgen insensitivity syndrome is an X-chromosome linked disorder expressed in 46,XY human subjects (1 ). Variable phenotypic expression has been observed, ranging from a complete female phenotype to male genitalia with mild hypospadias (1 ). Evidence suggests also that the syndrome includes some rare cases of phenotypically normal males with azoospermia (2, 3). In the complete form of androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), affected subjects present a female external genitalia but with a short vagina and absent Mullerian ducts. Gonads are normal-size testes located in the abdominal or inguinal area with hypoplastic Wolffian derivatives. At puberty, normal female secondary sex characteristics occur, but pubic hair is usually sparse or absent. In adulthood, serum testosterone and LH  0888-8809/90/1759-1772$02.00/0 Molecular Endocrinology Copyright© 1990 by The Endocrine Society  1759  Vol 4 No. 12  MOL ENDO, 1990 1760  concentrations are at or above the normal adult male range. Multiple studies have demonstrated that this syndrome is caused by target organ insensitivity to the actions of testosterone and its more potent 5a-reduced metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (1, 4). Although testosterone is able to induce fetal differentiation and development of the Wolffian duct system, the biologically more active androgen, DHT, is required for differentiation and development of the prostate gland and for the male external genitalia (5). Androgenic effects during fetal development require the formation of a biologically active androgen receptor-steroid complex (6). An impairment in androgen receptor (AR) function can account for target organ insensitivity and evidence for such impairment has been reported for numerous families with androgen insensitivity (AIS) (1, 4). The AR belongs to the subfamily of steroid hormone receptors within a larger family of nuclear proteins that likely evolved from a common ancestral gene (7, 8). Structurally, the 110 kilodalton AR contains an amino terminal region that is variable in length and may have a role in transcriptional activation, a central, cysteinerich hydrophilic DNA-binding domain, as well as a carboxyl terminal hydrophobic hormone-binding domain. After hormone binding, the DHT-AR complex, probably as a dimer, interacts with hormone response elements on specific target genes to modulate the transcriptional activity of their promoters (9, 10). The heterogeneity in phenotypic expression of AIS is due to a variety of AR defects, some of which are detectable by biochemical methods (1, 4). For example, AR binding in cultured genital skin fibroblasts of subjects with CAIS may be undetectable, in the so-called receptor negative (AR-) form (11 ), whereas others have quantitatively normal binding, termed the receptor positive (AR+) form (12). Cloning of human cDNA encoding the AR has been reported (13-16). Using cDNA probes for the human AR gene, we have previously detected a partial deletion in the steroid-binding domain in one family with CAIS, AR- (17). However, five other families with CAIS, AR- did not have any detectable gross molecular lesion in their AR gene, suggesting a point mutation or small undetected deletion or insertion. In one other family with the AR+ form of CAIS (18), we have reported a missense point mutation' in the steroidbinding domain of the AR gene that predicted a single amino acid substitution at position 866 of the AR protein (19). In this report, we demonstrate that mutant ARs resulting from point mutations causing single amino acid substitutions in the steroid binding domain of the protein are functionally defective. In two unrelated families with the AR- form of CAIS, the two different mutant ARs are expressed but do not bind androgen and are defective in transcription activation. In the family with CAIS, AR+, the mutant AR binds androgen with significantly lower affinity and its ability to activate transcription is dependent upon higher concentrations of hormone.  RESULTS Identification of AR Mutations  Previous studies from our laboratory using various human AR cDNA probes to screen for AR mutations on Southern blots prepared by restriction endonuclease digestion of genomic DNA from human subjects with CAIS showed a partial gene deletion in only one affected family (17). Seven other unrelated families showed no deletion, suggesting that point mutations or small, undetectable deletions or insertions are responsible for the androgen insensitivity. Poly(A+) RNA was prepared from genital skin fibroblasts of eight affected human subjects with complete AIS, seven with the ARform and one with the AR+ form. Except for the one subject with a partial gene deletion (subject B), a normal size 10 kilobase (kb) AR mRNA is detected in all subjects (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that the AR gene is transcribed normally in subjects with CAIS, even in subjects D-1 with no detectable AR binding activity in cultured fibroblasts. In order to identify the AR mutations present in subjects with CAIS, we analyzed individual exons of the human AR gene by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) after amplification of genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. The 5' -oligonucleotide primers in each amplification reaction contained a 40base pair (bp) G-C sequence which functioned as a highly stable DNA duplex clamp in the DGGE. For two subjects with CAIS, AR-, we observe an altered mobility for exons 6 and 7 (Fig. 2, subject 5). We also observe altered mobility on DGGE of the amplified exon 7 DNA fragment from the subject with CAIS, AR+ (Fig. 2, subject 4). Two additional amplifications of either exon 6 or 7 from the genomic DNA of these subjects were performed. Each exon was sequenced in both 5' and 3'-directions by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. A single nucleotide base substitution is detected in each of the three AR gene sequences (Fig. 3). For one subject with CAIS, AR-, a c-T base change occurs in exon 6 resulting in the amino acid substitution of cysteine (TGC) for the wild-type arginine (CGC) at position 77 4 (AR R77 4C). In exon 7 of the other subject with CAIS, AR-, a G--" A base substitution occurred to alter the codon for amino acid 831 from CGA (arginine) in the wild-type sequence to CAA (glutamine) (AR R831 Q). We also confirmed our previously published observation (19) by our current methodology, the detection of a G--" A base change in exon 7 for the subject with the AR+ form of CAIS, resulting in the substitution of methionine (ATG) for the wild-type valine (GTG) at position 866 (AR V866M). Inheritance of AR Mutations  If these point mutations in the human AR gene are associated with CAIS, they should conform to an Xlinked recessive pattern of inheritance in affected pedigrees. Point mutations affecting amino acids 774 and  AR Functional Defect in AIS  1761  A B AR  wt  •  C +  D  E  F  G H  --  kb  9.6.....,. 6.6 +-  4.3.....,.  Fig. 1.

Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis of Human AR Exon 7 GC-clamped PCR fragments of exon 7 were electrophoresed in a denaturing gradient gel with 20-80% denaturant. PCR amplified DNA fragments were from genomic DNA of normal subjects (wt, wild-type) and those with CAIS of the AR- or AR+ form or the partial form of AIS (subject 10), with reduced receptor binding, AR±. CAIS subject 4 (AR+) has mutation V866M and subject 5 (AR-) has mutation R831 Q.  831 were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis of the amplified DNA fragments from exons 6 and 7, respectively. The AR-R831 Q nucleotide substitution abolishes a restriction endonuclease cleavage site shared by BstBI and Taql within the 417-bp DNA frag-  ment containing exon 7. BstBI digestion of amplified DNA fragments from exon 7 of wild-type, two affected 46,XY family members and the obligate heterozygous 46,XX females from two generations demonstrates the expected restriction fragments from the mutant or wildtype genes (Fig. 4). In addition, the AR-R774C mutation abolishes the Kpnl site in genomic DNA or the PCR amplified DNA fragment in the 5'-portion of exon 6 from the affected subject (data not shown). In other experiments, amplified DNA fragments containing exon 7 from hemizygous 46,XY affected subjects and heterozygous 46,XX carrier subjects with the AR R831 Q and V866M mutations all display the expected pattern of electrophoretic mobility upon DGGE (data not shown). The two affected 46,XY family members with the R831 Q mutation and three affected 46,XY siblings with the V866M mutation, each show a single DNA fragment with altered electrophoretic mobility similar to that shown in Fig. 2 for subjects 5 (AR-) and 4 (AR+), respectively. The two heterozygous 46,XX subjects carrying the R831 Q mutation and the obligate heterozygous mother of the three siblings with the V866M mutation, each exhibit four ethidium bromide stained bands upon DGGE, representing the four combinations of DNA duplex molecules after denaturation/ reannealing of the polymerase chain reaction amplified products of the sense and antisense strands of the wild-type and mutant alleles. Taken together, these results demonstrate a pattern of X-linked inheritance and provide evidence for a strong association between the AR gene point mutations and CAIS.  Vol 4 No. i2  MOL ENDO· i 990  1762  HUMAN ANDROGEN RECEPTOR N-terminus  7 O6 72o 565 77 I 34 8  j  DNA  j  SteJoid  E LGERqL V H V)'l<'.VIAl<'.cA U)\;1f'.RNW:H V D().QM AV.I \?Y$1'/.M;G¼M Vf;A oLGERQL Ls VNtWSl<'.$ LJ?G;fRNLH r oq91 rplpY$.\i/M$'l.M Vf\'G M l.GGRQV I AAYl<'.W.A.KA I PG;FRN LH LDPQM TILLQY:$\VMF l;M AFA RLAGKQM I OVVKWAKV LPGFKNLP LEDO!

Identical amino acids (shaded areas) are indicated relative to HAR. The amino acid substitutions at positions 774, 831, and 866 of the human AR mutants presented in this study are shown as an outlined single letter amino acid code at the appropriate positions.  Construction and Expression of Mutant AR cDNAs  Having demonstrated the association bf AR gene point mutations with CAIS, we went on to show the effect of each mutation on the biological function of AR. Complementary DNA fragments containing each of the three nucleotide base changes from the two AR- and one AR+ subjects, were ligated into the Hindlll/BamHI sites of the parent wild-type pCMV expression vector so as to construct a human AR cDNA with the representative mutations (Fig. 5). The presence of each nucleotide base substitution at the appropriate position and the absence of other base changes was verified by sequencing the complete Hindlll/BamHI fragment from each plasmid. The pCMV human AR expression vector containing  the wild-type AR sequence or mutations AR-R774C, R831 Q and -V866M was co-transfected into COS-1 monkey kidney cells along with the plasmid pCH110, containing the lac Z gene driven by the SV40 promoter. Transfection efficiency was determined by comparing AR to ,6-galactosidase activity. lmmunoblots of human AR protein expression in transfected COS-1 cells were performed with each of the five following transfections: mock COS, AR-wt, ARR774C, AR-R831Q, and AR-V866M. For the wild-type and each of the three mutants, a protein of 110 kDa reacted specifically with hAR52 antiserum which recognizes an epitope immediately 5' to the DNA binding domain (Fig. 6). To determine whether the expressed AR proteins could bind androgen, COS-1 cells were transfected and  AR Functional Defect in AIS  1763  D B  std  bp  wt • Bst  C  A • Bst  • Bst  • Bst  • Bst  p5HEBhAR·1 7.8 kb  1078~ 603~ 310 ....  234~  Tth 111 I Bgl II  I  Hindi"'  Sph I  I Hlnfl I  Barn H I  Pstll  I  3.1 Kb androgen receptor cDNA  I  Fig. 4.

The digested DNA was electrophoresed on a 4% NuSieve GTG agarose gel with 0X 174-Haelll digested DNA as a standard. Genomic DNA was from one normal subject (wt) and four members (A-D) of a pedigree with CAIS, AR- determined to have mutation R831 Q: A, 46,XY subject with CAIS, AR-; B, 46,XX obligate heterozygous mother of subject A; C, sibling of subject B with CAIS, AR-; and D, 46,XX obligate heterozygous mother of subjects B and C.  incubated with a saturating concentration of 3 H-R1881 (5 nM) for 2 h and assayed for the level of specific androgen receptor binding activity. In cells transfected with either AR-wt or AR-V866M, a high level of 3 HR1881 binding is observed (Table 1). However, when cells are mock-transfected or transfected with ARR?? 4C and AR-R831 Q, specific 3 H-R 1881 binding is absent. Scatchard analyses of 3 H-R1881 binding in replicate plates of COS cells transfected with AR-wt (0.05-1.5 nM 3 H-R1881) or AR-V866M (0.2-5.0 nM 3 HR1881) shows a 6.5-fold lower apparent binding affinity (Kd) for the mutant receptor (2.46 nM) than for the wildtype receptor (0.38 nM) (Fig. 7). This result is similar to the difference in binding affinity reported earlier for cultured genital skin fibroblasts (18) from normal subjects and three affected siblings of this pedigree with complete AIS, AR+ (AR-V866M) (Table 1). Furthermore, the absence of R1881 binding in COS-1 cells transfected with AR-R77 4C and AR-R831 Q is not due to the lack of protein translation nor to a truncated or significantly unstable AR protein created by any of the mutations.

The mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat (MMTVLTR) contains four partial inverted repeats of the sequence, TGTTCT, which function as response elements for AR, as well as for glucocorticoid and progestin receptors. Therefore, we cotransfected cells with the MMTV-LTR-CAT reporter gene, with pCH110 containing the lac Z gene, and with the AR expression vector constructs. CAT activity is absent in CV-1 cells if steroid is not added, regardless of the transfection of wild-type or mutant human ARs (Fig. 8). In the presence of 1O nM androgen (DHT or R1881), AR-wt or AR-V866M, both of which bind androgen, significantly induce CAT activity when expressed in CV-1 cells. By contrast, the AR- mutants, AR-R774C and AR-R831 Q, are totally ineffective in stimulating CAT activity when androgen is added.

AR-wt is, however, able to induce CAT activity upon the addition of 10 nM estradiol, whereas none of the mutant AR proteins, including AR-V866M, is able to stimulate CAT activity in the presence of estrogen. When the level of CAT activity is quantified by a twophase partitioning radioactive scintillation assay, distinct differences are observed in the ability of the various androgen ligands to induce enzyme activity with the wild-type receptor, AR-wt, and the AR+ mutant, ARV866M (Fig. 9). Using a range of steroid concentrations from 0.1-10 nM, DHT, R1881, and testosterone cause a dose-dependent increase in CAT activity. However, distinct differences are observed between the ability of AR-wt and AR-V866M to stimulate CAT activity at a given concentration of DHT, R1881, or testosterone. At the highest concentration of steroid (10 nM), little difference is seen between AR-wt and AR-V866M, the increase being about 100-fold above the baseline level observed in the absence of steroid. However, at 0.1 nM DHT or R1881, a major difference in the magnitude of CAT stimulation by the same two receptor contructs is  AR Functional Defect in AIS  1765  AR wt  ••  •• 1  2  3  cont  4  6  5  9 10 11 12  Dex  R1881  DHT  8  7  Prog  DISCUSSION  E2  AR R774C  • •• •• 2  1  4  3  DHT  cont  5  6  R1881  8  7  Dex  • 9  10 11  Prog  12  E2  AR R831Q  1  2  cont  3  4  DHT  5  6  7  R1881  8  9  Dex  10 11  Prog  12  E2  AR V866M  • 1  2  cont  3  4  DHT  5  6  R1881  7  8  Dex  and estradiol (10 nM) are added in combination, there is no evidence for synergism or antagonism, the stimulation of CAT activity for AR-wt by the two steroids is additive and for AR-V866M is equivalent to 1.0 nM DHT alone .  ~  10 11  Prog  12  E2  Fig. 8.

When 10 nM estradiol is added to the cells, an 11-fold increase of CAT activity over baseline occurs in cells with AR-wt but no effect is observed for AR-V866M. When DHT (1.0 nM)  The AR is a member of the steroid, thyroid, and retinoic acid hormone recE;lptor superfamily of proteins that mediate the action~ of their respective cognate ligands through the regulation of g(;lne transcription (7-10). The proteins are modular in nature, comprised of a highly variable N-terminal domain, thought to function in transcriptional l;lctivation, and well-characterized DNA- and hormone-binding domains (20, 21 ). The latter regulates, in unknown fashion, the ability of the DNA-binding domain of the protein to recognize DNA sequence elements of responsive genes and modulates the transcription of those genes. Several pathophysiological conditions in humans result not from a lack of the hormone but rather from an impairment of the mechanism which activates hormoneresponsive genes. These conditions of hormone insensitivity in humans have been described for thyroid (22), vitamin D (21), glucocorticoid (24), mineralocorticoid (25), and androgen (1, 4). In androgen insensitivity, biochemical studies have shown that the impairment in hormonal responsiveness correlates with defects in binding of androgen to its receptor (1, 4, 11, 12, 18). This study shows that ligand binding and transcriptional activation are impaired due to naturally occurring mutations in the androgen receptor gene and establishes the conclusion that AR defects underlie the condition of CAIS in humans. The heterogeneous nature of human CAIS became apparent from studies of AR binding in cultured genital skin fibroblasts from affected subjects (1 , 11 , 12). In some cases of CAIS, AR binding was undetectable (AR-), whereas in others quantitatively normal binding (AR+) was observed. More recently using cDNA probes for the human AR gene, we reported that a partial deletion was responsible tor complete androgen insensitivity in one family (17). While this finding provided an explanation for the physiological insensitivity and the absence of AR binding activity in cultured genital skin fibroblasts from affected members of this family, other families with absent AR binding had no apparent structural defect in the AR gene (17). In fact, AR gene transcription also appeared normal on Northern blots of poly(A+) RNA isolated from cultured genital skin fibroblasts of six subjects with CAIS, AR-, and one patient with CAIS, AR+. On this basis, we suggested that point mutc1tions in the AR gene might be responsible for the expression of androgen insensitivity in these subjects. Appropriately, we identified a single nucleotide substitution within the open reading frame of the gene in the AR+ family who had quantitatively  Vol 4 No. 12  MOL ·ENDO, 1990 1766  150  f. ., i.,  Ill  AR~wt  ~  AR-V866M  _ 100 it  s~ i~ C  .Q  "  <(  0  6  ti:,  ....

Three replicate plates of cells were subsequently incubated for 36 h with 0.1-10 nM DHT or R1881, 1.0 nM testosterone (T), 10 nM E2 or a combination of 1 nM DHT and 10 nM E2, CAT activity was measured by incubation of extracts from transfected, steroid-treated cells with chloramphenicol, and 3 H-acetyl CoA. The partitioning of the 3 Hacetylated chloramphenicol reaction products into an organic scintillation cocktail was monitored over time by repetitive scintillation spectrophotometric counting. All reactions were linear for greater than 3 h at room temperature with a correlation coefficient (r) of greater than or equal to 0.95 determined by linear regression analysis. Fold induction of CAT activity over baseline was calculated from the linear slope of each kinetic reaction curve using the following formula:  CAT(AR-transfected ,6-gal(AR-transfected  + steroid) + steroid)  [CAT(mock transfected) - CAT(no cell extract)] ,6-gal(mock transfected)  The bars represent the mean ± SEM from the three replicate plates of cells per group assayed in duplicate.  normal but qualitatively abnormal AR binding activity (18). The nucleotide change (G - A) resulted in the substitution of methionine for valine in amino acid position 866 (19). Although this amino acid substitution was correlated with CAIS in three affected members of this family and was transmitted as an X-linked trait, functional studies of the putative mutant AR were not obtained. In this study, we report point mutations in the AR genes of two unrelated families with CAIS, AR-. Because their receptors did not bind DHT in cultured genital skin fibroblasts (1), we amplified in each family, exons 4 to 8 of the AR gene which encode the steroidbinding domain (13). In one family, the point mutation occurs in exon 7 with a G - A change resulting in an amino acid substitution of glutamine for arginine at position 831 (13). Based upon restriction endonuclease digestion of DNA with BstBI, we showed the X-linked inheritance of this mutation. In a second family, we identify within exon 6, a single nucleotide substitution (C - T) that results in the substitution of a cysteine for an arginine at amino acid position 77 4 (13). This substitution eliminates a Kpnl restriction endonuclease cleavage site near the 5' -border of exon 6, a finding recently reported to occur in three other unrelated families (26-28). We cloned each of these point mutations into an AR expression vector (13) and transfected them into COS cells. The presence of the expressed proteins was verified by immunoblotting with an AR  specific antiserum (13). The fact that both proteins are unable to bind R1881 with high affinity or to transactivate the MMTV-CAT reporter gene in an in vitro transfection assay for biological function, provides definitive proof linking these single amino acid substitutions with the condition of CAIS. A multifunctional role in hormone action has been proposed for the steroid binding domain. In addition to the well-documented role of this C-terminal domain in steroid binding, it also functions in transcriptional activation and receptor dimerization (29-37). Our results demonstrate that a single amino acid substitution within the steroid binding domain from a basic residue, arginine, at positions 774 or 831, to a polar amino acid like cysteine or to glutamine, respectively, can eliminate the hormone binding capacity of the protein. The normal function of the steroid is to bind AR and to release the inhibitory influence of the unoccupied receptor on transcription activation; a biological activity that is defective in mutants R774 and R831 Q. Therefore, these naturally occurring inactive mutant ARs are differentiated from the genetically engineered AR deletion mutants of the steroid binding domain which are constitutive activators of transcription (38). Interestingly, the mutations in AR, R774C, and R831 Q, occur in arginine residues that are not contained within blocks of conserved amino acid homology among the various steroid receptors shown in Fig. 3. However, the wild-type AR amino acid residue arginine  AR Functional Defect in AIS  is conserved among the most highly homologous neighbors of the human AR, namely glycocorticoid receptor (GR) and progesterone receptor (PR) (Fig. 3). The fact that the wild-type arginine residues at positions 774 and 831 are neither unique nor completely conserved among all steroid receptors suggests that they do not directly contact the steroid molecule. Instead, the lack of steroid binding and consequent lack of transcription activation in these mutants is likely to be the result of an altered conformation in the AR protein that prevents hormone binding, and thus transcription activation, but does not significantly influence its turnover as shown by immunoblotting. Interestingly, a human AR cDNA clone isolated from a human testis cDNA library contains four amino acid substitutions in the region immediately adjacent to R831 Q (39). This sequence alteration results in an AR protein which does not bind steroid with high affinity and also fails to activate gene transcription in vitro. Although many cases of CAIS result from the absence of ligand binding by AR, relatively fewer cases are characterized by quantitatively normal but qualitatively abnormal androgen binding activity (1 , 4, 18). The mutation V866M (valine - methionine) represents such a case, where a normal to elevated number of ARs were measured in cultured genital skin fibroblasts but the apparent binding affinity for DHT was decreased by severalfold (18). Expression of this mutant in the AR expression vector resulted in an AR protein with over 6-fold reduced affinity for binding of R1881 . When the mutant AR cDNA expression vector was cotransfected with the MMTV-CAT reporter gene, a dose-dependent androgen stimulation of CAT activity by R1881 or DHT was observed. At physiological steroid concentrations of 0.1 nM, the mutant AR-V866M stimulated CAT activity only minimally, much less than AR-wt. At high concentrations of steroid (1 O nM), mutant AR-V866M stimulated gene transcription in vitro, an effect that would not occur in vivo at physiological concentrations of free androgen available to the target cells. The relatively low induction of CAT activity by mutant AR-V866M was steroid concentration dependent and the potency of effect followed the relative binding affinities for R1881 > DHT > testosterone to AR (40). Interestingly, the V866M and wild-type AR are also distinguished by the induction of CAT activity by estradiol. AR-wt stimulates CAT activity in the presence of 10 nM estradiol but V866M does not, suggesting that sufficiently high concentrations of estradiol may actually activate gene transcription by binding to the wild-type AR (41, 42). The mechanism by which the point mutation V866M results in only a modest change in steroid binding properties of the AR but causes total loss of in vivo AR functional activity is not yet clear. It appears that complete transformation of the receptor subsequent to steroid binding requires precise structural interaction between receptor and ligand (37). Steroid antagonists, for example, have recently been shown to bind estrogen receptor (ER) and GR and promote specific binding to hormone response elements without enhancing gene  1767  transcription as would a normal agonist. Hormone binding domains of ,nuclear receptors are now recognized to have transcription activation function (31, 33-37). Ligand binding to AR and other steroid hormone receptors initiates a transformation process that results in enhanced binding of receptors to their hormone response elements (29-32). This process may involve a conformational change in the receptor protein or separation from a nonsteroid-binding component that unmasks the DNA-binding domain and a nuclear transfer sequence located in the C-terminal region downstream from the DNA-binding domain. The process may also activate within the steroid binding domain, a dimerization sequence shown to be required for strong interaction of the steroid receptor with its response element and for transactivation of gene expression (34-36). Recently, Parker and co-workers (33, 34) have shown that a C-terminal region, which includes the mutation at amino acid 866, contains hydrophobic residues arranged in a heptad and conserved in all nuclear receptors. In vitro mutations in this region in the mouse ER blocked receptor dimerization, decreased DNA binding affinity and eliminated steroid binding. Thus, V866M may be defective in any one of a number of regulatory steps involved in steroid hormone action. Whereas the decreased but not absolute absence of biological function of AR mutant V866M may not appear to be consistent with the phenotype of complete AIS, one must take into account several additional factors such as: 1) whether the concentration of endogenous androgen in the developing fetus is sufficient to induce androgen-dependent musculinization if the AR mutation is present; 2) whether the presence of the mutation interfers in some way with the actions of other factors involved in androgen-stimulated gene transcription; and 3) whether the hormone response element within the MMTV-LTR promoter, which is promiscuous in the presence of AR, GR, or PR, is an accurate androgen response element to determine the specificity of androgen action (41-46). Whereas the direct action of testosterone or its more potent 5a-reduced metabolite, DHT, on transcription involves multiple nuclear proteins, the specificity of transcriptional activation by androgens most probably lies in the AR itself. Thus, it is not surprising that insensitivity to androgens arises from mutations in the AR, analogous to those recently shown to be responsible for vitamin D (47-49) and thyroid (50) resistant states. In this study, point mutations in the human AR gene steroid-binding domain have been definitively associated with functional defects in the AR proteins from human subjects with AIS. Whereas complete insensitivity to androgen is readily apparent in 46,XY subjects with a completely female phenotype as seen in this study, it is likely that other mutations within the AR gene lead to partial insensitivity with ambiguity of the external genitalia (1) and possibly even less severely affected phenotypes as in phenotypic men with azoospermia (2, 3). Finally, the occurrence of AIS might also arise from changes in other elements of the andro-  MOL END0,1990 1768  Vol 4 No. 12  MATERIALS AND METHODS  human AR cDNA sequence. We then subcloned a 1206-bp human AR cDNA fragment by insertion at its natural 5' -Hindi II site (nucleotide 2829) and ligated it to the BamHI site (nucleotide 4066) within the 3' -polylinker region of the vector, thus retaining unique internal Hindlll and EcoRI sites within the AR cDNA and an external 3' -BamHI site, these sites being convenient for subsequent subcloning of cDNA fragments containing specific point mutations in the human AR. We termed this new expression vector, p5HEBhAR-1. Preparation of these mutant ARs is described below and in Fig. 5.  Experimental Subjects  RNA Preparation, Northern Blots, and cDNA Synthesis  Informed written consent for genital skin biopsy or blood sample was obtained from each individual according to protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins Joint Committee for Clinical Investigation. Each affected subject with CAIS had a normal 46,XY karyotype with normal female external genitalia and absence of uterus and fallopian tubes. A short vagina ended in a blind vaginal pouch. Bilateral testes were located in the abdomen or in the labia majora but there were little or no Wolffian duct derivatives. Breast development occurred spontaneously at puberty and there was sparse to absent pubic and axillary hair despite blood testosterone concentrations in the normal adult male range. Androgen receptor binding assays in cultured human genital skin fibroblasts have been reported previously for all subjects included in this study (1, 11, 12, 18).  Total RNA was prepared from human genital skin fibroblasts by solubilization in 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate and centrifugation through a 5.7 M cesium chloride cushion, estraction with phenol and chloroform, and repeated precipitation with ethanol in the presence of potassium acetate (57). The poly(A+) RNA fraction was obtained by passing the crude RNA over two successive oligo-dT columns and ethanol precipitation (58). For Northern blot analyses (59), 2-3 µg poly(A+) RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose-1 .13% formaldehyde gel in 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mM sodium acetate, and 1 mM EDTA at 5 V/cm, transferred to nitrocellulose overnight in 20x SSC, and baked at 80 C for 2 h. The filter was wet briefly in deionized formamide and prehybridized at 42 C in a solution of 25 mM KP04 , pH 7.4, 5X SSC, 5X Denhart's, 50 µg/ml yeast tRNA, 50% formamide, and 10% dextran sulfate. Hybridization of RNA to human AR or chicken ~-actin cDNA probes was performed in the presence of 2-4 x 106 cpm random-primed 32P-labeled probe/ml hybridization solution at 42 C. The filters were washed twice for 15 min in 1x SSC/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at room temperature and twice for 15 min in 0.25X SSC/0.1 % SDS at room temperature and exposed to Kodak XOMAT film at -70 C with an intensifying screen. Poly (N) RNA (1 µg) was used to prepare single-stranded cDNA (60) with random hexamer priming following the protocol supplied with the Amersham cDNA Synthesis System Plus (Arlington Heights, IL). The 20-µI reaction volume was diluted 25-fold in TE, pH 7.5, and stored at 4 C. An aliquot of the cDNA pool (1 µI) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 25 pmol each human AR cDNA oligonucleotide primer designed to overlap the Hindlll and BamHI restriction sites (AR3 and AR6 of Fig. 4) in a 50 µI total reaction volume containing 200 µM each dNTP in reaction buffer (1 O mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.01% gelatin). The reaction mixture was denatured at 94 C for 5 min and cooled to 72 C. Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer/ Cetus, Emeryville, CA) (2.5 U) was added and a first cycle of amplification (94 C, 1 min; 56 C, 2 min; 72 C, 40 min) was followed by additional cycles of amplification (94 C, 40 sec; 56 C, 2 min; 72 C, 3 min) and a final extension at 72 C for 15 min. The amplified product was digested with Hindlll and BeymHI and purified on a 4% NuSieve GTG agarose (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) gel. The purified 1.2 kb AR cDNA fragment was ligated directly from the melted agarose into the Hindlll/BamHI sites of the p5HEBhAR-1 expression vector for transfection into competent HB101 cells. Colonies containing plasmid DNA were selected for growth on LB-ampicillin (200 µg/ml) agar plates. Five to 10 colonies were selected, inoculated into 5 ml liquid cultures of LB containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 C. Plasmid DNA was prepared by a modification of the alkaline miniprep method described by Maniatis et al. (61). For sequencing of double-stranded plasmid DNA, 2-3 µg purified DNA were denatured in 0.2 N NaOH at room temperature for 5 min and precipitated in the presence of 1 .5 M ammonium acetate by addition of ethanol at -80 C for 15 min. The DNA was collected by centrifugation, washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 7 µI water. The DNA was  gen-inducible transcription pathway, either in specific transcriptional factors (51, 52) or in the important target genes themselves. Presumably, each might have a unique clinical presentation that is not currently appreciated.  Cell Culture  Human genital skin fibroblasts were propagated in tissue culture from explants of normal male foreskin (46,XY control subjects) or a biopsy specimen from the labia major of 46,XY subjects with CAIS. Genital skin fibroblasts as well as CV-1 and COS-1 monkey kidney cells for DNA transfection experiments were maintained in minimal essential minimum (MEM) with Earle's salts and supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. AR Binding Assay  AR binding activity was determined in replicate culture dishes of DNA-transfected COS-1 cells by the procedure described previously for cultured human genital skin fibroblasts (40). For total AR binding, cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 C in the presence of 5 nM 3H-R1881 (87 Ci/mmol; methyltrienolone; New England Nuclear, Wilmington, DE) in MEM. For Scatchard analyses (53), COS-1 cells were incubated in an identical manner with a range of 3H-R1881 concentrations from 0.055.0 nM. The level of specific radiolabeled steroid binding was normalized for DNA content as measured by the method of Burton (54) and corrected for efficiency of DNA transfection according to the ~-galactosidase activity (55) in replicate plates ' of cells. Construction of Human AR Expression Vector  The full-length coding sequence of the human AR contained within a 3.1 kb Bg/11-BspHI (blunt) cDNA insert was cloned into the pCMV5 parent vector (56) at the Bg/11-Hindlll (blunt) sites (13). The complete human AR expression vector, termed p5HBhAR-A, contains the immediate early promoter region of the human cytomegalovirus promoter, human GH transcription termination and polyadenylation signal, the SV40 origin of DNA replication and early region enhancer sequences, the bacteriophage Fl origin of replication, an Escherichia coli gene encoding ampicillin resistance and a polylinker region (56). The p5HBhAR-A vector was subsequently modified to eliminate the EcoRI site (nucleotide 911) in the 5' -polylinker region thus retaining a now unique EcoRI site (nucleotide 3542) within the  1769  AR Functional Defect in AIS  initially sequenced following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer of the Sequenase kit (United States Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH) using human AR cDNA specific oligonucleotide primers (Fig. 5) to verify the presence in each selected plasmid of the altered base pair for the three affected human subjects. After identification of appropriate plasmid containing colonies, the entire Hindlll-BamHI human AR cDNA insert region was sequenced to eliminate the possibility that PCR induced nucleotide errors might be contained in the expression vector AR cDNA insert sequence or that more than one mutation might be contained within the AR gene of subjects with CAIS. Density Gradient Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis  Genomic DNA was prepared from cultured genital skin fibroblasts or blood leukocytes, as previously described (17). DNA (500 ng) was amplified by PCR as performed by Lubahn et al. (19) except that oligonucleotide primers for exons 4-8 were used at a final concentration of 1 µM and each 5' -oligonucleotide primer contained a 40-bp G-C clamp (5' GCCGCCCGCC GCCGCCCGCC GCCGCCGCCC GCCGCCCGCC 3') before the human AR specific 5' -primer sequence (62). Amplification conditions consisted of an initial denaturing step at 94 C for 5 min before addition of 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase followed by one cycle of 94 C, 2 min; 56-60 C, 2 min; and 72 C, 6 min; and 30 cycles of 94 C, 1 min; 56-60, 2 min; and 72 C, 3 min; with a final extension step at 72 C for 1O min. DNA products of the correct size were verified by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel at 100 V for 4 h. Amplified DNA fragments (10-µI reaction aliquot) were electrophoresed on a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel in T AE buffer with a 20-80% denaturant gradient (100% denaturant is 40% formamide/7 M urea) (62-64). Electrophoresis was carried out using a system designed by Green Mountain Lab Supply (Waltham, MA) with a 60 C recirculating TAE buffer bath for a total of 1300 V, h. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light to determine the relative mobility of each DNA fragment. In cases where exon-specific amplified DNA fragments from subjects with CAIS exhibited differential mobility on DGGE as compared to wild-type DNA fragments, the genomic DNA was reamplified by the PCR reaction but without the 40-bp G-C clamp oligonucleotide primer. Amplified DNA products were separated from oligonucleotide primers by centrifugation through a Centricon 30 microfiltration unit and directly sequenced (65, 66) with T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase, United States Biochemicals). Sequencing primers, the same as those used for the amplification reactions, were end-labeled with 'Y32P ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; New England Nuclear) using T. DNA polynucleotide kinase (Bethesda Research Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Approximately 80 ng PCR product were annealed with 10 ng appropriate 32 P-labeled sequencing primer in a volume of 11 µI on ice for 1O min. After heat denaturing for 5 min at 95 C, 2.5 µI annealed sample were added to four tubes with 3 µI sequencing mixture containing nonradioactive dNTPs at a concentration of 64 µl'yl, ddNTPs at a concentration of 6.2 µM and 2 U T7 DNA polymerase in buffer (25 mM TrisHCI, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgC'2, 70 mM NaCl, and 7 mM dithiothreitol). The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 C followed by the addition of 3 µI stop solution (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromophenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol FF). Samples were boiled for 3 min before loading 3 µI onto a 7% polyacrylamide/8 M urea gel. After electrophoresis at 60 W for 2-2.5 h, gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XOMAT film for 16 h at -70 C with an intensifying screen. Each sequence was verified by sequencing both the sense and antisense strands from two independent amplification reactions for each subject with AIS. Transient DNA Transfection  On the day before transfection, CV-1 or COS-1 monkey kidney cells were transferred to 1 00-mm culture dishes at a density  of 1 x 106 cells per dish. Two to 4 h before DNA transfection, 5 ml fresh MEM c,ontaining 20% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum were added to each culture dish. Cells were transfected with 30 µg total plasmid DNA consisting of 10 µg pCH11 O (gift from M. West, Johns Hopkins University), 10 µg MMTV-CAT (gift from L. Sanders, Johns Hopkins University), and 10 µg human wt or mutant AR in p5HEBhAR-1 or 10 µg control vector in 0.5 ml HBS (19 mM HEPES, pH 7.05, 0.14 M NaCl, 5 mM KCI, 0.7 mM Na2HPO., and 5.5 mM glucose) and 0.125 M CaC'2 by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (67). Cells were incubated in the presence of DNA for 4 h at 37 C after which the medium was removed. The cells were washed twice with 5 ml serum-free MEM, incubated for 1 min in HBS containing 15% glycerol (COS~ 1 cells) or 20% glycerol (CV-1 cells) and rinsed with 1 x HBS. Cells were incubated overnight in MEM supplemented with 5% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum. The next day, transfected cells from each group were detached from plates in PBS (0.15 M NaCl, 1 .15 mM KH2PO., 4.3 mM Na2HP04, 2.7 mM KCl)-EDTA (0.53 mM)trpysin (0.05%) and suspended in MEM-5% charcoal treated FBS and passaged to 100-mm culture dishes. These replicate culture dishes were incubated for 4 h at 37 C to allow cells to attach to the dishes before the addition of steroids in ethanol (<0.1%) to the medium. lmmunoblotting  COS-1 cells transiently transfected with the human AR cDNA expression vector were washed three times on ice with 5 ml PBS. Cells were directly solubilized by the addition of 300 µI hot (95 C) 2x electrophoresis sample buffer (0.125 M Tris-HCI, pH 6.8, 4% SOS, 20% glycerol, 1.4 M 2-mercaptoethanol). The viscosity of this cell lysate was reduced by the addition of 0.1 µg each of DNase and RNase. Samples were stored frozen at - 70 C until use. Electrophoresis was carried out in 7 .5% polyacrylamide gels containing 3.5 mM SOS according to the method of Laemmli (68), using a vertical polyacrylamide gel (1.5 mm thick, 14 cm wide, and 12.5 cm long) with a 1 cm stacking gel. Samples were boiled for 5 min before application of 50- to 75-µI aliquots in gels. Proteins were transferred from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose membrane filters by electrophoresis at 500 mA in 2.5 mM Tris, 0.19 M glycine at room temperature for 1.5 h. Nitrocellulose filters were preincubated (30 min) in 0.01 M Na2HPO., pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 containing 20 µg/ml SSA before incubation for 1 h with the affinity purified anti-peptide antibody (AR1-52) diluted 1:250 (11 µg/ml) in 0.01 M Na2HP04, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 (13). Filters were washed several times with buffer in the absence of additional protein and then incubated with buffer containing 20 µg/ml BSA and 1 µCi 1251-labeled protein A (8.29 µCifµg; New England Nuclear) for 1 h. Finally, the filter was washed with several changes of protein-free buffer. The washed filters were exposed to Kodak XOMAT film for 40-64 h at -70 C with an intensifying screen. Enzyme Assays  Cells transfected with plasmid DNA were washed three times with 5 ml ice-cold PBS and scraped on ice into 1 ml 0.04 M Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.15 M NaCl. Cells were collected by centrifugation (4 C, 2 min) in a microfuge and stored frozen at -70 C or immediately resuspended in 150 µI 0.25 M Tris-HCI, pH 7.8. The cell suspension was subjected to three cycles of freeze-thawing in dry-ice/ethanol for 5 min and 37 C for 5 min. The cell debris was pelleted in a microfuge (4 C, 5 min) and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The cellular extract was frozen at - 70 C and used for assay of t1-galactosidase or CAT activities. For t1-galactosidase (54), 30 µI cell extract were mixed with 1 ml reaction buffer (60 mM Na2PO.f40 mM NaH2PO., 1O mM KCI, 1 mM MgSO., 0.05 M t1-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0), and 0.2 ml substrate (2 mg/ml O-nitro-t1-o-galactopyranoside in 60  Vol 4 No. 12  MOL END0, 1990 1770  mM Na2 P0 4/40 mM NaH 2 P04). The reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 C until a faint yellow color was observed (1 h or less for COS-1 cells and 2-3 h for CV-1 cells). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml 1 M Na 2 C0 3 and the difference between the absorbance peak at 420 nm and the baseline at 550 nm was recorded. The 1J-galactosidase activity was used as a measure of DNA transfection efficiency and to normalize CAT and AR binding activities between culture dishes and treatment groups. For CAT activity, two separate assays were used. The first assay used 14C-chloramphenicol (dichloroacetyl-1,2-14C; 58.2 mCi/mmol; New England Nuclear) as substrate and resolved the acetylated 14-C products by TLC and subsequent autoradiography (69). The second assay used 3 H-acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-3 H; 2.5 Cijmmol; New England Nuclear) as the cofactor for acetylation of chloramphenicol in a two-phase partition liquid scintillation spectrophotometric method (70). In the former assay, 30 µI cell extract were combined with 0.1 µCi (1.7 µmol) 14 C-chloramphenicol, 0.5 M Tris-HCI, pH 7.8, and 0.53 mM acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) in a total volume of 150 µI and incubated at 37 C for 3 h. The reaction mixture was extracted with 500 µI ethyl acetate. A 400-µI aliquot of the organic phase was dried, resuspended, and chromatographed on silica gel thin-layer plates in CHCl 3 :methanol (90:10). The chromatogram was exposed to Kodak XOMAT film overnight at room temperature to visualize the acetylated products. For the quantitative assay of CAT activity by scintillation spectrophotometry, 30 µI cell extract were mixed in a scintillation counting vial with 1.25 mM chloramphenicol, 0.1 M TrisHCI, pH 7.8, and 0.1 µCi (40 pmol) 3 H-acetyl CoA in a total volume of 0.2 ml. The reaction mixture was overlaid with a 5 ml Betafluor (National Diagnostics, Sommerville, NJ) and placed into a scintillation spectrophotometer set for 0.5 min/ sample and automatic recycling for 6-10 cycles. The linear rate of CAT enzymatic activity was detected as the diffusion of 3 H-acetylated chloramphenicol into the organic scintillation cocktail. All samples generated a linear curve of enzymatic activity (r > 0.95) in this assay for at least 3 h (i.e. six or more counting cycles).  2.  3.  4.  5.  6. 7. 8.  9.  10. 11.  12.  13.

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 82:7889-7893  Mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) are thought to cause complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS) in 46,XY human subjects who have a female phenotype despite normal adult male concentrations of plasma testosterone. Assays of AR binding in cultured skin fibroblasts from subjects with CAIS show either an apparent absence of AR (AR-) or normal levels of AR (AR+) binding. In several subjects with CAIS, AR-, no gross AR mutation was detected by Southern blot analyses of genomic DNA and normal sized 10 kilobase mRNA was present on Northern blots of poly(A+) RNA from cultured genital skin fibroblasts. We have used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify individual exons within the human AR gene of subjects with CAIS and have identified point mutations in three subjects. In one AR- subject (R774C), amino acid 774 was changed from arginine (CGC) to cysteine (TGC), in another AR- subject (R831Q), arginine (CGA) was changed to glutamine (CAA) at position 831, and in an AR+ subject (V866M) a methionine (ATG) was substituted for valine (GTG) at position 866. Transfection of wild type and mutant AR cDNA clones into COS cells results in detection of AR protein by immunoblotting. AR ligand binding activity is absent in cells transfected with AR mutants R774C and R831Q, but present with AR mutant V866M. Androgen binding in cells transfected with AR mutant V866M has a 6-fold lower apparent binding affinity than that of wild-type AR. Transcriptional activation of the MMTV-CAT reporter gene was androgen dependent and specific and nearly maximal at physiological concentrations (10(-10) M) of androgen when wild-type AR was transfected into cells, whereas neither AR mutants R774C nor R831Q were able to stimulate CAT activity even at 10(-8) M androgen. AR mutant V866M was able to stimulate CAT activity but the androgen dose dependency was shifted toward pharmacological concentrations of steroid that exceed in vivo levels. The molecular basis of CAIS in humans exhibits genetic heterogeneity. Our study shows that some cases of CAIS are explained by an inability to form a functional AR-steroid complex and hence, the AR is unable to activate transcription of genes essential for male sex differentiation during fetal development."

The patient cohort included 46 Canadian CF families with well-characterized DNA marker haplotypes spanning the disease locus and several other families from Israel. Eleven mutations were found in the first NBF, 2 were found in the second NBF, but none was found in the R-domain. Seven of the mutations were of the missense type affecting some of the highly conserved amino acid residues in the first NBF; 3 were nonsense mutations; 2 would probably affect mRNA splicing; 2 corresponded to small deletions, including another 3-base-pair deletion different from the major mutation (AF508), which could account for 70% of the CF chromosomes in the population. Nine of these mutations accounted for 12 of the 31 non-AF508 CF chromosomes in the Canadian families. The highly heterogeneous nature of the remaining CF mutations provides important insights into the structure and function of the protein, but it also suggests that DNA-based genetic screening for CF carrier status will not be straightforward. The gene responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF) has recently been identified and the major mutation has been defined at the DNA level (1-3), providing a direct means for elucidating the basic defect in this disease and for giving an accurate genetic diagnosis. Sequence analysis of overlapping cDNA clones predicts a protein consisting of 1480 amino acids and containing membrane-associated regions and nucleotide (ATP)-binding folds (NBFs); this putative protein product has been named the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (2). The major mutation corresponds to a 3-base-pair (bp) deletion, which results in the loss of a phenylalanine residue at amino acid position 508 (AF508), within the first NBF (NBF1) of CFTR (2, 3). This mutation accounts for =70% of all CF chromosomes, and haplotype analysis suggests that all AF508 chromosomes are derived from the same origin (3-5). On the basis of DNA marker haplotype analysis, the remaining 30o of CF chromosomes are expected to be heterogeneous with respect to the nature of the mutations (3). Since each mutation marks a functionally important region of CFTR, it is expected that identification of additional mutations in the CF gene will provide useful information about the structure and function of the protein, in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease, and in development of pharmaceutical agents for better treatment of individuals with CF.

Since the major CF mutation occurs within the first NBF of CFTR, it is reasonable to assume that additional mutations might also be found within the two NBFs for the remaining 30% of CF chromosomes. In this communication, we report the result of a survey of the CF gene, in regions corresponding to the two NBFs and the R-domain of the protein, for the presence of additional mutations.  MATERIALS AND METHODS DNA Samples. The majority of CF families used in this study have been described (6). Extensive DNA marker haplotype information was available for the CF chromosomes in 46 Canadian families (3). A small number of additional CF families with unique geographic or ethnic backgrounds were included in the mutational screening; the ones reported here were recruited in the Chaim Sheba Medical Center in Israel. Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCRs). DNA sequences spanning individual exons were amplified by PCR with oligonucleotide primers located in the respective flanking introns. The general procedure for PCR has been described (7, 8). The specific oligonucleotide primers used for the amplification of individual exon sequences are listed in Table 1 (details of the intron/exon boundary sequences will be published elsewhere). All oligonucleotides were purchased from the Hospital for Sick Children DNA Biotechnology Service Center. Approximately 500 ng of genomic DNA from cultured lymphoblastoid cell lines or peripheral blood of each individual was used in each reaction. Typically, DNA samples were heated at 940C for 6 min and then subjected to 30 cycles of denaturation (940C for 30 sec), primer annealing (550C for 30 sec), and extension (720C for 60 sec) with 2.5 units of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase) (PerkinElmer/Cetus), followed by a final extension period of 7 min in a Perkin-Elmer/Cetus DNA thermal cycler. DNA Sequence Determination. Sequencing of cloned DNA was performed according to the dideoxynucleotide chaintermination method essentially as described (2, 9) with the Sequenase kit (United States Biochemical). The method for direct sequencing of PCR products was modified from published procedures (10) with either one of the PCR primers or Abbreviations: CF, cystic fibrosis; NBF, nucleotide (ATP)-binding fold; CFTR, CF transmembrane conductance regulator; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ASO, allele-specific oligonucleotide; PI, pancreatic insufficient; PS, pancreatic sufficient.  tPresent address: Department of Genetics, Hebrew University, Jerusalem 91904, Israel. 8447  8448  Medical Sciences: Kerem et al.

Allele-Specific Oligonucleotide (ASO) Hybridization. The oligonucleotide hybridization condition has been described (3). The normal and mutant specific oligonucleotides are listed in Table 2. Hybridization was performed at 37°C and the washings were done twice with 5x SSC (lx SSC = 0.15 M NaCl/0.015 M sodium citrate) for 10 min each at room temperature followed by two washings with 2x SSC for 30 min each at 45°C-57°C; the exact temperature was determined empirically for each ASO as indicated. Cloning of PCR Products. In one case (A1507), in which direct sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA did not allow unequivocal determination of nucleotide sequence alteration in the patient, cloning of the mutant allele was necessary. The two homoduplexes (94 and 97 bp) generated by PCR amplification of the genomic DNA from the father, who was found to contribute the mutant allele in question on the basis of hybridization analysis (data not shown), were purified from a 5% polyacrylamide gel and cloned into Bluescript KS vector (Stratagene). One clone, 5-3-15, was isolated by its lack of hybridization with the oligonucleotide N (3). The sequence obtained from this clone was in perfect agreement with that derived from direct DNA sequencing of the PCR products.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Initially, we had selected a small number of individuals rep-  resentative of different haplotype groups (3) for detection of unusual CF mutations, as we assumed that there were only a  Table 2.

Since, as the study continued, many more CF mutations had been discovered than previously anticipated, we included all the CF families (patients) with non-AF508 mutations in our study population. We also included several CF individuals whose DNA marker haplotypes were not determined. Detection of Mutations. Direct DNA sequencing for the genomic DNA regions spanning the two NBFs (exons 9-12 and 19-23) and the R-domain (exon 13) was performed for 29 individuals carrying 40 CF chromosomes with mutations other than AF508. The results are shown in Table 3. A total of 13 mutations were identified: 11 of them were located in the first NBF and 2 were in the second NBF, but none were in the R-domain. Two of these mutations, G551D (12) and W1282X (14), have been reported previously; 2 others, AI507 (M. Schwarz, C. Summers, L. Heptinstall, C. Newton, A. Markham, R. Cain, and M. Super, unpublished data) and 1717-1G -- A (16), have also been described by other investigators independently. Different lines of evidence indicate that the sequence alterations detected in this study were disease causing: (i)  Medical Sciences: Kerem et al.  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 (1990)  three of the changes (Q493X, G542X, W1282X) were nonsense mutations that predict production of truncated polypeptides; (ii) five of the missense mutations (A455E, S5491, S549R, G551D, R560T) occurred at highly conserved amino acid residues in the first NBF; (iii) two mutations altered the sequence at  splice junctions-one (1717-iG  -*  A) switched  the highly conserved AG (17) to AA, and the other (R560T), which was also a missense mutation, substituted AC for AG immediately upstream of the splice acceptor site, creating an alteration known to reduce efficiency of splicing (18); (iv) one mutation (3659delC) caused a single base-pair deletion that would result in a frameshift and premature termination; (v) one mutation (AI507) corresponded to a 3-bp deletion immediately upstream of the position for the phenylalanine codon deleted in AF508; (vi) two missense mutations (Y563N and P574H) would result in a drastic change ofthe encoded amino acids. Although the chromosomes carrying the various mutations described above were not fully sequenced to exclude the possibility of other coexisting alterations, as has been done for AF508, none of the changes were found among the normal chromosomes, some of which shared extensive DNA marker haplotype as the mutant chromosomes (data not shown). The absence of the same alterations in haplotypematched chromosomes for most mutations suggested that the sequence alterations were not polymorphisms. While the majority of the mutations described in this report (Table 3) appeared to be rare in the population, as only single cases were detected, two of the mutations, A455E and G551D, occurred more than once among the present Canadian chromosome population-two were detected for A455E and three were detected for G551D. In an earlier study, Cutting et al. (12) reported that 6 of 35 (17%) non-AF508 CF chromosomes screened carried the G551D mutation. Preliminary data from studies of other populations indicated that the G542X and S5491 mutations were also relatively abundant; for example, 5 of 59 (8.4%) non-AF508 CF chromosomes were found to carry G542X in the Jewish population in Israel and 1 of the CF Arabic patients was homozygous S5491. Together, these four mutations may account for 10-20o of the non-AF508 CF chromosomes. In addition to the mutations described above, we have detected three DNA sequence variations that occur on normal chromosomes: two of them, at nucleotide positions 1716 (G or A) and 2694 (T or G), do not appear to affect the  S23  8449  CF -j22  D7S  ~  A455E A455E  1  1  1 1  11  1 2 1 1 2 1  1 1  -  I  1  1  1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2  1  -  1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1  1  1  -  1  1 (lb) (lb)  -  3659delCI I I 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 W864X I 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 Y563N 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 1  2 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 - 1 2 1 1 1 -  2 2 (Ila)  A1507 Q439X R560T GS51D G551D GS51D  2 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2  2 2 2 1  1 2 1 1 2 - - 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 - I 1 2 - - 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 -I 1 2 2 1 2 1 1- 1 2 - I -  1 1 1 1 1 1  2 2(III) 1 1(HI) 2 2(III) 2 2(III)  P574H  2 1  2 1  1  1 1 2 2 1 1  1  1  1 1  1 1 1 1 1 1  2 1  1 2 2 1 2  -  1 1 1 1 1 1  2 2 2 2 2 2  2 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 -  1  (Ia)  1  1  1  2 (Ila)  2 2(II) I -(II) 1  1 (IV  FIG. 1.

DNA Marker Haplotype. Determination of the DNA marker haplotype associated with each of the mutations is important, not only in providing a reference for mutant classification but also in tracing the origins of mutations, thereby gaining insights into the possible cause for the high frequency of CF mutations in the Caucasian population. Our previous study showed that chromosomes carrying the AF508 mutation were derived from the same origin (3). To determine whether ancestral relationships existed among CF chromosomes carrying the other mutations, DNA marker haplotypes were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1, the chromosomes containing A455E and G551D share the same haplotypes for DNA markers spanning the CF gene, groups lb and III, respectively. The G551D chromosomes detected by Cutting et al. (12) also appear to have haplotype III. The A1507 mutation described here carries a group III haplotype (Fig. 1) and it is in good agreement with the partial haplotype data for another example of this mutation independently identified (M. Schwarz, C. Summers, L. Heptinstall, C. Newton, A. Markham, R. Cain, and M. Super, unpublished data). Therefore, these haplotype data suggest that CF chromosomes harboring the same mutation were probably derived from a common origin. Chromosomes within the same haplotype group, however, may harbor different mutations (e.g., those in groups Ila and or  Table 3.

Except for AF508 and A1507, most of the CF chromosomes screened were non-AF508 chromosomes. N represents the number of parental normal (non-CF) chromosomes examined. *These numbers are included for comparison (see refs. 3 and 13). G551D and W1282X have been reported previously (12, 14).  8450  Medical Sciences: Kerem et al.  III; Fig. 1). It is of interest to note that four different mutations have already been identified on CF chromosomes with haplotype III, which is infrequent among the N chromosomes (3). The number of mutations in the CF gene would therefore greatly exceed that predicted on the basis of haplotype analysis (3), as has been observed thus far. The extended DNA marker haplotypes were not determined for five of the CF mutations-namely, G542X, W1282X, S549R, S549I, and 1717-1G -* A-because the patients in whom these mutations were found were all recently recruited from Israel. The G542X mutation was first found in an Ashkenazic Jewish patient whose other CF chromosome was W1282X; S549R was discovered in a Moroccan-Jewish individual who also carried AF508; S549I and 1717-1G -* A were both first detected in Arabic patients. On the basis of ASO-hybridization and haplotype data, we previously suspected that one of the CF chromosomes with haplotype group III might carry a recurring AF508 mutation (3). Direct DNA sequence analysis, however, revealed that the mutation carried by this chromosome was AI507 (Table 3 and Fig. 1), differing from AF508 by a single nucleotide, A instead of T. The marked difference between haplotype III and haplotype Ia, which is associated with AF508, suggests that the two mutations are derived from different origins. Hot Spots for Mutations. There appeared to be a difference in distribution of mutations between the two NBFs-the number of mutations detected in the first NBF (exons 9-12) and 6 times that in the second NBF (exons 19-23). In addition, although the sample size is small, exon 11 seems to contain the most mutations (this study; ref. 12). It is possible that the first NBF, particularly the exon 11 region, is more critical for CFTR function. Alternatively, the DNA sequences encoding the first NBF may be relatively more unstable than other regions. The latter explanation is supported by two lines of observations. First, only two 3-bp deletions have so far been detected in the CF gene; both occur in the same region within exon 10. Second, several sequence alterations have been detected for the AGT codon for serine at position 549 in exon 11; while Cutting et al. (12) reported a change of this codon to AAT for asparagine (S549N), this study shows two additional mutations at this position-T to G transversion for S549R and G to T transversion for S549I. Implications in Protein Structure. Since no major deletion or rearrangement has been detected in CF, the discovery of nonsense, frameshift, and splicing mutations in the gene is surprising. It is also somewhat surprising that no mutation was found in the R-domain, a region that was thought to have a regulatory function (2). The only mutation reported for the region so far was a 2-bp insertion toward the end of this domain (19). The paucity of mutations in this region suggests that either the R-domain is not critical for function or mutations in this part of the protein cannot be tolerated. On the other hand, patients homozygous for nonsense (ref. 20; H. Cuppens, P. Marynen, C. De Boeck, F. Baets, E. Eggermont, H. Van den Berghe, and J. J. Cassiman, unpublished data) or splicing (data not shown) mutations have been detected, suggesting that total loss of CFTR function is not incompatible with life. The occurrence of AI507 and AF508 in the same region of the presumptive ATP-binding domain of CFTR is noteworthy. First, it is unclear which 3 bp were deleted in both cases (Fig. 2). In A1507, the deleted amino acid may be the isoleucine residue at position 506. Second, the amino acid residues involved, Phe-508 and Ile-507 (or Ile-506), are located in a polypeptide segment linking the two highly conserved regions believed to be the nucleotide contacting points (2, 22). Deletion of either one of the two amino acids is sufficient to disrupt the gene function. Furthermore, amino acid substitutions in this region have been found in two rare variants of normal chromosomes (with Phe-508 replaced by a cysteine and Ile-506  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 (1990)  replaced by a valine) without apparent loss of function of the protein (23). Therefore, the length of the polypeptide may be more important than the actual amino acid residues in this region for CFTR. Since the length of the linking segment varies among different ATP-binding proteins and the amino acid sequences are less conserved, the functional importance of Ile-507 and Phe-508 is probably unique to CFTR. Five of the missense mutations (A455E, S5491, S549R, G551D, R560T) occurred at amino acid residues highly conserved among the various NBFs from different proteins, suggesting that these residues are critical in ATP binding (2). The role of the two other missense mutations (Y563N, P574H) within the NBFs is not immediately apparent, although both mutations would drastically change the amino acid types. It is anticipated, however, that knowledge about these and other (12, 14, 19, 24) naturally occurring mutations will be an essential part in understanding the structure and function of the protein. In conjunction with development of three-dimensional structural analysis and tests for the biological activities of CFTR, it should be possible to define the role of each of these residues at the molecular level and, eventually, the function of the protein. Clinical Phenotype. Our previous studies (3, 25) showed that the pancreatic function of CF patients was at least in part predisposed by their genotypes at the CF locus. We hypothesized that CF mutations could be divided into two classesnamely, severe and mild (with respect to pancreatic involvement). Patients with two severe alleles are expected to be pancreatic insufficient (PI) and patients with one or two copies of mild alleles are pancreatic sufficient (PS). The AF508 mutation has been classified as a severe allele and, as expected, patients homozygous for AF508 are almost certainly PI (3, 13). To examine the clinical consequence of the mutations described in this report, the clinical status of each individual carrying these mutations was reviewed.

Identification of the A1507 and AF508 alleles. (Upper) The nucleotide sequence around the mutation sites. (Lower) Detecting the mutations by PAGE. The PCR products were prepared from the three family members and separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. A DNA sample from a known heterozygous AF508 carrier is included for comparison. The normal and mutant homoduplexes are poorly separated in this assay system because the PCR products are 491 and 488 bp long, respectively; however, the two sequences may be easily distinguished with shorter PCR products (11).  Medical Sciences: Kerem  et  al.  detected here (Q493X, A1507, 1717-1G -- A, G542X, S5491,  S549R, G551D, R560T, 3659delC, W1282X) were clearly associated with the PI phenotype and should, therefore, be classified as severe (as for AF508) according to our previous classification (3). It is of interest to note that several patients with both CF chromosomes carrying nonsense mutations (e.g., G542X) were reported to have relatively mild lung disease (although all PI as predicted) and that it was argued that truncation or total absence of CFTR might be associated with near normal lung function (ref. 20; H. Cuppens, P. Marynen, C. De Boeck, F. Baets, E. Eggermont, H. Van den Berghe, and J. J. Cassiman, unpublished data). Further studies are required to strengthen the latter argument, however, because good pulmonary condition has also been detected in a small number of patients homozygous for AF508 (13). Two of the mutations, A455E and P574H, were detected in PS patients. Since two PS patients with these mutations in our study population are heterozygous for AF508, it is reasonable to assume that A455E and P574H are both mild alleles. A455E was also detected in a PS patient with the other chromosome carrying an unknown mutation. The physiological consequence of Y563N could not be determined because it was found in a PS patient with a yet unclassified mutation in exon 14a (W864X; ref. 14). Obviously, additional case studies will be necessary to clarify the clinical consequences of carrying these potentially mild mutations. Moreover, we have found a substitution of cysteine for Phe-508 (F508C) in one patient who has typical symptoms of CF with PI, whereas the amino acid substitution has been found in at least two phenotypically normal individuals carrying the AF508 on their other chromosome 7 (23). It is possible that the F508C chromosome detected here carries an additional mutation causing the disease. Alternatively, there may be other genetic or environmental factors that contribute to disease severity. DNA Diagnosis. An immediate application for the information of the defined mutation sites is in CF diagnosis. For each identified mutation, however, it will be essential to devise an easy yet reliable screening procedure to confirm the observation and to estimate its frequency in various populations. We previously suggested that the unique mobility of the heteroduplexes formed between DNA fragments containing the normal and AF508 alleles is a rapid, nonradioactive method to detect carrier individuals (11). This method may also be applied to AI507; as shown in Fig. 2, the banding pattern of the PCR-amplified genomic DNA from the father, who is the carrier with A1507, is clearly distinguishable from that of the mother, who is typical of carriers with AF508. It has become clear that, although AF508 accounts for -70% of all CF chromosomes, the total number of diseasecausing mutations in the CF gene is likely to be large (refs. 12, 14, 16, 19, 24; this study and M. Schwarz, C. Summers, L. Heptinstall, C. Newton, A. Markham, R. Cain, and M. Super, unpublished data). In this study, while we have fully analyzed >46% (2055/4440) of the coding region of the 31 non-AF508-carrying chromosomes in the Canadian family  collection for which the DNA marker haplotypes have been determined (3), the mutations identified only account for 12 of these chromosomes (38%). Therefore, DNA-based population screening for CF carriers will be complicated by the existence of a large number of different mutant alleles, especially since some of them are expected to have markedly different geographical (ethnic) distributions (4, 5, 12). It is perhaps also important to point out the pitfalls of some of the common means of DNA diagnosis. For example, both S549N (12) and S5491 (this study) destroy the same Dde I site; although both of them are disease-causing mutations in this instance, the destruction of a restriction enzyme recognition site is obviously not a reliable method to define a particular mutation. ASO hybridization may also give false results;  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 (1990)  8451  A1507 could be mistaken as AF508 under low hybridization stringency (ref. 3; this study). Allele-specific PCR has been developed for AF508 (15) and several mutations described here (Q493X, S549R, and 3659delC); this method usually works well but it requires very careful temperature control to distinguish different sequences. These examples illustrate that extreme caution should be used with any DNA testing procedure; testing of a large number of normal chromosomes, particularly those of the same haplotypes, and quality control should be mandatory before any broad-scale screening is implemented. Furthermore, it has been suggested that broadscale population screening for CF carriers should not begin until at least 95% of the mutations have been identified (21).

"1","Germ-line transmission of a mutated p53 gene in a cancer-prone family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.Tumour suppressor genes, whose usual function seems to be controlling normal cell proliferation, have been implicated in many inherited and sporadic forms of malignancies Much evidence supports the concept of tumour formation by loss-of-function mutations in suppressor genes, as predicted by the two-hit model of Knudson and DeMars. The suppressor gene, p53, is affected in such a manner by numerous mutations, which occur in a variety of human tumours. These mutations usually represent the loss of one allele and the substitution of a single base in the other. We have now analysed the p53 gene in a family affected by Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by the occurrence of diverse mesenchymal and epithelial neoplasms at multiple sites. In some instances the neoplasms seem to be related to exposure to carcinogens, including ionizing radiation. The Li-Fraumeni family that we studied had noncancerous skin fibroblasts (NSF) with an unusual radiation-resistant phenotype. DNA derived from the NSF cells of four family members, spanning two generations, had the same point mutation in codon 245 (GGC----GAC) of the p53 gene. This mutation leads to substitution of aspartic acid for glycine in one of the regions identified as a frequent target of point mutations in p53. The NSF cell lines with the mutation also retained the normal p53 allele. This inherited p53 mutation may predispose the members of this family to increased susceptibility to cancer."

To identify the molecular lesion in G6PD Canton we have sequenced the G6PD gene from an affected individual by PCR amplification of exons followed by M 13 cloning and dideoxynucleotide sequencing as described previously (2). The entire coding sequence was determined. Only one base difference from the wild type sequence G6PD B (3) was found; this was a G- T change at position 1376 resulting in the substitution of leucine for arginine at amino acid position 459. The change of basic to uncharged amino acid is consistent with the electrophoretic fast mobility of G6PD Canton. This arginine residue is not conserved in G6PD molecules from yeast and drosophila but it lies between two blocks of highly conserved amino acids (4, 5).  REFERENCES 1.

Worton* *Genetics Department and Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children, and the Departments of Medical Genetics and Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto; and TDivision of Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto  Summary Partial gene deletion is the major cause of mutation leading to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Partial gene duplication has also been recognized in a few cases. We have conducted a survey for duplication in 72 unrelated nondeletion patients, analyzed by Southern blot hybridization with clones representing the entire DMD cDNA. With careful quantitative analysis of hybridization band intensity, 10 cases were found to carry a duplication of part of the gene, a frequency of 14% for nondeletion cases (10/72), or 6% for all cases (10/181). The extent of these duplications has been characterized according to the published exon-containing HindIII fragment map, and in six of the 10 duplications a novel restriction fragment that spanned the duplication junction was detected. The resulting translational reading frame of mRNA has been predicted for nine duplications. A shift of the reading frame was predicted in four of the six DMD cases and in one of the two intermediate cases, while the reading frame remained uninterrupted in both BMD cases. RFLP and quantitative Southern blot analyses revealed a grandpaternal origin of duplication in four families and grandmaternal origin in one family. In all five families, the duplication was found to originate from a single X chromosome. Unequal sisterchromatid exchange is proposed to be the mechanism for the formation of these duplications. Introduction  Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common and severe neuromuscular disease in man. It occurs with an incidence of about 1/3,300 male births and has an X-linked recessive mode of inheritance. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is a clinically less severe form of the dystrophy, and it is allelic to DMD (for review, see Worton and Thompson 1988). The cloning of the DMD gene and the identification of its protein have made it possible to characterize mutations of the gene at both the DNA and protein level. So far, the majority of the detectable mutations at this Received September 13, 1989; revision received November 16, 1989. Address for correspondence and reprints: Dr. R. G.

Deletions are not uniformly distributed throughout the gene, and two deletion-rich regions have been identified (Koenig et al. 1987; Darras et al. 1988; Wapenaar et al. 1988; Baumbach et al. 1989; Gillard et al. 1989). There is no apparent correlation between the size of the deletion and the severity of the disease, and sequences deleted in DMD patients may also be deleted in BMD patients (Hart et al. 1987; Liechti-Gallati et al. 1987; Davies et al. 1988). However, deletions identified in most DMD patients were predicted from sequence analysis to have shifted the translational reading frame, whereas deletions identified in most BMD patients have maintained the reading frame (Malhotra et al. 1988; Monaco et al. 1988; Baumbach et al. 1989; Gillard et al. 1989),  Duplication Mutation at the DMD Locus thus providing an explanation for the phenotypic differences in most deletion patients. Duplication of part of the DMD gene has also been revealed in a few patients. These duplications were identified by probing the patients' DNA with both genomic probes (Bertelson et al. 1986; den Dunnen et al. 1987; Hu et al. 1988) and cDNA probes (Greenberg et al. 1988; Hu et al. 1988). However, an extensive study on duplication similar to that carried out with deletion has not been described. In the present report, we present our findings on the systematic study of gene duplication in 72 unrelated DMD and BMD patients in whom no deletion of any exon was found. We report the frequency of duplication, the pattern of its distribution, and the genotype/phenotype comparison (i.e., frameshift vs. in-frame duplication, as compared with severity of the disease). We also report the origin of duplication in two families, results which, when combined with those for three other families previously reported by us, suggest a preferential male origin of the  duplication. Subjects and Methods Patients Eleven boys, two of whom were brothers, were found to have duplications. All have been followed for several years in the Muscular Dystrophy Clinic of the Hospital for Sick Children. The diagnosis of DMD or BMD was based on clinical findings including grossly elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) activity, pseudohypertrophy of the calf muscles, electromyographic abnormalities characteristic of myopathy, muscle biopsy findings consistent with muscular dystrophy, the patient's age when the diagnosis was made, and the progression of muscle weakness. Patients in this study were classified as DMD if they became wheelchair-bound before the age of 12 years and as BMD if still ambulant at age 16 years. Patients who became wheelchair-bound at ages of 12-16 years were classified as intermediate phenotype. The patients were also evaluated for disease severity by using a numerical scale which divides the disease severity into five categories: 1 = severe DMD; 2 = milder DMD; 3 = intermediate; 4 = severe BMD; 5 = milder BMD (Gillard et al. 1989). Four patients under the age of 16 years were also classified for disease phenotype by comparing the clinical findings with those of members of each class at a similar age. The phenotypic classification of the 11 patients is shown in table 1. Nine of the 11 patients are isolated cases with no  683  family history, and the other two (HSC935 and HSC1511) are affected brothers with no other family history. CK activity has been measured in mothers of seven isolated cases. Five mothers (for patients HSC627, 1045, 1337, 1417, and 1575) had an elevated CK level and thus are presumptive carriers; in two isolated cases (HSC689 and HSC679) the mother's CK level was normal, but since the sister of HSC689 had an elevated CK level, the mother is also considered a presumptive carrier. Probes The XJ (DXS206) probes and the cDNA probes (cdnal and cdna5) that detect the first 20 exons of the gene were isolated in our laboratory (Ray et al. 1985; Thompson et al. 1986; Burghes et al. 1987). Additional cDNA probes (cDNA4-5a, cDNASb-7, cDNA8, and cDNA9-14) from Dr. L. M. Kunkel's laboratory were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, and other genomic probes were gifts from Drs. L. M. Kunkel (the pERT probes [DXS164], J-Bir[DXS270], and 99-6 [DXS41]), G. J. B. van Ommen (754 [DXS84] and P20 [DXS269]), J. L. Mandel (C7 [DXS28]), and K. E. Davies (OTC). The cloning of these probes has been described elsewhere (Aldridge et al. 1984; Davies et al. 1985; Dorkins et al. 1985; Hofker et al. 1985; Monaco et al. 1985, 1987; Koenig et al. 1987; Wapenaar et al. 1988). Southern Blot and Densitometric Scanning Analyses  DNA used in the present study was extracted from blood leukocytes or from the lymphoblastoid cell lines of patients, their family members, and normal individuals. DNA concentrations were quantified using a spectrophotometer and also by monitoring the intensity of ethidium bromide staining on a test gel. DNA close to equal amounts was used in each lane in order to determine the dosage difference of hybridization band intensity. The DNA was digested to completion with the appropriate restriction enzyme, separated on 0.6%0.8% agarose gel by electrophoresis, and transferred to Hybond-N.m membrane (Amersham). The membranes were hybridized with 32P-dCTP random-primed DNA probes (Feinberg and Vogelstein 1983). The autoradiographic film was scanned using a transmission densitometer (computing densitometer model 300A; Molecular Dynamics). The area under each peak (peak value) (see fig. 3) represents the intensity of each hybridization band. The peak area was divided by the total peak area of all bands in that sample lane to ob-  684  Hu et al.

Owing to the fact that the bands with double (duplication patient) or triple (duplication carrier) intensity increase the total peak area and therefore alter the relative peak value, a normalization factor is required. To obtain the normalization factor for a duplication patient, the bands showing single intensity in a normal male and similar intensity in the duplication case were selected; and the ratio of mean peak values of these bands for the normal male and for the duplication case provides the appropriate normalization factor. All the relative peak values from the duplication case were then multiplied by this factor. To obtain the normalization factor for a duplication carrier, the bands showing single intensity in a normal male and double intensity in the duplication carrier were selected. For the normal male and the duplication carrier the ratio of mean peak values of these bands (i.e., the normalization factor). was obtained by dividing the mean peak value of the normal male with half the mean peak value of the carrier. All the relative peak values from the carrier were then multiplied by this factor. Because the hybridization band intensity is estimated according to the ratio of the intensity of each band to that of all bands in  the same sample lane, the results are not affected by variation of DNA quantities. Multiple exposure of the autoradiographic film was used to ensure the appropriate linear intensity response of all the hybridization bands. Results  Gene Duplication  Ten of the 72 unrelated nondeletion patients were found to have partial gene duplication. This was shown by probing the patients' DNA, digested with HindIII and EcoRI, respectively, with clones representing the entire DMD cDNA. In each of the 10 cases, one or more exon-containing fragments corresponding to a set of contiguous exons hybridized with double intensity, indicating the duplication of these exons. Patient HSC935 and his elder brother HSC1511 both were classified as BMD and were found to carry an identical duplication of exons 2-7. Two restriction enzymes were used in the analysis to avoid ambiguous results due either to the small size of some exon-containing fragments or to comigrating fragments and to confirm any duplication results obtained. DNA from a normal male  Duplication Mutation at the DMD Locus  68S  and a normal female was used as the hybridization intensity standard. All blots were reprobed using a genomic probe known to reside outside the gene, in order to avoid miscalculation of the band intensity due to possible variation in loading of DNA. The HindIII fragments that contain the duplicated exons as well as the cDNA probes used to detect these duplications are summarized in table 1 and figure 1. Four of the 10 duplications (HSC627, 678, 689, and 1575) had previously been recognized using genomic probes and were later confirmed with cDNA probes (Hu et al. 1988, 1989). These four cases are included in the present report for the purpose of phenotype/genotype comparison as well as for calculating the duplication frequency. Examples of Southern blot analysis for the six new duplications are shown in figure 2. The duplication of specific bands was confirmed by scanning the autoradiographic film by using a transmission densitometer. The scanning results are in agreement with the visual observation. An example of the densitometric analysis for the duplication case HSC1417 and his family is shown in figure 3 and table 2. In six of the 10 duplications, an altered-size restriction fragment was detected (figs. 1, 2B, 2C, and 4). We believe that in each case this fragment contains the duplication junction (Hu et al. 1988), since it was detected in the presence of all the normal size fragments, was only detected with a probe close to the junction (i.e., cdnal Patient #I T.R.F.

Therefore, it is unlikely that this novel fragment either represents a polymorphic allele or results from other types of DNA rearrangements such as deletion or insertion, since with a deletion one or more bands would be missing and with an insertion the presence of two, instead of one, novel fragments is the most likely outcome (see Discussion for details). The identification of the same novel fragment in carrier mothers and sisters but not in other individuals of the family further confirmed that the altered-size fragment segregates with the duplication, a result consistent with a duplication junction fragment (fig. 4; data not shown). Frameshift and In-Frame Duplications  It is known that some exons of the DMD gene do not contain an integral number of triplet codons (Koenig et al. 1988; Malhotra et al. 1988; Baumbach et al. 1989; Koenig et al. 1989), and duplication or deletion of a DNA segment containing such an exon would be expected to cause a shift of the translational reading frame of the mRNA. Because the intron/exon boundaries of parts of the DMD gene as well as the nucleotide sequence of the entire DMD cDNA have been determined, the resulting translational reading frame can cDNA4-5a  WO 00 ° o o °. ° .  .f .  q  °r--  . .

The size of the exon-containing fragments (in kilobases) is shown on the right side of the autoradiograph. The duplicated bands (indicated by asterisks) in the patients all show an intensity similar to that of the same bands in the normal female, while the rest of their bands show an intensity equal to that of the same bands in the normal male, indicating duplication of these bands in the patients.

All filters were reprobed with a genomic probe, 99-6 (Aldridge et al. 1984), known to flank the gene, and the corresponding band of 5.3 kb is indicated as a control band, (C), at the bottom. 687  Hu et al.  688 Table 2 Hybridization Intensity in Duplication Case HSC1417 Family RELATIVE BAND INTENSITY  HYBRIDIZATION BAND  46XY Patient Mother Sister Grandfather Grandmother 46XX  8.2 kb (A)a .......... 7.8 kb (B) ........... 4.1 kb (C) .......... 3.3 kb (D) .......... .. 3.1 kb (E) 2.9 kb (F) ...........  .  92 1.10 .96 .94 .91 .73  2.12 1.04 2.35 1.00 1.01 .82  2.84 1.89 3.31 2.06 2.06 2.30  2.79 1.80 3.30 2.08 2.02 2.37  .87 1.04 .99 .92 1.10 .88  2.17 2.07 1.88 1.72 1.99 2.13  2.02 1.82 2.03 2.15 2.22 2.19  NOTE.-The autoradiographic film in fig.

In four of the nine duplications (cases 627, 679, 1045, and 1337) in which we have predicted the reading frame, the junction can be detected with cDNA probes, and this raised the possibility that the junction might lie within an exon. However, we were able to show that in each case the junction does not lie within an exon, since at least one of three restriction enzymes (HindIII, EcoRI, and BglII) gave a normal restriction-fragment pattern (Koenig et al. 1987; Hu et al. 1988; Darras and Francke 1988; authors' unpublished data) with no junction fragment (figs. 2A and 2F; data not shown). In addition, we confirmed the extent of the duplication in the two cases: in case 627 by showing with an exon 20-specific subclone that the junction fragment contains exon 20 and in case 679 by probing patient DNA with two probes -J-Bir and a subfragment of cDNA 5b-7 -flanking the duplicated region (Gilgenkrantz et al. 1989; authors' unpublished data); both probes detect single intensity bands on HindIl-digested DNA with no junction fragment. Recently, muscle specimens from two ofthe duplication patients (HSC627 and HSC1337) have been analyzed with western blotting technique using antibodies directed against the DMD protein, dystrophin. On the basis of DNA analysis, both of these duplications had been predicted to have a shift of the reading frame and were therefore predicted to produce a prematurely truncated protein. Western blot analysis showed that a smaller protein with the predicted molecular weight could be detected in both cases (D. E. Bulman, E. G. Murphy, E. E. Zubrzycka-Gaarn, R. G. Worton, and  689  Duplication Mutation at the DMD Locus P. N. Ray, personal communication). Because of the difficulty in obtaining muscle samples, we have not been able to apply western blot analysis to other duplications. Origin of Duplication We have previously traced the origin of duplication to the maternal grandfather in three of the families of the patients summarized here (patients HSC627, 689, and 1575). We have now determined the origin in two of the three additional 3-generation families (probands HSC679, 1337, and 1417). In the three families, the mother and the proband were found to carry the same duplication, as shown by the triple (mother) and double (patient) intensity of the same exon-containing fragments detected in their DNA (figs. 3 and 5; data not shown) and also, in two cases (HSC679 and 1337), by the detection of an identical duplication junction fragment in the patient and his mother (fig. 4B; data not shown). This indicates that in each case the mother is a carrier of the duplication and that she has transmitted the chromosome carrying the duplication to her son and, in one case (HSC1417), to her daughter as well. The maternal grandparents of two patients (HSC1337 and 1417) were shown not to carry the duplication in their somatic cell (leukocytes) (figs. 4B and 5), and therefore in these two families the duplication most likely arose in the germ line of one of the maternal grandparents. In the family of HSC679, the maternal grandmother was found to carry the duplication in her somatic cells (data not shown). Therefore, it is not possible to trace the origin of the duplication in this family. In order to determine in which grandparent the duplication arose, RFLP analysis was carried out using probes within and flanking the DMD gene. As can be seen in figure 6, several intragenic as well as flanking markers were informative in both families, indicating a >99% probability that the maternal grandfather's X chromosome was inherited by the proband HSC1337 and that one of the maternal grandmother's X chromosomes was inherited by the proband HSC1417. Discussion  Partial gene duplication has recently been recognized as one type of molecular defect leading to a genetic disease. To our knowledge, this has only been demonstrated in two individuals with a genetic disease other than DMD or BMD. In one case (Lehrman et al. 1987), a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia was found to be a compound heterozygote with two different mutant alleles of the LDL (low-density lipoprotein) recep-  B  A  -  8.2* 7.8  OQ  -40.0 7.0* -  3.8 3.7*  -  - 3.1.  -3.3  _ 3.1  -  5.3(C)  -2.9  -5.3(C)  Figure 5 A, Southern blot analysis of the case HSC1417 family. DNA was digested with HindIII and hybridized with a cDNA probe cdna la (Burghes et al. 1987). Two bands (8.2 kb and 4.1 kb) (indicated by asterisks) in the patient show an intensity similar to that of the same bands in the normal female (46,XX), while the rest of his bands show an intensity equal to that of the same bands in the normal male (46,XY). This indicates the duplication of these two bands in this patient. These two bands in the mother and sister of the patient show an intensity approximately triple the single intensity of the same bands in the normal male or 1.5 times the intensity of the double intensity bands in the normal female, while other bands in these females show the normal double intensity. This confirms that the mother and sister of the patient are carriers of the duplication. Their carrier status was first suggested by elevated CK level. The duplication (patient) and triplication (mother and sister) of the 8.2-kb band can best be appreciated by a change of the ratio of intensity in this band and the 7.8-kb band. This ratio is approximately 1:2 in the normal individuals but has been changed to 1.1 in the patient and in his mother and sister. The triplication of these bands has been confirmed by densitometric analysis. All bands in the maternal grandparents show an intensity similar to that in normal individuals, indicating that they do not carry such a duplication in the somatic cells. B, Southern blot analysis of the case HSC1337 family. DNA was digested with HindIII and hybridized with the cDNA probe cDNA8 (Koenig et al. 1987). Three bands (7.0 kb, 3.7 kb, and 3.1 kb) (as indicated by asterisks) in the patient show an intensity similar to that of the same bands in the normal female (46,XX), while the rest of his bands show an intensity equal to that of the same bands in the normal male (46,XY), indicating duplication of these bands in this patient. These bands in the mother of the patient show an intensity approximately triple the single intensity of the same bands in the normal male or 1.5 times the intensity of the double intensity of these bands in the normal female. This confirmed the carrier status of this mother, which had been suggested earlier by elevated CK level. The detection of an identical junction fragment in the patient and his mother further confirmed her carrier status (fig. 2B). Both the maternal grandparents have normal intensity bands, and no junction fragment is detected in them, indicating that they do not carry the duplication in their somatic cells. A control band (C) of 5.3 kb is shown at the bottom of both autoradiographs and is detected by the flanking probe 99-6 (Aldridge et al. 1984).  I-  837  2  '14  12  16- l12  ~~  1 2 132 -22  '2.8 '8.7 1 ||  -  12  12-  III.  72,6 -1.3  -1.6 -7.5  *14- -12 ~12- -16  s ~ ~~~31 4  13- -22 2.8- -1.6 8.7- -7.5 14- -12 12- -16  13- -22  13 1.67.5-  2.8- -1.6 8.7- -7.5  12-  14- -12  12-  12- -16  132 probe 99-6 pERT87-15 pERT87-1 pERT87-1 754  * 2.81 * 8.7 *14 12  226.8-  301  3.3-  1.  7.8-1 161 6.6  1  2  Enzyme  RFLPs(kE  Pst 1 Xmn 1 Xmn 1 EcoR V Pst 1  22/13 2.8/1.6 8.7/7.5 14/12 16/12  13- -22 3.5- -6.8 8.01 -30  3.5- 3.5'  6.4- -6.4* 6  1.2-1k 6.2'  6.6  Probe 99-6 P20 pERT87-30 pERT87-15 XJ 2.3 754 OTC  Enzyme Pst 1 Msp 1 Bgl 11 Taq 1 Taq 1 Pst 1 Msp 1  RFLPs (kb) 22,13 6.8, 3.5 30, 8.0 3.5, 3.3 7.8, 6.4 16, 12 6.6, 6.2  13-I IL 6.8303.36.412 6.6  Ill. -22 22--13 13 --22 -6.8 6.8-113.5 -6.8 30 -30 -30 8.01 -8.0 3.5 -3.5 3.5 * 3.3- 3.5 * 6.4 -6.4 * d 6.46.4- 6.4 122 12 16 12 16 6.6 6.2 6.2* 6.6 6.2 * Figure 6 A, RFLP analysis of the case HSC1337 family.

This duplication mutant allele produced an elongated LDL receptor with severely reduced binding capacity for LDL. The other case was a patient with LeschNyhan syndrome, an X-linked recessive disease, in whom it was shown that two of the nine exons of the HPRT (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase) gene are duplicated (Yang et al. 1984). The duplication mutant gene produced an mRNA with increased size consistent with the size predicted on the basis of DNA analysis, and the resulting enzyme (HPRT) had no measurable activity (Wilson et al. 1986). Evidence of gene duplication in the DMD locus was first provided by Bertelson et al. (1986), who reported a DMD patient with a double intensity hybridization band detected with the intragenic genomic probe, pERT87-15. Subsequently, den Dunnen et al. (1987) detected a double intensity band with an intragenic genomic probe, J-Bir, and with the field-inversion gel electrophoresis technique. We had conducted a survey for duplication in 120 unrelated DMD and BMD patients (Hu et al. 1988). Using a limited number of genomic probes and a cDNA probe that detects the first 16 exons of the gene, we detected three duplications plus nine deletions in these patients. Because the probes used in that survey covered only about one quarter of the gene, the frequency of duplication (as well as deletion) was known to be underestimated. As well, it was recognized that the relative frequency of duplication versus deletion might not be accurate. The use of cDNA probes of the entire DMD gene was necessary in order to obtain accurate estimates of the frequency of duplication and deletion as well as the ratio of the two. Recently, Gillard et al. (1989) in our laboratory have completed a study of deletion in 181 unrelated DMD and BMD patients including the 120 cases mentioned above. Southern blot analysis was carried out by using probes representing the entire DMD cDNA, and 109 deletions were found. With the same approach, we have searched for duplications in the remaining 72 nondeletion patients, and 10 duplications were identified. The estimated frequency of deletion (60%) is about 10 times higher than that of duplication (6%). It is apparent that this is mainly due to the existence of the deletion-rich region defined by (a) the last four exoncontaining HindIII fragments (ECHFs) detected by cDNA probe Sb-7 and (b) all the ECHFs detected by cDNA probe 8 (Baumbach et al. 1989; Gillard et al. 1989). More than two-thirds of our deletions (80/109) (Gillard et al. 1989) but less than one-third of our duplications (3/10) were found in this region (table 1 and  691  fig. 1), i.e., with at least one endpoint contained within this region. When deletions and duplications found in this region are excluded, the remaining deletions (29) are still four times more frequent than duplications (7). There are at least two possibilities that may contribute to the much higher frequency of deletion. First, even though unequal chromatid exchange would be expected to generate deletion as well as duplication with equal frequency (Weatherall and Clegg 1979; Vogel and Motulsky 1986), other mechanisms may also exist that can only produce deletion. In fact, many deletions found in other genetic diseases appear not to result from unequal chromatid exchange but rather to be generated from a single chromatid (Vanin et al. 1983; Lehrman et al. 1985; Nicholls et al. 1987). This type of intrachromatid deletion would not be expected to be a mechanism for generating duplication. It may be reasonable to assume that most deletions in the deletionrich region described above resulted not from unequal chromatid exchange but by a mechanism producing only deletion, since far more deletions than duplications were found in this region (over 25 times more). Second, duplications may not always be stably inherited, in that the duplicated region may undergo spontaneous deletion. There are two recent reports supporting this hypothesis. In one case (Yang et al. 1988), the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts from a Lesch-Nyhan patient with a partial duplication of the HPRT gene were found to have undergone spontaneous deletion of the duplicated region. In the second case (Gitschier 1988), a female was found to carry three different X chromosomes in her germ-line cells: a deletion of part of the factor VIII gene, a duplication of part of the factor VIII gene, and a normal copy of the gene. Because both the deletion and duplication mutations had arisen on the same X chromosome and because cloning and restriction-mapping results were not consistent with a reciprocal event for the generation of the deletion and duplication, it was suggested that the duplication might be a precursor to the deletion. It also remains a possibility that some duplications and deletions in the DMD gene may not cause disease phenotype. If so, the true ratio of deletion versus duplication could be different from that observed in the patients. Tandem duplication of a DNA sequence creates a duplication junction flanked by two segments of DNA which are normally separated in the genome. Therefore, the detection of a single duplication junction fragment can be taken as strong but not unequivocal evidence that the duplication is of tandem organization. The cloning of the duplication junction and the map-  692  ping of both ends of the duplicated region in two of our duplications (HSC627 and 689) have confirmed the tandem organization of these duplications (authors' unpublished data). We know from the literature that tandem duplication of DNA sequences can be generated by two mechanisms, namely, unequal chromatid exchange and DNA slippage. The latter has been found to be involved in short DNA motifs (probably less than 10 bp) (Dover 1989). In our cases the duplicated region is large (100 kb or larger), and therefore the DNA slippage mechanism is unlikely the one. The insertion of DNA, which would create two junctions at the site of insertion (Gitschier 1988; Kazazian et al. 1988), can also generate a duplicate copy on a chromatid, but the chance for the duplicated copy to be arranged in tandem with the original copy would be expected to be very low and therefore is less likely the mechanism here. Deletions appear to occur with approximately equal frequency in DMD and BMD (Forrest et al. 1987; Hart et al. 1987). Sequences deleted in DMD patients may also be deleted in BMD patients, and the size of deletion does not appear to correlate with the severity of the disease. It has been proposed (Monaco et al. 1988) that DMD may result largely from frameshift deletions while BMD usually results from deletions that maintain the translational reading frame. The same hypothesis has also been proposed for duplication (Hu et al. 1988). Studies carried out with deletions showed that, though exceptions exist, the reading-frame hypothesis holds true for most deletions (Malhotra et al. 1988; Monaco et al. 1988; Baumbach et al. 1989; Gillard et al. 1989; Koenig et al. 1989). In the present study, frameshift duplication accounts for four of the six DMD cases and for one intermediate case while in-frame duplication accounts for two BMD cases in addition to one intermediate and two DMD cases (table 1), suggesting that this hypothesis in general also holds true for duplications. An exception to the reading-frame hypothesis is the in-frame duplication of exons 3 and 4 that results in two cases with severe phenotypes (one DMD and one intermediate). This is especially noteworthy since in two cases a larger in-frame duplication of exons 2-7, which spans the smaller duplication of exons 3 and 4, gave rise to the milder BMD (table 1 and fig. 1). At this point we do not have an explanation for this unusual finding, but we suspect that this might be due to structural differences of the resulting proteins. It has been reported that dystrophin and alpha-actinin share their greatest similarity over a putative actin-binding N-terminal region that corresponds to about amino acids 14-240 of dystro-  Hu et al.  phin, and this domain covers exons 2-8 (Hammonds 1987; Koenig et al. 1988). Therefore, the duplication of exons 2-7 results in the duplication of almost the entire putative actin-binding domain. As a result, the structure and function of this domain might be partially preserved. The duplication of exons 3 and 4, on the other hand, results in the duplication of only part of this domain, and this may lead to a severe disruption of the structure - and therefore of the function - of this domain. However, since the function of dystrophin has not been definitively determined, the above explanation remains only a speculation. The duplication of specific exons provided a marker to study the origin of the mutation. In conjunction with RFLP haplotype analysis, the chromosome that carries the duplication can be assigned specifically to the family member in whom the duplication originated. Such analyses were carried out in the present study with two families in which the affected boy and his mother both carried a duplication while the grandparents did not. In one family (HSC1337) it was found that the maternal grandfather's X chromosome was transmitted to the proband (fig. 6A). Since the grandfather neither carries the duplication in his somatic cells (leukocytes) nor shows any sign of this disease, the duplication most likely arose in his germ line. In family two (HSC1417), it was one of the maternal grandmother's X chromosomes that was transmitted to the proband (fig. 6B). Since the grandmother does not carry the duplication in her somatic cells (leukocytes), the duplication most likely arose in her germ line. It is possible, however, that in one or both of these grandparents the duplication arose in an embryonic cell prior to segregation of the germ line. In such a case the resulting mosaicism might be detectable in some non-germ-line tissues, but only the leukocytes were investigated in the present study. There is also the possibility that one or both of these duplications arose in a postzygotic somatic division in the mother of the proband. If this happened, it must have been at a very early embryonic stage, since the duplications are clearly present in both mothers' somatic cells as well as in their germ cells. Also, the unequal crossover event would have had to occur between the sister chromatids of the mother's duplicationbearing X chromosome, since crossing-over between nonsister chromatids of the mother's two X chromosomes would have resulted in the exchange of the flanking RFLPs of the duplication-bearing X chromosome received by her son and her daughter. No such switch of the flanking RFLPs was found. The demonstration of a male origin of duplication  Duplication Mutation at the DMD Locus in the DMD locus would indicate the involvement of an intrachromosomal event such as unequal sisterchromatid exchange. In addition to the case described in the present study (HSC1337), we have elsewhere reported three other DMD duplications with a male origin (Hu et al. 1989) (table 1), suggesting that duplications may arise more frequently by an intrachromosomal mechanism than by an interchromosomal mechanism such as unequal crossing-over in meiosis. It is interesting that the only duplication (HSC1417) that we found to display a female origin also indicates an unequal sister-chromatid exchange event. If this duplication had resulted from nonsister chromatid exchange, the polymorphic alleles flanking the duplicated region would have been recombined. However, no recombination of flanking RFLPs was found. We were able to study the DNA from mothers of seven isolated duplication cases (five DMD [HSC679, 689, 1337, 1417, and 1575] and two intermediate [HSC627 and 1045]), and all seven were found to carry the duplication. In addition, five of the seven mothers had elevated CK levels, and this further confirmed their carrier status. This indicates that none of these seven duplications originated as new mutations in the mother. Roses (1988) has recently reported a study of 15 DMD families in which a deletion has been identified. Fourteen of the 15 mothers were found to carry the deletion. Even though the number of cases is too small for statistical analysis, these findings on duplication and deletion are unexpected in view of the theoretical expectation that one-third of DMD patients are new mutants, an expectation which is supported by the majority of population studies (Bobrow et al. 198 8). Further analysis of the population aspects of DMD, combined with molecular analysis, may clarify such apparent discrepancies. One possibility that could lead to fewer new mutants than predicted by Haldane's (1935) rule is a higher rate of mutation in sperm than in ova. Our finding that four duplications originated in a male (the maternal grandfather) and that only one originated in a female (the maternal grandmother) would be in agreement with this view. It is known that in human germ-cell development, all oocytes can be formed by as few as 23 cell divisions occurring before birth, while several hundred cell divisions are needed for the formation of sperm (Vogel and Rathenberg 1975). If there is no selection and the chance for a chromatid exchange event per cell division is equal in male and female, it would be expected that mutant sperm would accumulate during spermatogenesis, i.e., the frequency of a sperm carrying a mutant gene would  693  be higher than the frequency of an ovum carrying a mutant gene. Since unequal sister-chromatid exchange would be expected to be associated with DNA replication, it is therefore likely that duplications do occur more often in male than in female. However, the above explanation assumes that most (if not all) of the duplications are generated in mitosis. Because all five duplications traced to a grandparent were transmitted to only a single offspring, there is no evidence of germ-line mosacism, and a meiotic exchange event cannot be ruled out. Wagstaffet al. (1985) have reported a very interesting finding which might lead to an explanation for a preferential male origin of duplication at the DMD locus. Using haploid yeast strains as experimental material, they observed that meiotic intrachromosomal exchange events occurred at least 10 times more frequently in the absence of a homologous chromosome than its presence. They further suggested that, in the absence of a homologous chromosome, synaptonemal complexes, which are normally required for homologous chromosome pairing, would mediate sister-chromatid pairing, thus resulting in the very high intrachromosomal recombination frequencies seen during haploid meiosis. Since the DMD locus does not have a homologous counterpart on the Y chromosome, a much higher frequency of meiotic intrachromosomal recombination might be expected at this locus. This explanation does not seem to hold for deletion, however, since a recent study (Darras et al. 1988) of 13 deletion families has revealed male origin of the mutation in five families and female origin in eight, a result not suggesting a higher mutation rate in male. In conclusion, the present study suggests the following: (1) Partial gene duplication accounts for the mutation in about 6% of patients with DMD and BMD. Duplications were found to occur at a much lower rate than did deletions, and this may imply that mechanisms other than unequal chromatid exchange play an important role in the generation of deletions at this locus. (2) Duplications that are expected to shift the translational reading frame tend to lead a more severe clinical phenotype than do duplications that maintained the reading frame. (3) Duplications appear to originate more often in male than in female. This might be due either to the differences in the germ-cell development in male and in female or to the lack of homologous pairing of the DMD region in meiosis. (4) The finding that in all five cases ascertained the duplication originated from a single X chromosome would suggest that unequal sister-chromatid exchange is the most common mechanism for the generation of duplication in DMD and  694  BMD. Whether this type of chromosomal exchange also takes place in other parts of the human genome remains to be seen.  Acknowledgments We thank Dr. M.

Partial gene duplication has also been recognized in a few cases. We have conducted a survey for duplication in 72 unrelated nondeletion patients, analyzed by Southern blot hybridization with clones representing the entire DMD cDNA. With careful quantitative analysis of hybridization band intensity, 10 cases were found to carry a duplication of part of the gene, a frequency of 14% for nondeletion cases (10/72), or 6% for all cases (10/181). The extent of these duplications has been characterized according to the published exon-containing HindIII fragment map, and in six of the 10 duplications a novel restriction fragment that spanned the duplication junction was detected. The resulting translational reading frame of mRNA has been predicted for nine duplications. A shift of the reading frame was predicted in four of the six DMD cases and in one of the two intermediate cases, while the reading frame remained uninterrupted in both BMD cases. RFLP and quantitative Southern blot analyses revealed a grandpaternal origin of duplication in four families and grandmaternal origin in one family. In all five families, the duplication was found to originate from a single X chromosome. Unequal sister-chromatid exchange is proposed to be the mechanism for the formation of these duplications."
"1","Common Low-density Lipoprotein Receptor Mutations in the French Canadian Population Eran Leitersdorf,* Evan J. Tobin,* Jean Davignon,t and Helen H. Hobbs* *Departments ofMolecular Genetics and Internal Medicine, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas 75235; and tThe Clinical Research Institute ofMontreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada  Abstract Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) has a frequency of 0.2% in most populations of the world. In selected populations such as the Afrikaners in South Africa, the Christian Lebanese, and the French Canadians, the disease is more frequent due to the founder effect. Previous studies demonstrated that a single mutation at the LDL receptor locus, the so-called French Canadian deletion, makes up 60% of the mutant genes responsible for FH in the French Canadian population. In this study, efforts were directed to determine if there were other common LDL receptor mutations in this population. Three missense mutations were identified and each mutation was reproduced and expressed in vitro. Two of the three mutations result in the production of an LDL receptor protein that is not processed to its mature form at a normal rate. Molecular assays were developed to detect the mutations directly, and the LDL receptor genes of 130 French Canadian FH heterozygotes were screened for the presence of the three missense mutations as well as two deletions. LDL receptor mutations were detected in 76% of individuals and 14% had one of the three missense mutations. (J. Clin. Invest. 1990. 85:1014-1023.) familial hypercholesterolemia- LDL receptors hypercholesterolemia  Introduction Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)' is an autosomal dominant disorder due to mutations in the LDL receptor gene (1). FH heterozygotes have a two- to threefold elevation in plasma LDL associated with tendon xanthomas and accelerated atherosclerosis. FH homozygotes have a markedly elevated level of plasma LDL and these individuals often develop coronary atherosclerosis in childhood (1). The LDL receptor gene has been cloned (2) and numerous mutant alleles from individuals with FH have been characterized at a molecular level.

Hobbs  array of different mutations in the LDL receptor gene have been described, including nonsense mutations, missense mutations, deletions, and insertions (3). The mutations have been classified into four groups based on the characteristics of the LDL receptor protein produced (4). In normal fibroblasts, an LDL receptor precursor protein is produced in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and has an apparent molecular mass of 120 kD on SDS gel electrophoresis. Within 30 min the protein is transported to the Golgi complex and increases in size by 40 kD due to the addition of N- and 0-linked sugars. From the Golgi complex, the receptor is transported to the cell surface where it binds its ligand, LDL, and is internalized by endocytosis (5). LDL receptor alleles with a so-called class 1 mutation fail to produce any LDL receptor protein as determined by immunoprecipitation with an anti-LDL receptor monoclonal antibody (6). LDL receptor mutations of the class 2 phenotype make a precursor protein that is not transported at a normal rate from the ER to the Golgi complex, and the 120-kD precursor protein accumulates in the ER. Class 3 mutations produce an LDL receptor protein that is transported normally to the cell surface, but fails to bind LDL. And finally, mutations of the class 4 type make an LDL receptor protein that binds LDL normally but fails to be internalized. The frequency of FH differs quite dramatically in different populations of the world. In the European and North American populations, the frequency of heterozygous FH is estimated to be 0.2% (1). However, in selected other populations such as the Afrikaners of South Africa (7), the Christian Lebanese (8), and the French Canadians (9), the frequency of FH has been found to be two- to fivefold higher. In these populations, one or two mutant alleles at the LDL receptor locus predominate, unlike most populations where almost every unrelated individual with FH has a different LDL receptor mutation (Hobbs H. H., et al., unpublished observations). For example, in the Afrikaners the frequency of FH has been estimated to be five times higher than the general European population, and two LDL receptor missense mutations comprise > 95% of the mutant alleles in 12 Afrikaner FH homozygotes (10). In the French Canadian population, the frequency of FH has been estimated to be 0.5%, or about two to three times the rate in the general population (9). A large deletion (> 10 kb) in the 5' region of the LDL receptor gene (which will be referred to as the French Canadian deletion) has been shown to comprise 60% of mutant LDL receptor alleles causing FH in French Canadians from the Montreal area (11). It was previously speculated that the high frequency of this deletion in the French Canadian population was due to the founder effect (1 1). The present-day French Canadian population is descended from - 6,000-7,000 original settlers who emigrated from northeastern and western France to eastern Canada in the 17th and 18th centuries ( 12). The French Canadians remained ge-  netically isolated from the English due to social and geographic factors. They were mostly farmers and settled in more remote areas as their numbers grew. The families were large and the French Canadian population expanded rapidly after 1700. Presumably, among the initial group of immigrants there were individuals or families who had FH due to the French Canadian deletion. When the ancestries of some individuals with the French Canadian deletion were traced (including one from San Francisco and another from Massachusetts), all had ancestors from the same small town northeast of Montreal called Kamouraska. This observation supports the hypothesis that these families share ascendants (13). Since a single mutation in the LDL receptor gene, i.e., the French Canadian deletion, was found to make up 60% of the mutant alleles in this population, the question arose whether there were other common mutant LDL receptor alleles in the remaining 40%. In another study, Ma et al. have identified a 5-kb deletion that includes exons 2 and 3 of the LDL receptor gene, and this mutation was found in 5% of 80 French Canadian FH heterozygotes screened (14). To determine if there were other common LDL receptor mutations in this population, we analyzed the LDL receptor genes of 11 French Canadian FH homozygotes. We used 10 restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) associated with LDL receptor locus to construct haplotypes in order to estimate the number of different mutant alleles in the sample (15). Only three different LDL receptor haplotypes were identified and the coding region of an allele associated with each haplotype was sequenced. Three different missense mutations were found and assays were developed to detect each of these mutations directly. The molecular assays were used to screen the LDL receptor genes from 130 FH heterozygotes from the greater Montreal area.  Methods Materials. The restriction enzymes used for RFLP analysis were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase and the thermal cycler used for DNA amplification were obtained from Perkin Elmer Cetus (Norwalk, CT). The oligonucleotides used for DNA dot blot hybridization analysis were synthesized on a DNA synthesizer model 280A obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA); genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells using the nucleic acid extractor model 340A purchased from the same company. [y-32P]ATP (7,000 Ci/mmol) used for end-labeling oligonucleotides was purchased from ICN Radiochemicals (Irvine, CA) and the [35S]methionine (- 1,000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from New England Nuclear (Boston, MA). The nylon membranes used for oligonucleotide hybridization were purchased from ICN Radiochemicals. IgG-C7 and IgG-200 1, mouse MAbs directed against amino acid residues 2-42 of the human LDL receptor and an irrelevant antibody, respectively, were prepared as previously described (6, 16). The bacteriophage M 13 replicative form DNAs were obtained from Pharmacia LKB (Piscataway, NJ). Haplotype analysis of French Canadian FH homozygotes. Genomic DNA was isolated from fibroblasts that were cultured from skin biopsy specimens of 11 French Canadian FH homozygotes. 8 Atg of genomic DNA was digested with a fivefold excess of 10 different restriction enzymes shown previously to reveal RFLPs (15). Subsequent to digestion, the DNA was fractionated on a 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. The filters were hybridized with the appropriate probes, and the LDL receptor haplotypes were determined and numbered as previously reported (15).  DNA sequencing of mutant alleles. Each exon of the LDL receptor gene was individually amplified from 1 jtg of genomic DNA from either FH 883, FH 47, or FH 787 using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Taq polymerase as described (15, 17). In each reaction, specific oligonucleotides, one end-labeled with [y-32P]ATP (18) and one unlabeled, homologous to the intron sequences flanking the exon, were used (Table II). The amplification products were size-fractionated on a 6% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel in TBE (50 mM Tris at pH 8, 90 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA at pH 8.3). The band corresponding to the amplified exon sequence was excised from the gel, and the DNA was purified before sequencing by the Maxam and Gilbert tech-  nique (19).  Oligonucleotide hybridization ofgenomic DNA. Exons 3, 4, and 14 of the LDL receptor gene were individually amplified by PCR using 1 ,ug of genomic DNA and 25-base oligonucleotides homologous to sequences flanking each mutation. After 35 rounds of PCR-directed amplification, one-tenth of the amplified DNA product was denatured in 400 mM NaOH/25 mM sodium EDTA and dotted onto duplicate nylon membranes as previously described (20). Oligonucleotides homologous to the normal and mutant sequences were end-labeled with [y-32P]ATP (18) and purified using cetylpyridinium bromide (21). A total of 1 X 106 cpm/ml of each oligonucleotide was hybridized individually to duplicate filters in 5X SSPE (IX SSPE contains 0.9 M NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate, and 5 mM EDTA at pH 7.4), 0.05% (vol/vol) each of BSA, Ficoll 400, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone 360 and 0.5% (vol/vol) SDS for 16 h at 420C. The filters were then washed sequentially at different temperatures using the following buffers: buffer A (2X SSPE, 0.5% [vol/vol] SDS); buffer B (IX SSPE, 0.25% [vol/vol] SDS); buffer C (0.2X SSPE, 0.1% [vol/vol] SDS), and buffer D (0.1 X SSPE, 0.1% [vol/vol] SDS). The filters were washed in buffers A, B, and C at room temperature before washing in buffers C and D at 370C. Then they were washed in buffer D for 10 min at 420C and 45-520C. The final washing temperatures for each oligonucleotide were as follows: 470C for both the mutant and normal oligo 47, 520C for both mutant and normal oligo 883, 450C for the mutant oligo 787, and 520C for the corresponding normal oligonucleotide. The filters were exposed to XAR-5 (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) film for 1- 12 h at -70'C using an intensifying screen (Lightning Plus; DuPont Instruments, Wilmington, DE). Mutagenesis and transfection of mammalian cells. DNA fragments from the expression plasmid pLDLR-2 were subeloned into the bacteriophage M 13 and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed as previously described (22, 23). A double-stranded fragment that contained the mutation was subeloned into a plasmid containing the normal human LDL receptor cDNA under the control of the simian virus (SV) 40 early promoter (pLDLR-2). Three plasmids called p883, p47, and p787 were constructed. Each plasmid had the same missense mutation as had been found in the LDL receptor gene of the corresponding FH homozygote fibroblast cell line. DNA from the three plasmids was prepared, and after the mutation was confirmed by sequencing, the DNA was transfected into COS-M6 cells as previously described (23). 2 d after transfection, the cells were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine for 15 min, and then an excess of cold methionine was added to the media. After various time intervals, cell extracts were made and the LDL receptors were immunoprecipitated using the anti-LDL receptor MAbs, IgG-C7 (6). The immunoprecipitated proteins were fractionated on an SDS polyacrylamide gel. The apparent molecular masses were calculated by reference to the following markers: myosin (200 kD), B-galactosidase (116 kD), phosphorylase 6 (97 kD), BSA (68 kD), and ovalbumin (43 kD). The gel was exposed to XAR-5 film for the times indicated in the legend of Fig. 2.  Results Genomic DNA was extracted from blood leukocytes of 130 unrelated FH heterozygotes who reside within 50 miles of Familial Hypercholesterolemia in French Canadians  1015  Montreal, Canada. Every FH heterozygote had an elevated LDL level, tendon xanthomas, and a family history of hypercholesterolemia. Their pedigrees were constructed and none were found to be related at the second degree level. Genomic blotting was performed to assay for the presence of the French Canadian deletion and the 5-kb deletion (data not shown) (1 1, 14). Of the 130 FH heterozygotes tested, 77 (59%) were found to have the French Canadian deletion and four (3%) had the '5-kb deletion. To determine and identify the LDL receptor mutations responsible for FH in the other 38% of these French Canadian heterozygotes, LDL receptor haplotype analysis was performed using genomic DNA extracted from fibroblasts of 11 French Canadian FH homozygotes that had been cultured from skin biopsy specimens by Dr. M. S. Brown and Dr. J. L. Goldstein. The 11 French Canadian FH homozygotes are listed in Table I. The city of origin of the physicians who sent the skin biopsy specimens are given, as well as any history of consanguinity. LDL receptor protein biosynthetic studies had been previously performed using these cultured fibroblasts in  the laboratory of Dr. M. S. Brown and Dr. J. L. Goldstein. The cells were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine for 2 h and then washed for 2 h with cold methionine before immunoprecipitation using an anti-receptor MAb, IgG-C7. A quantification of the amount of LDL receptor protein in the precursor (120 kD) and mature form (160 kD) was determined by densitometry, and the results are summarized in Table I. In normal fibroblasts, 100% of the receptor protein is in the 160-kD mature form after a 2-h pulse and 2-h chase. The fibroblasts from FH homozygotes 49, 549, 808, 859, and 896 produced no immunoprecipitable protein and thus were of the class 1 phenotype. FH homozygotes 47, 787, and 896 produced an LDL receptor precursor protein of normal size that failed to be completely converted to the mature 160-kD form after a 2-h chase. FH 883, 807, and 764 produced a protein of normal size that was defective in cell surface binding to either LDL or IgG-C7 (data not shown). Also included in Table I are the results of RNA blot analysis and LDL receptor haplotype analysis which were performed as previously described (15, 24). Of the 11 FH homozygotes, 8 were found to be homozygous for  Table I. Analysis of LDL Receptor Gene and Protein in 1I French Canadian FH Homozygotes A.

Leitersdorf, E. J. Tobin, J. Davignon, and H. H. Hobbs  the same haplotype, and subsequently were determined to be homozygous for the same mutation (Nos. 1-8, Table I). Three of the FE homozygotes were heterozygous for at least one restriction site and thus were probably compound heterozygotes (Nos. 9-1 1, Table I). One FH homozygote, FH 764, was half French Canadian; his mother was German and his father was French Canadian, and therefore only his paternal allele was included in the analysis. Only three different LDL receptor haplotypes were found among the 21 mutant LDL receptor alleles represented in this sample: haplotype 3', haplotype 2, and haplotype 31 (Table I, part B). The fact that only three haplotypes were identified suggested that there may be only three LDL receptor mutations in the sample of 21 mutant LDL receptor alleles screened. The DNA samples were assayed for the presence of the French Canadian deletion by genomic blotting, and it was determined that all the LDL receptor alleles of haplotype 3' (57%) had the French Canadian deletion. None of the FH homozygotes had the 5-kb deletion described by Ma et al. ( 14). The rest of the mutant LDL alleles had either haplotype 2 (24%) or haplotype 31 (19%). FH 47 and FH 883 were each homozygous for one of the two common haplotypes (haplotypes 2 and 31, respectively), and the coding regions of their LDL receptor genes were sequenced. Oligonucleotides homologous to intron sequences flanking each of exons 1-17 and the 5' region of exon 18 of the LDL receptor gene (Table II) were used to amplify the coding region of the gene by PCR from genomic DNA of FH 47 and FH 883. For each exon, the amplified DNA fragment containing the exon sequence was purified and subsequently sequenced by the technique of Maxam and Gilbert (19). One basepair substitution was identified in each FH homozygote when the sequence was compared with the LDL receptor cDNA sequence (25) (Fig. 1). In Fig. 1 A, the sequence of the coding strand of exon 3 from a normal individual is compared with FH 883. A single basepair change (a thymidine to guanine substitution) was identified in codon 66, and this substitution would predict an amino acid change of tryptophan to glycine. Fig. 1 B shows partial sequence of exon 14 from both a normal individual and FH 47 (who was homozygous for LDL receptor haplotype 2). A basepair change (guanine to adenine) results in an amino acid substitution of tyrosine for cysteine at position 646. FH 787, a French Canadian FH homozygote who was also homozygous for LDL receptor haplotype 2, did not have this mutation as was initially anticipated. Therefore, the coding region of FH 787 was sequenced and a single basepair substitution was identified in the 3' end of exon 4 when the noncoding strand was sequenced. In the third position of codon 207, a cytosine to thymidine transition was identified resulting in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution (Fig. 1 C). To confirm that these three amino acid substitutions were not polymorphisms, each mutation was reproduced in a expression plasmid containing the normal LDL receptor cDNA under the control of the simian virus (SV) 40 promoter and expressed transiently in transfected COS-M6 cells. 48 h after transfection, biosynthetic studies of the LDL receptor protein were performed (Fig. 2). The cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine for 15 min before chasing with cold methionine for 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min. The cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using IgG-C7 and the products were size-fractionated on a polyacrylamide-SDS gel before performing autoradiography. The results of three separate experi-  ments are shown (Fig. 2). In each experiment the LDL receptor protein produced by cells transfected with the mutant cDNA was compared with cells transfected with the normal LDL receptor cDNA. Since similar results were obtained in the three experiments using the plasmid expressing the normal LDL receptor cDNA, only one example is given (Fig. 2 A). Using normal fibroblasts, after a 15-min pulse and no chase only the 1 20-kD precursor protein was seen. By 60 min almost half of the LDL receptor protein was in the mature 160-kD form. It was previously shown by Esser et al. that when the LDL receptor is expressed in COS cells, the processing of the protein from the 120- to the 160-kD mature form is slower than in fibroblasts (23, 26). Similar results were observed in the current studies. After a 15-min pulse, at least 1 h of chase was required before 50% of the receptor was in its mature 160-kD form. Fig. 2 B shows the results of COS cells transfected with p47 (Cys6' -- Tyr). Even after a 120-min chase the LDL receptor precursor protein failed to be converted to the mature form, which is identical to what was observed in the biosynthetic studies performed using fibroblasts from FH 47 (Table I). Fig. 2 C shows the results of the same study using cells transfected with a plasmid containing the LDL receptor cDNA with the mutation identical to that found in FH 787 (G8U207-* Lys). These cells produced a protein that was processed more slowly than normal, but unlike FH 47, some of the receptor protein did get processed to the mature 160-kD form. This is  consistent with biosynthetic studies of fibroblasts from the FH homozygote 787 (Table I). Finally, Fig. 2 D shows the results of using a plasmid with the (Trp66 Gly) mutation found in FH 883. The mutation did not result in any difference in LDL receptor processing, which is consistent with the biosynthetic studies previously performed in fibroblasts from this individual. The 49 French Canadian FH heterozygotes who did not have the French Canadian deletion or the 5-kb deletion described by Ma et al. ( 14) were analyzed for the presence of one of the-three missense mutations identified in the French Canadian FH homozygotes. The exons containing the three mutations were individually amplified by PCR, and the amplified DNA was fixed to duplicate nylon filters. The filters were selectively hybridized with an allele-specific, kinased, 20-base oligonucleotide encoding either the normal or the mutant sequence (Fig. 3). Amplified genomic DNA from a normal individual, the three FH homozygotes known to be homozygous for each of the three missense mutations described, two compound heterozygotes (FH 893 and FH 807), and six French Canadian FR heterozygotes were compared. Fig. 3 A shows the results of the dot blot analysis after hybridization with a normal and mutant oligonucleotide that were homologous to the sequences flanking and including the mutation found in FH 883. The normal probe hybridized to the amplified exon 3specific DNA from a normal individual but not with the DNA from FH 883. The mutant probe (oligo 883) hybridized only with the DNA from FH 883 and not the normal individual. The normal probe hybridized with FR 47 and FH 787, which confirmed that their LDL receptor mutations were located elsewhere in the gene. FH 807 and 893 had previously been shown to be compound heterozygotes; in each, one allele had the French Canadian deletion while the other did not. Both the normal and mutant probe (oligo 883) hybridized with the amplified DNA from FH 807, whereas only the normal oligonucleotide hybridized with 893. Also shown is a subset of the 49 Familial Hypercholesterolemia in French Canadians  1017  French Canadian FH heterozygotes that were analyzed, and four out of the six were found to be heterozygous for this mutation. Fig. 3 B shows a similar analysis of exon 14-specific DNA amplified from the same FH homozygotes and six different FH heterozygotes. The duplicate filters were hybridized with end-labeled oligonucleotides homologous to the normal or the mutant sequence. Again, only the normal oligonucleotide hybridized to the normal DNA and the DNA from the other two true homozygotes, FH 883 and 787, but it did not hybridize to  the amplified DNA from FH 47. Oligo 47 hybridized with the DNA from FH 47 and both the normal and mutant oligo hybridized with FH 893. Therefore, FH 893 is heterozygous for this mutation. Finally, Fig. 3 C shows the same analysis using amplified DNA samples from exon 4 after hybridizing with an oligonucleotide homologous to the normal exon 4 sequence and that found in FH 787. A compilation of the results of the dot blot hybridization analysis for the FH heterozygotes and homozygotes is shown in Table III.

These three mutations, together with the two previously identified deletions (1 1, 14), make up 76% of the mutant LDL receptor alleles causing FH in the French Canadian population, at least in the Montreal region. The frequency of FH in French Canadians in Quebec province has been recently estimated to be 1 in 270 (9). This frequency is approximately two times higher than seen in most other populations of the world (1). The frequency was found to be even higher (1 in 154) in the northeastern part of Quebec province (9). The cause of the high frequency of FH in this population is thought to be the founder effect (1 1), which is supported by this study. Only five mutations at the LDL receptor locus comprise three-quarters of the mutant LDL receptor alleles causing FH in this population. To identify the mutations that predominate in the French Canadian population, LDL receptor haplotype analysis was used to analyze the LDL receptor genes in 11 French Canadian FH homozygotes. Previously, it was shown at other loci that different mutations are often in linkage disequilibrium with particular allele haplotypes (27). 10 RFLPs associated with the LDL receptor gene were used to determine the LDL receptor haplotypes in the FH homozygotes (15). Only three LDL receptor haplotypes were identified in the 21 mutant LDL receptor alleles surveyed. Three of the FH homozygotes who did not have the French Canadian deletion were homozygous at every site. Homozygosity for all 10 restriction sites suggested homozygosity for a mutation since the heterozygosity index using the 10 RFLPs was previously shown to be 85% (15). The coding regions of the LDL receptor gene from these three fibroblast cell lines were sequenced in their entirety and different basepair substitutions were identified that result in single amino acid changes. The basepair substitutions were conclusively shown to be responsible for the altered LDL receptor protein phenotype in FH 47 and 787 by reproducing and expressing the mutations in vitro. Both of the mutations found in FH 47 and FH 787 result in the production of an LDL receptor protein of the class 2 phenotype. To date, seven other LDL receptor mutations, including three small in-frame deletions (28, 29), one nonsense mutation (30), and three missense mutations (20, 31, 32) have been reported to result in a similar phenotype. When immunocytochemical studies were performed on cultured fibroblasts from an FH homozygote with this phenotype, the LDL receptor was found to be concentrated in the transitional elements of the ER (33). Numerous studies have demonstrated  that the transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi complex is a highly regulated process and denatured or malfolded proteins are not transported normally out of the ER to the Golgi complex (34, 35). So presumably the mutations at the LDL receptor locus that result in a class 2 phenotype somehow interfere with the proper folding of the LDL receptor protein. The mechanism by which the malfolded protein is recognized and retained in the ER is not clear. The LDL receptor mutations of the class 2 type cluster in two functional domains of the LDL receptor gene; the ligandbinding domain and the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain. The ligand-binding domain is encoded by exons 2-6 and consists of seven cysteine-rich repeats that are - 40 amino acids in length. It is to this region of the protein that the ligands for the LDL receptor, including LDL and #l-VLDL, bind. There is a highly conserved triplet of negatively charged amino acids (ser-asp-glu) that is found near the COOH terminus of each ligand binding repeat. In the fifth ligand-binding repeat of FH 787 there is a substitution of a lysine for the glutamic acid residue at the terminal position of this conserved triplet. This substitution results in a change of a basic for an acidic amino acid residue which somehow interferes with the folding of the LDL receptor protein so that it is not transported out of the ER at a normal rate. The mutation in FH 47 is located in the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain. This region of the LDL receptor protein is encoded by exons 7-14 and is 400 amino acids in length. It contains three repeats (A, B, and C) which are 40 amino acids in length, and each repeat contains six cysteine residues. The mutation in FH 47 is in exon 14 which encodes the C repeat, and the missense mutation results in the substitution of a tyrosine for one of the six cysteine residues. The effect of this mutation is to completely block the transport of the protein out of the ER. It is tempting to attribute the defect in processing to the loss of a cysteine residue. If all of the six cysteines normally form disulfide bonds within the repeat, this would leave a single unpaired cysteine residue. This unpaired cysteine may then form a disulfide bond with another protein. However, Esser and Russell (31) have shown that the presence of an unpaired cysteine residue in the C repeat of the LDL receptor protein is not necessary or sufficient to produce a defect in the transport of the protein out of the ER. Rather, it seems that exon 14 is very sensitive to changes in its sequence and its requirements for proper folding and resulting transport are quite stringent (31).  Familial Hypercholesterolemia in French Canadians  1021  The amino acid substitution in FH 883 is located in the second ligand binding repeat and does not interfere with the processing of the LDL receptor protein. However, it does interfere with either the binding of the receptor to its ligand or the turnover of the LDL receptor protein. Unfortunately, the amount of expression ofthis plasmid in COS cells was too low to perform either binding or protein turnover studies. The mutations found in FH 47 and 883 have not yet been seen in any individuals outside of Quebec. However, the basepair substitution identified in FH 787 has been found in another FH homozygote, FH 525. The RFLP haplotype linked to a mutation can be used to estimate the number of times the mutation has occurred, as has been done at the (l-globin locus for sickle cell anemia and a subset of mutations causing #-thalassemia (36-38). If the same mutation is found in unrelated individuals on an allele of an identical RFLP haplotype, it is likely that they share an ascendent. If, however, the mutation is found on a very different haplotype, then it is probable that the mutation has occurred more than once, assuming that it was not an ancient event. FH 525 is from Mexico and though he is homozygous for the same mutation as FH 787 the mutation is found on an LDL receptor allele of a completely different haplotype. FH 525 is homozygous for haplotype 31 and FH 787 is homozygous for haplotype 2; these two haplotypes differ at four sites (see Table I, part B). The fact that the same mutation is present on LDL receptor alleles of different haplotypes suggests that the mutation occurred more than once. The mutation consists of a base-substitution of a thymidine for a cytosine at a CpG dimer, and CpG dimers have been shown to be hot spots for mutational events in the human genome  (39, 40).  The high frequency of FH in the French Canadian population is presumed to be due to the founder effect. This is supported by the fact that when families with the French Canadian deletion were traced back to the original immigrants, they were all found to originate from the same region (13). The mutations described in this paper are less frequent then the French Canadian deletion, and this may represent later entry of the mutations into the population. The frequency of the mutations may vary significantly in other regions of Quebec province due to differences in the migration patterns of the early settlers. A demographic study of each mutation would facilitate the analysis of LDL receptor gene mutations in the French Canadians. By performing Southern blot analysis to detect the two deletions, and dot blot oligonucleotide hybridization studies to detect the three missense mutations, 76% of the mutant alleles responsible for FH in the Montreal region can be detected directly. The percentages for each of the mutations may be quite different in other regions of Eastern Canada. The ability to detect mutations at the LDL receptor locus directly in a majority of individuals with FH will facilitate the prenatal diagnosis of homozygous FH in the French Canadian population. The assays can also be used to confirm the diagnosis of FH in a patient where the clinical diagnosis is not clear. Whether or not any of these mutations are a common cause of FH in France has not been investigated.

Familial Hypercholesterolemia in French Canadians  1023  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) has a frequency of 0.2% in most populations of the world. In selected populations such as the Afrikaners in South Africa, the Christian Lebanese, and the French Canadians, the disease is more frequent due to the founder effect. Previous studies demonstrated that a single mutation at the LDL receptor locus, the so-called French Canadian deletion, makes up 60% of the mutant genes responsible for FH in the French Canadian population. In this study, efforts were directed to determine if there were other common LDL receptor mutations in this population. Three missense mutations were identified and each mutation was reproduced and expressed in vitro. Two of the three mutations result in the production of an LDL receptor protein that is not processed to its mature form at a normal rate. Molecular assays were developed to detect the mutations directly, and the LDL receptor genes of 130 French Canadian FH heterozygotes were screened for the presence of the three missense mutations as well as two deletions. LDL receptor mutations were detected in 76% of individuals and 14% had one of the three missense mutations.Common low-density lipoprotein receptor mutations in the French Canadian population."

Lindsley, January 19, 1990  ABSTRACT Saposins are small, heat-stable glycoproteins required for the hydrolysis of sphingolipids by specific lysosomal hydrolases. Saposins A, B, C, and D are derived by proteolytic processing from a single precursor protein named prosaposin. Saposin B, previously known as SAP-1 and sulfatide activator, stimulates the hydrolysis of a wide variety of substrates including cerebroside sulfate, GM1 ganglioside, and globotriaosylceramide by arylsulfatase A, acid 8-galactosidase, and a-galactosidase, respectively. Human saposin B deficiency, transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, results in tissue accumulation of cerebroside sulfate and a clinical picture resembling metachromatic leukodystrophy (activatordeficient metachromatic leukodystrophy). We have examined transformed lymphoblasts from the initially reported saposin B-deficient patient and found normal amounts of saposins A, C, and D. After preparing first-strand cDNA from lymphoblast total RNA, we used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the prosaposin cDNA. The patient's mRNA differed from the normal sequence by only one C -- T transition in the 23rd codon of saposin B, resulting in a threonine to isoleucine amino acid substitution. An affected male sibling has the same mutation as the proband and their heterozygous mother carries both the normal and mutant sequences, providing additional evidence that this base change is the disease-causing mutation. This base change results in the replacement of a polar amino acid (threonine) with a nonpolar amino acid (isoleucine) and, more importantly, eliminates the glycosylation signal in this activator protein. One explanation for the deficiency of saposin B in this disease is that the mutation may increase the degradation of saposin B by exposing a potential proteolytic cleavage site (arginine) two amino acids to the amino-terminal side of the glycosylation site when the carbohydrate side chain is absent. The lysosomal hydrolysis of sphingolipids is catalyzed by the sequential action of acid hydrolases. Several small heatstable glycoproteins called sphingolipid activator proteins have been discovered that act as natural nonspecific detergents, or stimulate a specific hydrolase, or both. The complete nucleotide sequence of a cDNA encoding prosaposin, the precursor of saposins A, B, C, and D, has been elucidated (1, 2). Prosaposin is a 524-amino acid glycoprotein and examination of its amino acid sequence reveals four saposin domains. Each domain is -80 amino acid residues long; has nearly identical placement of cysteine residues, glycosylation sites, and helical regions; and is flanked by potential proteolytic cleavage sites (lysine or arginine). Proteolytic cleavage of prosaposin at or near these dibasic amino acids was predicted to give rise to four saposin proteins (1). Each of  these four saposin proteins has now been isolated and their activating properties have been determined (3-14). Saposins A and C specifically activate hydrolysis of glucocerebroside byB-glucosylceramidase (D-glucosyl-N-acylsphingosine glucohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.45) and of galactocerebroside by galactosylceramidase (D-galactosyl-N-acylsphingosine galactohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.46) (3, 4). Saposin D specifically activates the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase (sphingomyelin cholinephosphohydrolase; EC 3.1.4.12) (5). Saposins A, C, and D appear to exert their activities by binding to the respective enzymes, raising the maximal velocity of hydrolysis and lowering the Michaelis constant (5, 6) (S.M. and Y.K., unpublished data). Saposin B, previously designated by several different terms (7, 10, 14, 15), stimulates the hydrolysis of galactocerebroside sulfate by arylsulfatase A (aryl-sulfate sulfohydrolase; EC 3.1.6.1) (7-9), GM1 ganglioside by acid 13galactosidase (J3-D-galactoside galactohydrolase; EC 3.2. 1.23) (10, 11), and globotriaosylceramide by a-galactosidase A (a-D-galactoside galactohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.22) (12, 13). This activator protein may have even broader substrate specificity since it also is an activator of glycerolipid hydrolysis (14). Saposin B activates by a mechanism different from saposins A, C, and D; it interacts with lipid substrates solubilizing them for enzymatic hydrolysis. The physiological significance of saposin B is underscored by the discovery of its absence in a variant form of metachromatic leukodystrophy (activator-deficient metachromatic leukodystrophy) (16-18). In this report, we present evidence for a single base change as the molecular defect in activator-deficient metachromatic leukodystrophy found in two siblings of consanguineous parents and propose that this mutation gives rise to a glycosylation site defect. These results were previously presented independently in preliminary form by our group and by Wenger et al. (19, 20). MATERIALS AND METHODS Quantitation of Saposins. A HPLC method was developed to quantitate the levels of saposins. Transformed lymphoblasts from proband YF with saposin B deficiency and a normal control were grown in suspension culture and collected by precipitation. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline the cell pellets were lyophilized, resuspended, homogenized, boiled, and centrifuged. Supernatant proteins were fractionated by HPLC sequentially on two columns, a hydrophobic Vydac C4 column (The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) using an acetonitrile gradient followed by an Abbreviation: PCR, polymerase chain reaction. tPresent address: Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka 812, Japan. §To whom reprint requests should be addressed.

On the first column, saposins A, C, and D were collected as clustered peaks and on the second column, they were separated as individual peaks, which were quantified. Details of this method will be given in a separate report (S.M. and Y.K., unpublished data). Saposin B had previously been shown to be nearly absent in cultured cells from patient YF by a quantitative immunologic method (17). We also could not detect saposin B in lymphoblasts from patient YF after SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting with monospecific antisaposin B antibodies. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Amplification of Prosaposin cDNA. Total RNA was isolated from transformed lymphoblasts of the index patient by using the RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA was then prepared by using the Red Module (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) as primer according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed as described by Saiki et al. (21). Frozen cell culture stocks of skin fibroblasts from EF, the affected brother of YF, and her mother were used as the source of the RNA for analysis of these samples. Sequencing. Initially, prosaposin cDNA was cloned into pBS-Il (Stratagene) and multiple clones were sequenced using the Sequenase kit (United States Biochemical) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed according to Kretz et al. (22). The PCR products were separated from the primers on a 1% NuSieve (FMC) low-melt agarose gel. The bands were excised and melted at 68°C. The sequencing primer was annealed to the PCR product by heating at 95°C for 10 min and quickly cooling to 37°C. Sequencing was then carried out with the Sequenase kit according to the manufacturer's instructions except that the labeling reaction was carried out at 37oC.¶ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION It was reported earlier that the proband YF had a severe deficiency of saposin B in fibroblasts (<5% of normal) (16, 17). Since saposin B is generated by proteolytic processing of a precursor that also gives rise to three other activator proteins (1), it was important to determine the levels of the other three activator proteins in this patient. HPLC analysis of normal and saposin B-deficient lymphoblasts showed no deficiency of saposin A, C, or D in the proband YF (Table 1), suggesting that the defect was localized to the region encoding saposin B. PCR amplification was performed to generate enough copies of the prosaposin cDNA for nucleotide sequencing. Primers were constructed so that the sequence of the entire  IThe  sequence  reported in this  GenBank data base (accession  paper has been no.  M32221).  deposited in the  prosaposin open reading frame and some 3' flanking sequence totaling 2170 base pairs could be analyzed (Fig. 1). Initially, the product from patient YF was cloned into the phagemid pBS II and several clones were sequenced. A single C -- T transition was found in the 23rd codon of saposin B (Fig. 2), a single base change resulting in the replacement of a threonine residue by an isoleucine residue (Fig. 3). No other base changes were found after sequencing the entire prosaposin open reading frame. These results are in accord with those recently reported by Wenger et al. (20). To provide additional evidence that this base substitution is the disease-causing mutation, we amplified prosaposin cDNA from fibroblast RNA from the affected brother of the proband (EF), her mother, and several controls, sequencing the PCR products directly. As expected, EF has the same base change as YF, and her mother has two bands of approximately equal intensity at this position, representing the normal and mutant alleles (Fig. 2). Samples from three normal subjects each gave the normal sequence at this position. We propose that the single base change is a point mutation that generates proteolytically sensitive saposin B. After removal of its signal peptide, prosaposin is glycosylated at five glycosylation sites [two in saposin A, one each in saposins B, C, and D (1, 3,5, 23)]. Prosaposin is proteolyzed to generate saposins A, B, C, and D, with cleavage occurring at or near basic dipeptides at their polypeptide boundaries (1, 2, 24). We propose that the point mutation in the F family abolishes the glycosylation site in saposin B (Asn-Xaa-Thr; Fig. 3) and exposes an arginine residue two residues amino terminal from this site due to the absence of the carbohydrate side chain that normally protects this site from cleavage. Previously, we analyzed the structure of saposin B by helical wheel depictions of its helical structure and analysis of hydropathy plots. We concluded that the region in question is hydrophilic and exposed at a turn of the polypeptide chain. Since normal processing of prosaposin occurs by proteolysis at dibasic amino acid residues, proteolytic enzymes are present that could accomplish cleavage of the mutant protein at the exposed arginine. This proposal is consonant with pulse-chase experiments in fibroblasts from YF in which prosaposin is normally synthesized and excreted in the presence of ammonium chloride but mature saposin B is not detected (25).

Note the C -I T transition in the two patient samples and the double band in the mother.  method with direct sequencing to detect the defect will be useful in diagnosing additional patients with this disease. Examination of the primary structures of saposins A, C, and D revealed that each of the glycosylation sites (two sites in saposin A, and one site each in saposins C and D) has either arginine or lysine, or both, residues within three amino acids of the glycosylation signal. Similarly, inspection of the amino acid sequence of the rat sulfated glycoprotein (SGP-1) (26), known to be 76% homologous to the protein sequence of the human SAP precursor, showed that three of its four glycosylation sites have closely associated arginine or lysine residues. These observations are consistent with the highly conserved structures of these proteins and, moreover, suggest that mutational events destroying other glycosylation sites might also result in the absence of gene product due to the unmasking of proteolytic sites. Glycosylation of proteins has been proposed as a means to retard proteolysis by altering conformation and by protecting sensitive sites (27, 28). Several proteins (including fibroblast fibronectin, acetylcholine receptor of embryonic muscle, and myoblast fusion protein) were found to be degraded more rapidly when cell cultures were treated with tunicamycin, a specific inhibitor of protein glycosylation. The increased cellular degradation of the nonglycosylated proteins was partially arrested by proteinase inhibitors in vivo and it was found that nonglycosylated proteins were degraded more rapidly by specific proteases in vitro. This led to the proposal (27, 29, 30) that specific cleavage sites are unmasked by the absence of carbohydrate side chains. To our knowledge the mutation reported here, in which abolition of a glycosylation site could lead to accelerated proteolysis and human disease, has not been reported elsewhere.

Boldface type indicates the differences between the normal and the patient sequences. The asterisk denotes the position of the potential glycosylation site in the normal sequence. The arrow denotes the potential site of proteolytic cleavage exposed when the asparagine at residue 21 is not glycosylated.  To further inquire whether mutations of the type reported here might be more generalized, we undertook a brief survey of other human proteins by using the Protein Identification Resource (National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, version 22) computer data base. The search looked, first, for the presence of glycosylation signals (Asp-Xaa-Ser or Thr) and, second, for arginine or lysine residues within five amino acids on either side of the signal. The results of the search are as follows: (i) fibronectin contains 11 potential glycosylation sites, 3 with proximal proteolytic cleavage sites; (ii) the acetylcholine receptor a-chain precursor contains a single glycosylation site with a lysine two residues away; (iii) 6 lysosomal proteins, excluding prosaposin, contain a total of 24 potential glycosylation sites, 10 with nearby lysine or arginine residues; (iv) 13 unselected glycoproteins exhibited 47 glycosylation sites, 24 with associated lysine and/or arginine residues. Thus, 46% of the 83 glycosylation signals found in this survey have closely associated potential proteolytic sites. These results hint that the molecular defect reported here may be a member of a possible large class of mutations.

Saposins A, B, C, and D are derived by proteolytic processing from a single precursor protein named prosaposin. Saposin B, previously known as SAP-1 and sulfatide activator, stimulates the hydrolysis of a wide variety of substrates including cerebroside sulfate, GM1 ganglioside, and globotriaosylceramide by arylsulfatase A, acid beta-galactosidase, and alpha-galactosidase, respectively. Human saposin B deficiency, transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, results in tissue accumulation of cerebroside sulfate and a clinical picture resembling metachromatic leukodystrophy (activator-deficient metachromatic leukodystrophy). We have examined transformed lymphoblasts from the initially reported saposin B-deficient patient and found normal amounts of saposins A, C, and D. After preparing first-strand cDNA from lymphoblast total RNA, we used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the prosaposin cDNA. The patient's mRNA differed from the normal sequence by only one C----T transition in the 23rd codon of saposin B, resulting in a threonine to isoleucine amino acid substitution. An affected male sibling has the same mutation as the proband and their heterozygous mother carries both the normal and mutant sequences, providing additional evidence that this base change is the disease-causing mutation. This base change results in the replacement of a polar amino acid (threonine) with a nonpolar amino acid (isoleucine) and, more importantly, eliminates the glycosylation signal in this activator protein. One explanation for the deficiency of saposin B in this disease is that the mutation may increase the degradation of saposin B by exposing a potential proteolytic cleavage site (arginine) two amino acids to the amino-terminal side of the glycosylation site when the carbohydrate side chain is absent.Characterization of a mutation in a family with saposin B deficiency: a glycosylation site defect."

Introduction Although cystic fibrosis (CF) has affected humans for generations, this disease was not clinically recognized as a distinct entity until the 1930s. Dorothy Andersen (1938) correctly proposed that the intestinal disorders and vitamin A deficiencies seen in these patients were due to the degeneration of the pancreas. Pedigree analysis has established CF as an autosomal recessive disorder (Andersen and Hodges, 1947), and di Sant’Agnese et al. (1953) observed that CF patients secrete an excess of sodium and chloride ions in their sweat. This observation led to the development of the sweat iontophoresis test, which remains the differential diagnostic indicator of CF (Gibson and Cooke, 1959).  Several reports have documented a defect in the regulation of chloride ion transport of CF epithelial cells from tissue, primary culture, and immortalized cells (Knowles et al., 1981; Quinton and Bijman, 1983; Sato and Sato, 1984; Welsh and Liedkte, 1986). The chloride channel in normal cells is activated by f3-adrenergic agents through the production of intracellular CAMP (Quinton, 1983; Knowles et al., 1983; Sato and Sato, 1984). Although CF cells can be shown to produce CAMP in response to such agents, the channels are not activated. However, chloride transport can be measured in CF cells in response to membrane depolarization or through stimulation of protein kinase C in the presence of calcium (Frizzell et al., 1986; Li et al., 1989; Hwang et al., 1989). Therefore, the CF defect may disrupt a pathway whereby CAMP regulates ion transport, but no defective protein has been identified in CF cells to date. The clinical presentation of CF is variable both between and within families (Rosenstein and Langbaum, 1984). The majority of patients are diagnosed by the time of adolescence, but a few individuals remain undiagnosed until the ages of 30-65 (di Sant’Agnese and Davis, 1979; Su and Beanblossom, 1989). Severe, classical CF is characterized by abnormalities of the intestine (obstructions, i.e., meconium ileus), lungs (infections), pancreas (failure to secrete digestive enzymes), and the reproductive organs (azo-ospermia, low female fertility) (Rosenstein and Langbaum, 1984). If untreated, the average age of survival is 3-5 years. In contrast, the average lifespan of patients receiving optimum treatment (antibiotics, digestive enzymes, and respiratory therapy) is 25-30 (Boat et al., 1989). Virtually all patients develop pulmonary damage due to colonization of the lung with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A milder form of the disease has been documented in 100/o-15% of patients, in which pancreatic function is less abnormal and the requirement for pancreatic enzymes is absent or reduced. These patients are described as pancreatic sufficient (PS) (Gaskin et al., 1982). Durie et al. (1986) have demonstrated that PS patients have higher levels of serum trypsinogen. Direct measurement has shown increased levels of exocrine enzymes in PS patients (Kopelman et al., 1985). PS is typically concordant within families, and these patients have different haplotypes for closely linked markers when compared with more severely affected patients (Gasparini et al., 1990; Kerem et al., 1989a; this report). This genetic information suggests that PS patients have less severe mutations in the CF gene. CF is the most common fatal genetic disease in Caucasians, with a carrier frequency of 1 in 25 (Rosenstein and Langbaum, 1984). The availability of three-generation families with multiple affected offspring made CF a prime candidate for the application of linkage analysis and molecular genetics for the cloning of the gene (reviewed in Dean, 1988). A series of reports published in 1985 demonstrated that the CF gene was located on the long arm of  Cell 864  B  t Figure  1. SSCP Analysis  of Regions  of the CF Gene  DNA from several CF patients who are not homozygous for the common mutation were assayed for SSCPs in exons of the CF gene.

Multipoint linkage analysis placed the gene between the met proto-oncogene and the anonymous marker D7S8 (Beaudet et al., 1986; Lathrop et al., 1988). The region containing the gene was refined by cloning CpG-rich islands of DNA, chromosome jumping and walking, and mapping of recombinant meioses (Estivifl et al., 1987; lannuzzi et al., 1989; Dean et al., 1990). The CF gene was isolated in 1989, from lung cell and sweat duct cDNA libraries, and shown to encode an approximately 170 kd protein related to a family of membrane-bound active transport molecules (Rommens et al., 1989; Riordan et al., 1989; Kerem et al., 1989b). A three nucleotide deletion in a putative ATP binding domain is found in 70% of CF chromosomes. This mutation occurs in the tenth exon of the gene and removes a phenylalanine codon at position 508 (AFso8) in a putative ATP binding domain. Results Identification of Patients Carrying Nucleotide Alterations We have employed a sensitive assay to examine a group of patients who do not contain the common mutation on one or both chromosomes in an attempt to identify additional mutations in the gene. Orita et al. (1989a, 1989b) recently described a technique that detects point mutations in defined stretches of DNA. This method identifies singlestranded conformation polymorphisms (SSCPs), by the amplification of 100-400 bp segments of radiolabeled DNA, which are subsequently denatured and electrophoresed on high resolution, nondenaturing acrylamide gels. Under these conditions each strand of the DNA fragment can fold back on itself in a unique conformation. Mutations within a DNA segment will often alter the secondary structure of the molecule and affect its electrophoretic mobility. We have used SSCP analysis for 46 CF patients who have at least one CF allele that does not contain the com-  mon (AF,& mutation. We designed primers to amplify coding regions of the gene from the published sequence of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Speculating that the transmembrane regions may be sites for mutations, we chose the larger exons in the regions of the gene containing the putative membranespanning domains for study. Figure 1 shows an SSCP analysis of exons 4 and 7 performed on several patients. One individual can be identified, for each exon, that contains an aberrantly migrating fragment. Of the 46 patients examined, three patients were identified with alterations in exon 4. Only one individual was found with an exon 7 alteration. Each putative mutation was shown to segregate with the disease in the families of these patients (Figure 2). Each of the exon 4 and 7 aberrant fragments occurred on a CF chromosome that does not contain the AFso8 mutation. The alterations were more precisely mapped to determine whether the individuals with aberrant exon 4 fragments all carry the same mutation. The alteration in pedigree BOS 7 mapped to a different region of exon 4 than did the UT 1425 or the BOS 42 mutation, and the fragments migrated to a different position on the SSCP gels (data not shown). This suggested that the exon 4 alterations are due to at least two independent mutations in the three families. Nucleotide Sequences of the Alterations The amplified DNA was directly sequenced in order to determine the nucleotide changes responsible for the mobility shifts. In each case we obtained a single ladder of DNA sequence that exactly matched the published sequence at all but a single nucleotide position (Figures 3 and 4). Individuals from pedigree UT 1425 and BOS 42 showed the identical mutation, a G to A transition at nucleotide 482 in exon 4. This mutation changes an arginine codon to histidine; it will be referred to as R117H. The mutation in BOS 7 is a C to G transversion in exon 4 that replaces an aspartic acid residue with histidine (DllOH). Family UT 1446 contains a C to G transversion at position 1172 that changes an aspartic acid residue to proline (R347P). This latter mutation destroys an Hhal restriction site and creates an Ncol site. Thus each of the nucleotide sequence alterations that we detected by the SSCP method does in fact result in an amino acid replacement in the CFTR gene. All amino acid changes in polypeptides do not result in functional alterations. To provide further evidence that these mutations cause disease, we analyzed 86 two- and three-generation CF families to determine if these alterations occur on normal chromosomes. Because CF is a common recessive disease, only normal chromosomes from documented carriers can be used as a source of non-CF alleles. Since the carriers are healthy, they must possess a normal chromosome. None of the exon 4 or 7 mutations were found in greater than 272 normal chromosomes from carrier parents and grandparents. A more rigorous test would employ the examination of sufficient normal chromosomes of the same haplotype as the mutant allele to ensure that the mutation was not a neutral sequence polymorphism occurring on a rare haplotype.

These restriction fragment length polymorphisms are in tight linkage disequilibrium with each other (A = 0.85; Estivill et al., 1987). In addition, they show a high allelic association with CF (A = 0.77-0.88; Kerem et al., 1989a). For all three mutations, we analyzed a -/fold excess of normal versus CF chromosomes-a statistically significant number (Table 1). As further evidence that the mutated amino acids are functionally important, we exam-  ined the conservation of these regions across several vertebrate species. Using the same polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and amplification conditions employed for human DNA, we obtained pure, correctly sized product from most species tested (data not shown). We directly sequenced the DNA from the most divergent species, mouse and frog (Xenopus), using the exon 7 primers (Figure 48). The two assayed regions are remarkably conserved, displaying over 90% identity at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels. The Arg residue, altered in CF,  Cell  866  GATC  GATC  Normal Figure  is conserved in both the rodent and amphibian sequences. The sequence for exon 4 was not obtained for mouse and frog, but the Asp-110 and Arg-117 residues are conserved in several mammalian species (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that these amino acids play a critical role in the structure and/or function of CFTR. Therefore, we conclude that the mutations we have described cause disease, although additional population data and a functional assay for the gene will be required to demonstrate this rigorously.

Even though there are no physical data on the structure of the CFTR protein, its similarity to other members of the membrane transport family strongly suggests that this protein is embedded in the plasma membrane. Although few membrane proteins have actually been crystallized, transmembrane segments are generally thought to consist of approximately 20 amino acids arranged in an a helix. A number of computer algorithms have been developed that employ the hydrophobicity of portions of amino acids to predict the presence of transmembrane domains (Eisenberg, 1984; Engelman et al., 1986). Two of the mutations described here replace highly polar amino acids in a domain that is predicted to lie outside of the cell (Riordan et al., 1989). This region of 15 residues contains 7 charged amino acids and would be unlikely to lie within the membrane (Figure 4). The third change (CF R347P) replaces an arginine with a proline residue. This amino acid is predicted to lie inside of the sixth transmembrane segment. The function of the CFTR molecule is still unclear. Although the defective transport of chloride ions is the most well characterized abnormality in CF epithelial cells, aberrant transport of sodium, bicarbonate, and sulfated molecules have also been seen in CF cells and tissues (Boucher et al., 1988; Kopelman et al., 1989). Furthermore, a chloride transport complex has been purified from bovine cells and appears to be composed of multiple polypeptides that are smaller than CFTR (Landry et al., 1989). All of the genes related to CFTR encode proteins involved  fected. In family UT 1425, the three older affected children remained undiagnosed until the two younger siblings were determined to have CF at the ages of 22 and 23. In the BOS 42 family, one of the affected patients (#2) is 26 years old and has a very mild disease phenotype. Thus the two families with the same pair of mutations (AF508 and CF R117H) both contain at least one individual with exceptionally mild disease. Discussion Using a rapid and sensitive assay we have identified three point mutations that cause amino acid replacements in the coding region of the N-terminal portion of the CFTR gene. Three observations support the proposition that these mutations are responsible for disease: the mutations have not been found on over 94 normal chromosomes of the same haplotype; the mutations cause the replacement of highly charged amino acids that are highly conserved in vertebrates; and two families that carry the same combination of mutations (AFSo8 and CF R117H) show mild clinical features.

Status  Cell 868  in extracellular transport, although none of these polypeptides are involved in ion flux. Thus it is still unclear whether CFTR transports chloride ions or whether it regulates chloride flux in a less direct fashion. There are several possible mechanisms that could explain the effect of the mutations described here on the CF gene. The charged side chains that are replaced could be involved in interactions with the molecule being transported by the channel; the mutations could cause structural alterations in the protein; the replaced residues may be involved in interactions with other proteins; or they could be critical for the proper anchoring of the transmembrane domains in the membrane. The examination of the ion transport properties of cells from these patients should help distinguish these possibilities. We identified different mutations in two of the four families that have at least one individual characterized as PS. Thus there would appear to be at least three mutations that are responsible for this milder form of the disease, although all four families have a haplotype with the one allele for MPGd (Table 3). However, family BOS 42 clearly demonstrates that other factors (genetic and/or environmental) must play a role in the course of the disease. The oldest child in this family has severe, chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of the lung resulting in moderately abnormal pulmonary function and mild pancreatic and liver disease. In contrast, her younger sister at age 26 has virtually no signs of CF, apart from an elevated sweat chloride level. The more severely affected child also has a much higher sweat chloride value, suggesting that other genes participate in the control of ion transport. The mutations we have described here are rare and may each account for only 1% or 2% of CF chromosomes. However, these mutations could be more frequent in more geographically restricted populations. A consortium of 41 laboratories from 14 countries has been formed, with a combined patient base of over 9,000, to provide accurate population data on CF mutations. The R347P mutation can be directly assayed by restriction digestion and the others by allele-specific oligonucleotides. All of the families in this study are of Caucasian origin. The paternal grandfather of UT 1446 is of German/French extraction. The father of BOS 7 is of Irish/English descent. We do not know the ethnic background of the other families Given the large size of the CF gene and the presence of deletions (Riordan et al., 1989), frameshift mutations (White et al., 1990), and point mutations (this report) in both the transmembrane and intracellular portions of the molecule, it seems likely there will be a large number of CF mutations. This may make it more difficult to screen for all of the mutations in large populations of patients. The AFso8 mutation accounts for approximately 70% of CF chromosomes, and about one-half of CF patients are homozygous for this mutation (Kerem et al., 1989b; Lemna et al., 1990; Dean et al., submitted). Therefore, at least 40% of patients are likely to be compound heterozygotes. CF patients heterozygous for AFso8 demonstrate a broad range of severity and include both pancreatic insufficient and PS cases. The two families with the R117H mutation provide a clear example that clinical characterization of  each combination of compound heterozygote may be important in predicting the severity of individual patients. It is unclear what the symptoms of a homozygote for the mutations described here would be. Such an individual could go undiagnosed or could present mild pulmonary, fertility, and/or pancreatic complications. The identification of these mild variants will allow this to be tested directly. Many techniques exist for detecting point mutations in nucleic acids, but SSCP analysis has many advantages. Samples are taken directly from the thermal cycler to electrophoresis on easily prepared gels. No extensive treatment of the sample or special equipment is required as in other methods. While no information on the position of the mutation is obtained and the fragments should be less than 400 bp, the amplified product can be digested to further localize the mutation. It is uncertain what percentage of mutations will be detected by this method. Orita et al. (1989b) were able to detect all four ras mutations that they directly assayed as well as a mutation of an Mspl site. While all three mutations described here represent replacements of G residues, Orita et al. (1989b) detected A to T, C to A, G to A, G to T, and C to T mutations. Single nucleotide deletions can also be detected as SSCPs (M. Dean and M. White, unpublished data). This method should be applicable to any source of nucleic acid, including viruses, plasmids, and tumors. Because the assay is for aberrantly migrating strands, mixed cell populations such as tumors infiltrated with normal cells could be assayed. It was recently proposed that a data base should be generated of small stretches of human DNA segments defined by PCR primers (sequence-tagged sites) in order to facilitate the physical mapping of the genome (Olson et al., 1989). Sequence-tagged sites should be readily amenable to SSCP analysis, and the detection of polymorphisms in them would allow physical maps of the human genome to be combined with the genetic maps. Experimental  Procedures  Identification of SSCPs PCRs were performed with 100 ng of genomic DNA, 70 mM dNTPs, 0.1 pl of [32P]dCTP (3000 Cilmmol), 10 mM Tris (pli 8.8), 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgQ, 0.01% gelatin, and 1 U of Taq polymerase. For exon 4, primers CF-32 (5’-AGTCACCAAAGCAGTACAGC) and CF-33 (5’-GCTATTCTCATCTGCATTCC) were used, and CF-34 (5’CAGAACTGAAACT. GACTCGG) and CF-35 (5’TGCTCCAAGAGAGTCATACC) were used to amplify exon 7. The reaction (1 ~1) was added to sequencing stop solution (9 ~1) (Sambrook et al., 1989) in a 96-well tray and placed in a pan of water that had been heated to boiling. After 2 min the tray was removed to room temperature and 2 ~1 loaded onto 5% acrylamide-TEE gels at 50 W in a cold room for 3 hr. Alternatively, 10% glycerol was added to the gel, which was run at room temperature at 20 W for 6 hr. The gels were dried and autoradiography was performed, with an intensifying screen for 12-72 hr. Complete denaturation was not always achieved. To map mutations further, the PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes and electrophoresed on 20 cm acrylamide gels. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide and the bands excised and soaked in 100 ul of water at 65% for 1 hr. The eluate was dried, resuspended in stop solution, and electrophoresed as described above. Direct Sequencing Double-stranded PCR products  were  eluted  from acrylamide  as de-  Mutations 869  in Mildly Affected  CF Patients  scribed above and 5 pl was used in a 40 cycle PCR with a 25- to 50-fold reduction of one of the primers. The resulting single-stranded DNA was purified with a Centricon 100 column (Amicon) and 5 pl sequenced with Sequenase (U.S. Biochemicals). Single-stranded material that showed a clean band on an acrylamide gel typically yielded the clearest sequence. The individuals whose DNA was sequenced are as follows: UT 1425, 1376; UT 1446, 1736; BOS 7, 150; BOS 42, 526. Sequence was determined in both directions for all four individuals. The R347P mutation was confirmed by Hhal and Ncol digestion of amplified DNA The DllOH and R117H mutations were confirmed by hybridization at 42% with CF-49 (5’TCCTATCACCCGGAT) and CF-48 (5’.GAGGAACACTCTATC). respectively (data not shown). The filters were washed for 10 min at 42%.

"1","Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency caused by deletion of a 7-bp repeat sequence in the E1 alpha gene.A 7-bp deletion in the X-chromosomal pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) E1 alpha gene was characterized in a female patient with the "cerebral" form of PDH deficiency. The mutation was localized using the chemical cleavage method and further characterized by application of the polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. This 7-bp sequence is found in the normal gene as a direct tandem repeat. The deletion causes a change in the reading frame. Results have shown that the level of normal sized PDH E1 alpha in the fibroblast sample was approximately 30% of that of normal controls. This is consistent with normal transcription from the X chromosome carrying the nonmutated form of the E1 alpha subunit, as this chromosome is active in approximately 30% of this patient's cells. The severity of PDH E1 alpha deficiency in affected females is to a large extent dependent on the X-chromosome inactivation pattern in the brain. The clinical picture might therefore vary significantly between patients with the same mutation. We show that the 7-bp deletion must be a de novo mutation, because it is not present in the parent's X chromosomes. Furthermore, the deletion was not detected in chorionic villus samples in two subsequent pregnancies."

C  YSTIC FIBROSIS (CF) IS AN AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE GENET-  ic disorder affecting a number of organs, including the lung airways, pancreas, and sweat glands (1). Abnormally high electrical potential differences have been detected across the epithelial surfaces of the CF respiratory tract, including the trachea and nasal polyps, as well as across the walls of CF sweat gland secretory coils and reabsorptive ducts (2). The basic defect has been associated with decreased chloride ion conductance across the apical membrane of the epithelial cells (3). That the defect also appeared to persist in cultured cells derived from several epithelial tissues suggested that the CF gene is expressed in these cells (4). More recently, patch clamp studies showed that this defect is probably due to a failure of an outwardly rectifying anion channel to respond to phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) or protein kinase C (5).

IO66  isolation of polypeptide components of an epithelial chloride channel that mediates conductance (6), their relation to the kinaseactivated pathway and CF has yet to be established, and the basic biochemical defect in CF remains unknown. Molecular cloning experiments have permitted the isolation of a large, contiguous segment of DNA spanning at least four transcribed sequences from a region thought to contain the CF locus (7). These sequences were initially identified on the basis of their ability to detect conserved sequences in other animal species by DNA hybridization and were subsequently characterized by RNA hybridization experiments, cDNA isolation, and direct DNA sequence analysis (7). Three of the transcribed regions were excluded from being the CF locus by earlier genetic or DNA sequence analyses (7, 8). The fourth one, as shown by genetic analysis (9) and DNA sequencing analysis presented below, corresponds to a portion of the CF gene locus. Isolation of cDNA clones. Two DNA segments (E4.3 and H1.6) that detected cross-species hybridization signals (7) were used as probes to screen cDNA libraries made from several tissues and cell types (10). After screening seven different libraries, one single clone (10-1) was isolated with H1.6 from a cDNA library made from the cultured epithelial cells of the sweat glands of an unaffected (nonCF) individual (10). DNA sequencing showed that 10-1 contained an insert of 920 base pairs (bp) in size and one potential, long open reading frame (ORF). Since one end of the sequence shared perfect sequence identity with H1.6, it was concluded that the cDNA clone was probably derived from this region. The DNA sequence in common was, however, only 113 bp long (Figs. 1 and 2). This sequence in fact corresponded to the first axon of the putative CF gene. The short sequence overlap thus explained the weak hybridization signals in library screening and our inability to detect transcripts in RNA gel-blot analysis. In addition, the orientation of the transcription unit was tentatively established on the basis of alignment of the genomic DNA sequence with the presumptive ORF of 10-1. Since the corresponding transcript was estimated to be about 6500 nucleotides in length by RNA gel-blot hybridization experiments, further cDNA library screening was required in order to clone the remainder of the coding region. As a result of several successive screenings with cDNA libraries generated from the colon carcinoma cell line T84, normal and CF sweat gland cells, pancreas, SCIENCE, VOL. 245  Downloaded from on April 4, 2016  JOHN R.

COLLINS, LAP-CHEE Tsui  (Fig. 3). The analysis revealed a prominent band, about size, in T84 cells. Identical results were obtained with other cDNA clones as probes. Similar, strong hybridization signals were also detected in pancreas and primary cultures of cells from nasal polyps, suggesting that the mature mRNA of the putative CF signals, probably repregene is about 6.5 kb. Minor hybridization were detected at the lower size senting degradation products, basis ranges, but they varied between different experiments. Onwiththe those of the hybridization band intensity and comparison detected for other transcripts under identical experimental condiit was estimated that the putative CF gene transcripts tions, constituted about 0.01 percent of total mRNA in T84 cells. Additional tissues were analyzed by RNA gel-blot hybridization in an attempt to correlate the expression pattern of the putative CF and the pathology of CF. Transcripts, all of identical size, were gene found in lung, colon, sweat glands (cultured epithelial cells), and parotid gland, but the signal in these tissues was placenta, liver, weaker than that detected in the pancreas and nasal polyps generally varied among different preparations; for example, (Fig. 3). Intensity in kidney was not detectable in the preparation shown hybridization in Fig. 3 but was clearly discernible subsequently. Transcripts were and the probe 6.5 kb in  and adult lungs, 18 additional clones were isolated (Fig. 1). DNA sequence analysis revealed that none of these cDNA clones corresponded to the length of the observed transcript, but it was possible to derive a consensus sequence based on overlapping regions. Further cDNA clones corresponding to the 5' and 3' ends of the transcript were derived from 5' and 3' primer-extension experiments (Fig. 1). Together, these clones span about 6.1 kb and contain an ORF capable of encoding a protein of 1480 amino acids (Fig. 2). It was unusual that most of the cDNA clones isolated here contained sequence insertions at various locations (Fig. 1).While many of these extra sequences corresponded to intron regions reverse-transcribed during the construction of the cDNA, as revealed on alignment with genomic DNA sequences, the identities of several others were uncertain because they did not align with sequences at the corresponding exon-intron junctions, namely, the sequences at the 5' ends of clones 13a and T16-1 and at the 5' and 3' ends of TI1, and the insertions between exons 3 and 4 in 13a and between exons 10 and 11 in T16-4.5 (legend to Fig. 1). More puzzling were the sequences corresponding to the reverse complement of exon 6 at the 5' end of1 la and the insertion of a segment of a bacterial transposon in clone C16-1; none of these could be explained by mRNA processing errors. In that the number of recombinant cDNA clones for the putative CF gene detected in the library screening was much less than would have been expected from the abundance of transcripts estimated from RNA hybridization experiments, it seemed probable that the clones that contained aberrant structures were preferentially retained while the proper clones were lost during propagation. Consistent with this interpretation, poor growth was observed for most of our recombinant clones isolated, regardless of the vector used. RNA analysis. To visualize the transcript of the putative CF gene, we used RNA gel-blot hybridization with the 10-1 cDNA as Fig. 1. Overlapping cDNA clones aligned with genomic DNA fragments. The cDNA clones are represented by open boxes with exons indicated. The corresponding genomic Eco RI fragments are schematically presented on the bottom, with lengths in kilobases.

Nucleotide sequence of cDNA encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator together with the deduced amino acid sequence. DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method (34) with 35S-labeled nucleotides or by the Dupont Genesis2000 automatic DNA sequencer. Numbers on the left of columns indicate base positions and numbers on the right amino acid residue positions. The first base position corresponds to the first nucleotide in the 5' extension clone PA3-5, which is one nucleotide longer than TB2-7 (12). The 3' end and the noncoding sequence are shown above [nucleotides 4561 to 6129 plus the poly(A) tail]. Arrows indicate position of transcription initiation site by primer extention analysis (11). Nucleotide 6129 is followed by a poly(A) tract. Positions of exon junctions are indicated by vertical lines. Potential membrane-spanning segments ascertained with the use of the algorithm of Eisenberg et al. (35) are enclosed in boxes. Amino acids comprising putative ATP-binding folds are underlined. Possible sites of phosphorylation (21) by protein kinases A or C are indicated by open and closed circles, respectively. The open triangle indicates the position at which 3 bp are deleted in CF. Abbreviations for the amino acid residues are: A, Ala; C, Cys; D, Asp; E, Glu; F, Phe; G, Gly; H, His; I, Ile; K, Lys; L, Leu; M, Met; N, Asn; P, Pro; Q, Gln; R, Arg; S, Ser; T, Thr; V, Val; W, Trp; and Y, Tyr.  coding region of the CF locus could be deduced from overlapping cDNA clones. Since most of the cDNA clones were apparently derived from unprocessed transcripts, further studies were performed to ensure the authenticity of the consensus sequence. Each cDNA clone was first tested for chromosome localization by hybridization analysis with a human-hamster somatic cell hybrid containing a single human chromosome 7 and by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (7). The ones that did not map to the correct region on chromosome 7 were not pursued. Fine restriction enzyme mapping was then performed for each clone. While overlapping regions were clearly identified for most of the clones, many contained single copy, additional regions not readily recognizable by  18S;0 1  The cDNA was fither characterized in gel hybridization experiFive to six different restriction fragments could be detected with the 10-1 cDNA in Eco RI- or Hind IIIdigested total human DNA and a similar number of fragments with several other cDNA clones, suggesting the presence of multiple exons for the putative CF gene. The hybridization studies also identified the cDNA clones with unprocessed intron sequences when they showed preferential hybridization to a smaller subset of genomic DNA fragments with relatively greater intensities. For the confirmed cDNA clones, their corresponding genomic DNA segments were isolated (7) and the exons and exon-intron boundaries were sequenced. In all, 24 exons were identified (Fig. 2). Physical mapping experiments (7) showed that the gene locus spanned about 250 kb. The 5' terminus of the transcript was determined by primer extension (11). A modified polymerase chain reaction, anchored PCR (12), was also used to facilitate cloning of the 5' end sequences. ments with genomic DNA.  8 SEPTEMBER I989  6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17  3 4 5  Fig. 3. RNA gel-blot analysis. Hybridization by the cDNA clone 10-1 to a 6.5-kb transcript is shown in the tissues indicated. RNA samples were prepared from cells and tissue samples obtained from surgical pathology or at autopsy according to the methods described in (10). Total RNA (10 ,ug) from each tissue and 1 ,g of poly(A) + RNA from T84 cells were separated on formaldehyde gels and transferred onto nylon membranes (Zetaprobe, Bio-Rad), which were hybridized with DNA probes labeled to high specific activity by the random priming method (36, 37).

The left panel shows the sequences from the coding strands obtained with the B primer (5'-GTlTlCCTGGATTATGCCTGGGCAC-3') and the right panel those from the opposite strand with the D primer (5'-GTITGGCATGCTlllGATGACGCITC-3'). The brackets indicate the three nucleotides in the normal that are absent in CF (arrowheads). Sequencing was performed as described in (34).  Two independent 5' extension clones, one from pancreas and the other from T84 RNA, were characterized by DNA sequencing and differed by only 1 base in length, thus establishing the most probable initiation site for the transcript (Fig. 2). Since the initial cDNA clones did not contain a poly(A) + tail indicative ofthe end of a mRNA, anchored PCR was also applied to the 3' end of the transcript (12). The results derived from the use of several different 3 '-extending oligonucleotides were consistent with the interpretaRESEARCH ARTICLES  I069  tion that the end of the transcript was about 1.2 kb downstream of the Hind III site at nucleotide position 5027 (Fig. 2). The complete cDNA sequence spans 6129 base pairs excluding the poly(A)+ tail at the end of the 3' untranslated region and it contains an ORF capable of encoding a polypeptide of 1480 amino acids (Fig. 2). An ATG (AUG) triplet is present at the beginning of this ORF (base position 133-135). Since the nucleotide sequence surrounding this codon (5'-AGACCAUGCA-3') has the proposed features of the consensus sequence (CC)ACCAUGG(G) of a eukaryotic translation initiation site (13), with a highly conserved A at the -3 position, it is highly probable that this AUG corresponds to the first methionine codon for the putative polypeptide.

Alignment of the three most conserved segments of the amino acid sequences (single letter code) of the extended NBF's of CFTR with comparable regions of other proteins. These three segments consist of residues 433 to 473, 488 to 513, and 542 to 584 of the amino-terminal (N) half and 1219 to 1259, 1277 to 1302, and 1340 to 1382 of the carboxvlterminal (C) half of CFTR. The heavy overlining points out the regions of greatest similarity. The star indicates the position corresponding to the phenylalanine that is deleted in CF. Additional general homology can be seen even with the introduction of very few gaps. The other sequences are of proteins involved in multidrug resistance in human (hmdrl), mouse (mmdr 1 and 2) (16), and Plasmodium falciparum (pfmdr) (38); the a-factor pheromone export system of yeast (STE6) (39); the hemolysin (hlyB) system of E. I070  sequences derived from CF and unaffected (N) individuals was next conducted. Two clones, C16-1 and Cl-1/5, were derived from a CF sweat gland cDNA library and together they spanned almost the entire coding region. The most striking difference between CF and N sequences was a 3-bp deletion (Fig. 4), which would result in a loss of a phenylalanine residue (position 508) in the predicted CF polypeptide. This deletion (AF508) was detected in both CF clones. To exclude the possibility that this difference was due to a cloning artifact, sequence-specific oligonucleotides were used to screen DNA samples from CF families. Specific hybridization could be observed for each oligonucleotide probe with genomic DNA amplified by PCR, confirming the presence of corresponding genomic DNA sequences (9). Furthermore, the oligonucleotide specific for the 3-bp deletion hybridized to 68 percent of chromosomes carrying a CF mutation but not to any of the normal chromosomes (0/198), an indication that a silent sequence polymorphism was unlikely. Sequence differences found elsewhere among the different cDNA clones probably represented sequence polymorphisms or cDNA cloning artifacts (14). Predicted protein structure. Analysis of the sequence of the overlapping cDNA clones (Fig. 2) predicted a polypeptide of 1480 amino acids with a molecular mass of 168,138 daltons. The most characteristic feature of the predicted protein is the presence of two repeated motifs, each of which consists of a domain capable of spanning the membrane several times and sequences resembling consensus nucleotide (ATP)-binding folds (NBF's) (15) (Figs. 5 and 6). These characteristics are remarkably similar to those of the mammalian multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (16) and a number of other membrane-associated proteins (as discussed below), suggesting that the predicted CF gene product is likely to be involved in the transport of substances (ions) across the membrane and is probably a member of a membrane protein superfamily (17). For the convenience of future discussion and to avoid confusion with the previously named CF protein and CF factor (18), we will call the  -  -  GEGGITLSGGQRARISLARAVYKDADLYLLDSPFGYLDVLTEK  VDGGCVLSHGHKQLMCLARSVLSKAKILLLDEPSAHLDPVTYQ GERGAQLSGGQKQRIAIARALVRNPKILLLDEATSALDTESEA GDKGTLLSGGQKQRIAIARALVRQPHILLLDEATSALDTESEK GERGAQLSGGQKQRIAIARALVRNPKILLLDEATSALDTESEA GDKGTQLSGGQKQRIAIARALVRQPHILLLDEATSALDTESEK GDRGAQLSGGQKQRIAIARALVRNPKILLLDEATSALDTESEA GDKGTQLSGGQKQRIAIARALIRQPRVLLLDEATSALDTESEK GSNASKLSGGQKQRISIARAIMRNPKILILDEATSSLDNKSEY PYGKS-LSGGQKQRIAIARALLREPKILLLDEATSSLDSNSEK GTGGVTLSGGQQQRVAIARAFIRDTPILFLDEAVSALDIVHRN RIDTTLLSGGQAQRLCIARALLRKSKILILDECTSALDSVSSS GEQGAGLSGGQRQRIAIARALVNNPKILIFDEATSALDYASEH PGRVKGLSGGERKRLAFASEALTDPPLLICDEPTSGLDSFTAH  FEYPAQLSGGQKQRVALARSLAIQPDLLL-DEPFGALDGELRR GRSTNQLSGGEWQRVRLAAVVLQITLLLLDEPMNSLDVAQQSA HQSGYSLSGGQQQRLCIARGIAIRPEVLLLDEPCSALDPISTG GKYPVHLSGGQQQRVSIARALAMEPDVLLFDEPTSALDPELVG DRKPKALSGGQRQRVAIGRTLVAEPSVFLLDEPLSNLDAALRV KMYPHEFSGGMRQRVMIAMALLCRPKLLIADEPTTALDVTVQA NRYPHEFSGGQCQRIGIARALILEPKLIICDDAVSALDVSIQA DKLVGDLSIGDQQMVEIAKVLSFESKVIIMDEPTCALIDTETE EQAIGLLSGGNQQKVAIARGLMTRPKVLILDEPTPGVDVGAKK GQSATTLSGGEAQRVKLARELSKRGLYILDEPTTGLHFADIQQ NTRVADLSGGMKRRLTLAGALINDPQLLILDEPTTGLDPHARH KNFPIQLSGGEQQRVGIARAVVNKPAVLLADEPTGNLDDALSE  coli (22); screening of eye pigments in Drosophila (White) (23); an unknown liverwort chloroplast function (Mbpx) (25); vitamin B12 transport in E. coli (BtuD) (24); phosphate transport in E. coli (PstB) (40); histidine transport in Salmonella typhimurium (hisP) (41); maltose transport in E. coli (malK) (42); oligopeptide transport in S. typhimurium (oppD and oppF) (43); ribose transport in E. coli (RbsA) (44). UvrA is one component of an E. coli DNA repair system (45); NodI is a gene product involved in nodulation in Rhizobium (46); FtsE is a protein that contributes to the regulation of cell division (47). In addition to these proteins that contain this long NBF, there is a large number of others that contain the two short nucleotide binding motifs A and B initially pointed out by Walker et al. (48). Further, there are other proteins containing only motif A or B (49). SCIENCE, VOL. 245  putative CF gene product the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Each of the predicted membrane-associated regions of CFTR consists of six hydrophobic segments capable of spanning a lipid bilayer (19), which are followed by a large hydrophilic region containing the NBF's (Fig. 5). On the basis of sequence alignment with other nucleotide-binding proteins, each of the putative NBF's in CFTR comprises at least 150 residues (Fig. 6). The single residue deletion (AF508) detected in most of the CF patients is in the first NBF, between the two most highly conserved segments within this sequence. The amino acid sequence identity between the region surrounding the AF508 mutation and the corresponding regions of several other proteins suggests that this region is of functional importance (Fig. 6). A hydrophobic amino acid, usually one with an aromatic side chain, is present in most of these proteins at the position corresponding to Phe508 of CFTR. Despite the overall symmetry in the two-motif structure of the protein and the sequence conservation of the NBF's, sequence identity between the two motifs of the predicted CFTR protein is modest. The strongest identity is between sequences at the carboxyl ends of the NBF's. Of the 66 residues aligned within these regions, 27 percent are identical and 11 percent are functionally similar. The overall, weak internal sequence identity is in contrast to the much higher degree (>70 percent) in P-glycoprotein for which a sequence duplication hypothesis has been proposed (16). The lack of conservation in the relative positions of the exon-intron boundaries in the CF gene also argues against recent exon duplication as a mechanism in the evolution of this gene (Fig. 2). Since there is apparently no signal-peptide sequence at the amino terminus of CFTR (Fig. 7), the highly charged hydrophilic segment preceding the first transmembrane sequence is probably oriented in the cytoplasm. Each of the two sets of hydrophobic helices are expected to form three traversing loops across the membrane and little of the sequence of the entire protein is expected to be exposed to the exterior surface, except the region between transmembrane segments 7 and 8. It is of interest that the latter region contains two potential sites for N-linked glycosylation (20). A highly charged cytoplasmic domain can be identified in the middle of the predicted CFTR polypeptide, linking the two halves of the protein. This domain, named the R domain, is operationally defined by a single large exon in which 69 ofthe 241 amino acids are polar residues arranged in alternating clusters of positive and negative charges. Moreover, nine of the ten sites at which there are consensus sequences for phosphorylation by protein kinase A and seven of the potential substrate sites for protein kinase C found in CFTR are located in this exon (21). Properties of CFTR could be further derived from comparison to other membrane-associated proteins (Fig. 6). In addition to the overall structural similarity with P-glycoproteins, each of the two predicted motifs in CFTR shows resemblance to the single motif structure of hemolysin B of Escherichia coli (22) and the product of the White gene of Drosophila (23). These proteins are involved in the transport of the lytic peptide of the hemolysin system and of eye pigment molecules, respectively. The vitamin B12 transport system of E. coli, BtuD (24), and MbpX (25), which is a liverwort chloroplast gene product whose function is unknown, also have a similar structural motif. Further, CFTR shares structural similarity with several of the periplasmic solute transport systems of Gramnegative bacteria, where the transmembrane region and the ATPbinding folds are contained in separate proteins that function in concert with a third substrate-binding polypeptide (26). The overall structural arrangement of the transmembrane domains in CFTR is similar to several cation channel proteins (27) and some cation-translocating adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) (28) 8 SEPTEMBER i989  Fig. 7.

Short regions of sequence identity have also been detected between the putative transmembrane regions of CFTR and other membrane-spanning proteins (30). In addition, a sequence of 18 amino acids situated approximately 50 residues from the carboxyl terminus of CFTR shows some identity (12/18) with the raf serinethreonine kinase proto-oncogene product of Xenopus laevis (31). Finally, a sequence identity (10 of 13 amino acid residues) has been noted between a hydrophilic segment (position 701 to 713) within the highly charged R domain of CFTR and a region immediately preceding the first transmembrane loop of the sodium channels in both rat brain and eel (32). This feature of CFTR is not shared with the topologically closely related P-glycoprotein; the 241-amino acid linking peptide is apparently the major difference between the two proteins. Relevance to the CF anion transport defect. In view of the genetic data of Kerem et al. (9) and the tissue specificity and predicted properties of the CFTR protein, it is reasonable to conclude that CFTR is directly responsible for CF. It remains unclear, however, how CFTR is involved in the reg-ulation of ion conductance across the apical membrane of epithelial cells. It is possible that CFTR serves as an ion channel itself. For example, 10 of the 12 putative transmembrane regions contain one or more amino acids with charged side chains (Fig. 7), a property similar to that of the brain sodium channel and the -y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor chloride channel subunits, where charged residues are present in four of the six, and three of the four, respective membrane-associated domains per subunit or repeat unit (32, 33). The amphipathic nature of these transmembrane segments is believed to contribute to the channel-forming capacity of these molecules. In contrast, the closely related P-glycoprotein, which is RESEARCH ARTICLES  107I  not believed to conduct ions, has only two charged residues in all 12 transmembrane domains. Alternatively, CFTR may not be an ion channel but instead it may serve to regulate ion channel activities. In support of the latter possibility, none of the recently purified polypeptides (from trachea and kidney) that are capable of reconstituting chloride channels in lipid membranes (6) appear to be CFTR, judged on the basis of molecular mass. . In any case, the presence of ATP-binding domains in CFTR suggests that ATP hydrolysis is directly involved and required for the transport function. The high density of phosphorylation sites for protein kinases A and C and the clusters of charged residues in the R domain may both serve to regulate this activity. The deletion of Phe508 in the NBF may prevent proper binding of ATP or the conformational change required for normal CFTR activity, consequently resulting in the observed insensitivity to activation by protein kinase A- or protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of the CF apical chloride conductance pathway (5). Since the predicted structure of CFTR contains several conserved domains and belongs to a family of proteins, most of which function as parts of multicomponent molecular systems (15), the CFTR protein may also participate in epithelial cell functions not related to ion transport. To understand the basic defect in CF, it is necessary to determine the precise role of Phe508 in the regulation of ion transport and to understand the mechanism that leads to the pathophysiology of the disease. With the CF gene (that is, the cDNA) now isolated, it should be possible to elucidate the control of ion transport pathways in epithelial cells in general. Knowledge gained from study ofthe CF gene product (CFIR), both the normal and mutant forms, will provide a molecular basis for the development of improved means of treatment of the disease.

The cDNA libraries from cultured epithelial cells were prepared as follows: sweat gland cells derived from a non-CF individual and from a CF patient were grown to first passage as described [G. Collie, M. Buchwald, P. Harper, J. R. Riordan, In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 21, 592 (1985)]. The presence in these cells of an outwardly rectifying Cl- channel was confirmed (J. A. Tabcharani, T. J. Jensen, J. R. Riordan, J. W. Hanrahan, J. Membrane Biol., in press), but the CF cells were insensitive to activation by cyclic AMP [T. J. Jensen, J. W. Hanrahan, J. A. Tabcharani, M. Buchwald, J. R. Riordan, Pediatric Pulmonol. Suppl. 2, 100 (1988)]. Polyadenylated RNA was isolated [J. M. Chirgwin, A. E. Przybyla, R. J. Macdonald, W. J. Rutter, Biochemistry 18, 5294 (1979); H. Aviv and P. Leder, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 69, 1408 (1972)] and used as template for the synthesis of cDNA according to U. Gubler and B. Hoffman [Gene 25, 263 (1983)]. After methylation of internal Eco RI sites, ends were made flush with T4 DNA polymerase, and phosphorylated Eco RI linkers were added to the cDNA. After digestion with Eco RI and removal of excess linkers, the cDNA products were ligated into the Eco RI site of X ZAP (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The same procedures were used to construct a library from RNA isolated from preconfluent cultures of the T84 colon carcinoma cell line [K. Dharmsathaphorn, J. A. McRoberts, K. G. Mandel, L. D. Tisdale, H. Masui, Am. J. Physiol. 246, G204 (1984)]. The numbers of independent recombinants in the three libraries were: 2.0 x 106 for the non-CF sweat gland cells, 4.5 x 106 for the CF sweat gland cells, and  1072  15. 16. 17.  3.2 x 10' from T84 cells. Standard procedures were used for screening [T. Maniatis, E. F. Fritsch, J. Sambrook, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1982)]. Bluescript plasmids were rescued from plaque-purified clones by excision with M13 helper phage (Stratagene). The lung and pancreas libraries were purchased from Clontech Lab Inc. (Catalog Nos. HL1066b and HL1069h, respectively). The start point of the CF gene transcript was derived by primer extension procedures [F. J. Calzone, R. J. Britten, E. H. Davidson, Methods Enzymol. 152, 611 (1987)]. The oligonucleotide primer [positioned 157 nucleotides (nt) from the 5' end of the 10-1 clone] was end-labeled with [y-32P]ATP (Amersham, 5000 Ci/mmole) and T4 polynucleotide kinase, purified by gel filtration, and annealed with -5 pLg of T84 poly(A)+ RNA for 2 hours at 60°C. The extension reaction was performed at 41'C for 1 hour with avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase (Life Sciences, Inc.) and terminated by addition of NaOH to 0.4M and EDTA to 20 mM, with subsequent neutralization with ammonium acetate (pH 4.6). The products were treated with phenol, precipitated with ethanol, redissolved in buffer with formamide, and analyzed on a polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The anchored PCR procedure [M. A. Frohman, M. K. Dush, G. R. Martin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 8998 (1988)] was used to synthesize cDNA corresponding to the 5' and 3' ends of the transcript. For the 5' end clones, poly(A)+ RNA from pancreas and T84 cells were subjected to reverse-transcription with the use of an exon 2-specific primer (11). The first strand cDNA products were fractionated on an agarose column and the fractions containing large species were identified by gel electrophoresis after the polymerase chain reaction [R. K. Saiki et al., Science 230, 1350 (1985)] with a pair of oligonucleotide primers (145 nt apart within the 10- 1 sequence) just 5' of the extension primer. These products were pooled, concentrated, and treated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (BRL) and dATP, as recommended by the supplier. Second strand synthesis was performed with Taq Polymerase (Cetus, AmpliTaq) and an oligonucleotide containing a linker sequence, 5'-CGGAATTCTCGAGATC(T)12-3'. This linker, together with another primer (internal to the extension primer) with an Eco RI restriction site at its 5' end, was then used for PCR. After digestion with Eco RI and Bgl II, products were purified and cloned in Bluescript KS (Stratagene) by standard procedures. All the recovered clones contained inserts of more than 350 nt. The 3' end clones were generated with the use of similar procedures. PCR amplification was carried out with the linker described above and an oligonucleotide with the sequence 5'-ATGAAGTCCAAGGATITAG-3', which is -70 nt upstream ofthe Hind III site at position 5027 (Fig. 2). The products were digested with Hind III and Xho I and cloned in the Bluescript vector. Candidate clones were identified by hybridization with the 3' end of cDNA T16-4.5. All PCR's were performed for 30 cycles as described by the enzyme supplier. M. Kozak, Nucleic Acids Res. 12, 857 (1984); Cell 44, 283 (1986). Other sequence differences were noted between the normal (T16-4.5) and CF (Cl1/5) cDNA clones. At position 2629 (Fig. 2), T16-4.5 contained a C and Cl-1/5 a T, resulting in a change of Leu to Phe. At position 4555, the base was G in T16-4.5 but A in Cl-1/5 (Val to Met). The differences may be results of cDNA cloning artifacts or may represent sequence polymorphisms. Specific oligonucleotide hybridization analysis of patient or family DNA should distinguish these possibilities. Since these changes are conserved amino acid substitutions, they are unlikely to be causative mutations. Additional nucleotide differences were observed in the 3' untranslated region between different cDNA clones and the corresponding genomic DNA sequence. C. F. Higgins, M. P. Gallagher, M. L.

Several large families of integral membrane proteins are known, including: (i) A number of ligand-gated ion channels of which the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor [R. M. Stroud and J. Finer-Moore, Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1, 317 (1985)] is the prototype. Receptors for the inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA (33) and glycine are included in this family. (ii) A family of ion channels with a totally different structural motif are the voltage-gated, sodium, calcium, and potassium channels (27). (iii) Involved in the translocation of ions are the structurally related cation pumps such as the Ca2`-ATPase [C. J. Brandl, N. M. Green, B. Korczak, D. H. MacLennan, Cell 44, 597 (1986)], the Na+,K+-ATPase [G. E. Shull and J. B. Lingrel, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 4039 (1987)], and the H+,K+-ATPase [G. E. Shull and J. B. Lingrel, J. Biol.

"1","The adult form of Tay-Sachs disease, adult GM2 gangliosidosis, is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from mutations in the alpha chain of beta-hexosaminidase A. This disorder, like infantile Tay-Sachs disease, is more frequent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. A point mutation in the alpha-chain gene was identified that results in the substitution of Gly with Ser in eight Ashkenazi adult GM2 gangliosidosis patients from five different families. This amino acid substitution was shown to depress drastically the catalytic activity of the alpha chain after expression in COS-1 cells. All of these patients proved to be compound heterozygotes of the allele with the Gly to Ser change and one of the two Ashkenazi infantile Tay-Sachs alleles. These findings will aid in the diagnosis and understanding of beta-hexosaminidase A deficiency disorders.REFERENCES AND NOTES F. Craig, The Estivo-Autumnal Malarial Fevers (Wood, New York, 1901); S.

PRoIAt The adult form of Tay-Sachs disease, adult GM2 gangliosidosis, is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from mutations in the a chain of (3-hexosaminidase A. This disorder, like infantile Tay-Sachs disease, is more frequent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. A point mutation in the a-chain gene was identified that results in the substitution of Gly26' with Ser in eight Ashkenazi adult GM2 gangliosidosis patients from five different families. This amino acid substitution was shown to depress drastically the catalytic activity of the a chain after expression in COS-1 cells. All ofthese patients proved to be compound heterozygotes of the allele with the Gly to Ser change and one of the two Ashkenazi infantile Tay-Sachs alleles. These findings will aid in the diagnosis and understanding of ,B-hexosaminidase A deficiency disorders. BOOTH ADULT GM2 gangliosidosis and the infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease are autosomal recessive diseases caused by a deficiency of P-hexosaminidase A, a lysosomal enzyme composed of a and ,B chains (1). The enzyme deficiency is a consequence of mutations in the a-chain gene. As a result, there is a progressive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside, the natural substrate of P-hexosaminidase A, leading to degenerative changes in the nervous system. However, with respect to onset and severity, the two disorders are very different. In infantile Tay-Sachs disease, the age of onset is within the first year of life with death ensuing in early childhood after progressive motor and mental deterioration. In the adult disease (2, 3), onset usually occurs in the second or third decade with lower motor neuron, pyr-  amidal tract, and cerebellar deterioration. In many cases psychosis seems to be an integral part of the disease and precedes the other neurological manifestations (3). Both the adult and infantile diseases are more prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews than in the general population, with the infantile form predominating.  Recently it has been shown that two different mutations in the a-chain gene unGenetics and Biochemistry Branch, National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidnev Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892. *Present address: Human Genetics Department, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Tel-Aviv 69978, Israel, and Genetic Unit, Saphir Medical Center, Kfar-Saba 44281, Israel. tTo whom correspondence should be addressed: Building 10, Room 9D-15, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892.  REPORTS 14-71  Downloaded from www.sciencemag.org on December 8, 2014  surface ligand recognize an identical or closely related receptor binding site. Thrombospondin (TSP), an adhesive glycoprotein, has also been proposed as a receptor for cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes (18). Our purified CD36 was not contaminated with TSP, as determined by Coomassie blue and silver staining of protein separated by SDS-PAGE and by enzyme immunoassay with antiserum to TSP (17). In addition, TSP is synthesized by many cells that do not have the capacity to bind P. falciparum-infected cells (9). This lack of correlation between the presence of TSP and binding argues against the specificity of TSP as a cytoacherence receptor. Surface expression of a receptor recognized by MAb OKM5 is correlated with the ability of various monocyte and melanoma cell lines to bind infected erythrocytes (9, 10). Furthermore, much higher concentrations of TSP than of CD36 are required for significant inhibition of cytoadherence to C32 melanoma cells (200 ,ug/ml versus <10 ,ug/ml), and neither TSP nor antibodies to TSP have been reported to reverse cytoadherence. It is possible that CD36 and TSP have sequence similarities that account for the binding of infected erythrocytes to either of these purified proteins when immobilized on plastic. Altematively, CD36 and TSP may bind to independent ligands on the surface of K+-infected erythrocytes. Although these results strongly suggest that CD36 is a malaria sequestration receptor, the identity of the complementary ligand on the infected erythrocyte surface is still unknown. It has been suggested that the cytoadherence ligand is a poorly immunogenic conserved domain that is masked by a more immunogenic, strain-specific moiety on the surface of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes (19). The availability of purified CD36 should allow identification and characterization of epitopes on the cytoadherence ligand that may be useful for a malaria vaccine. Soluble CD36, or a fragment thereof that can reverse cytoadherence in vitro, may also be useful therapeutically for rapid reversal of sequestration in cerebral malaria or other complicated forms of this disease.  derlie Ashkenazi infantile Tay-Sachs disease: a splice junction mutation (4-6) at the 5' end of intron 12 accounts for -30% of the mutant alleles (4, 5) and a 4-base-pair insertion in exon 11 accounts for the remaining -70% (7). Both of the infantile Tay-Sachs mutations result in nearly undetectable levels of mRNA (6, 8-10), as well as a complete absence of a-chain protein (11) and of Ihexosaminidase A activity (1). In contrast, a-chain mRNA (12) and a precursor a-chain polypeptide are readily detectable in fibroblasts from adult patients (13, 14). Apparently this mutant a chain is able to form a small amount of active enzyme because these adult patients demonstrate a low level of activity if GM2 ganglioside is used as a Fig. 1. Nudeotide sequence of a-chain cDNA from a patient with GM2 ganglosidosis. An a-chain cDNA isolated from patient S.R. was subdoned into the Eco RI site of pUCl3. The normal a-chain cDNA has been described (9). The cDNAs were sequenced by the dideoxy-  substrate (15). No significant activity is detected with synthetic substrates (2). To identify the molecular defect in adult GM2 gangliosidosis, a cDNA library was constructed (16) with polyadenylated RNA prepared from the skin fibroblasts of a well studied 45-year-old Ashkenazi patient (S.R.) (17). This patient is an obligate carrier of an infantile Tay-Sachs allele, as one of his children was affected with this disorder. Since the Tay-Sachs infantile alleles give rise to little detectable mRNA, any cDNA clone isolated from this library was likely to be derived from the mRNA-positive adult GM2 gangliosidosis allele.

This analysis revealed that the cDNA was truncated at the 5' end and contained 1033 ofthe 1587 base pairs of the a-chain protein coding region (9). The only difference between the normal and the mutant cDNA sequence was a single nucleotide substitution, G to A, changing Gly269 (GGT) to Ser (AGT) (Fig. 1). The cDNA showed no evidence of either of the Ashkenazi infantile mutations. Since the nucleotide change in the cDNA occurs at the 3' nucleotide of exon 7 in the a-chain gene (18), we investigated the possibility that the mutation might extend into the intron. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (19), we amplified 190 base pairs of this patient's genomic DNA surrounding the G to A base change. A restriction fragment of the amplified DNA was cloned and sequenced. Two types of clones were found, one containing a normal sequence and the other with the same G to A change as in the cDNA with no alteration of the intron sequence (Fig. 2). The two sequences demonstrate, as was anticipated (17), that this patient is a heterozygote for the allele containing the G to A point mutaWe next developed an assay to screen for this point mutation in other adult patients. The 190-base-pair region surrounding the mutation was amplified from genomic DNA by the PCR technique, and the product was blotted onto a hybridization membrane. The samples were hybridized with allelespecific oligonucleotide probes to detect either the sequence containing the G to A change or the corresponding normal sequence. Amplified genomic DNA of eight Ashkenazi adult patients from five unrelated families were positive for the point mutation (Fig. 3). A normal Ashkenazi control and two Ashkenazi infantile Tay-Sachs carriers, each with a different mutation, were negative for the G to A change. To exclude the possibility that the G to A change is a neutral polymorphism, we screened genomic DNA from an additional ten normal Ashkenazi Jews and ten heterozygote carriers of one of the Ashkenazi infantile TaySachs alleles. None of these DNA samples were positive for the G to A mutation. Both patients and controls were positive with the probe carrying the normal sequence (Fig. 3) and could not be distinguished at any of the washing temperatures tested, consistent with compound heterozygosity in all of the patients. We determined if the presumed compound heterozygosity was a result of the allele bearing the G to A change in combination with either of the infantile Tay-Sachs alleles.

The amplified DNA samples were blotted on a filter and hybridized to allele-specific oligonucleotide probes under conditions that detect the infantile mutations (4, 7). The autoradiograms (Fig. 3) clearly indicate that each adult patient carries an Ashkenazi infantile Tay-Sachs mutant allele; two patients carry the splice junction mutation in intron 12 and the remaining six carry the more common insertion in exon 11. These results demonstrate that all the patients are compound heterozygotes with one allele containing the G to A change in exon 7 and the other harboring one of the two Ashkenazi infantile Tay-Sachs mutations. We studied the segregation of the alleles bearing the G to A mutation and the infantile insertion mutation in three generations of the family of the two related patients, R.O. and A.O. (Fig. 4, III-1 and III-2). The allele bearing the G to A mutation was inherited from the patients' father (II-1) and is also carried by their grandmother (I-1) (Fig. 4). The infantile Tay-Sachs allele segregated from the maternal side; the patients' mother (II-2), aunt (II-3), and cousin (III4) harbor this insertion defect. The unaffected sibling (III-3) carries the adult but not the infantile mutation. We investigated the consequence of the G to A point mutation on the catalytic activity associated with the at chain. The G to A change was introduced into the normal atchain cDNA by oligonucleotide mediated site-directed mutagenesis (20). The normal and the mutated ax-chain cDNAs were inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector, pSVL, and the plasmid DNAs were transfected into COS-1 cells (21). The cell extracts were assayed with a synthetic substrate (22) specific for the catalytic activity of the a chain (23). Transfection with the normal at chain (pSVLa) resulted in a large increase of catalytic activity. Most of this activity is likely to represent 3-hexosaminidase S (aaot) I7 MARCH I989  because greater than 90% of the activity was not precipitable with antibodies reactive with the 3 chain. In contrast to the normal cDNA, no increase over background activity was observed with the cDNA containing the G to A change (pSVLoa Gly269 -* Ser) (Table 1). The cells transfected with the mutant cDNA were found, however, to synthesize an a-chain polypeptide (12). We have shown that all adult Tay-Sachs patients tested thus far carry a mutated achain allele with a Gly269 to Ser change. In all of the patients, the allele bearing this point mutation was found in combination with one ofthe two Ashkenazi infantile TaySachs alleles. Although the frequency of the adult mutation is not yet established, it is thought to be rare (24). Thus, the appearance of the adult disorder in Ashkenazi Jews is, in large part, due to the high carrier frequency (1/30) of the infantile Tay-Sachs alleles. The Gly269 to Ser change is functionally significant because it eliminated the catalytic activity associated with the a chain. A previous study had demonstrated that the a chain expressed in fibroblasts from adult GM2 gangliosidosis patients is defective in subFig. 3. The ax-chain mutations in Ashkenazi adult GM2gangliosidosis patients. Genomic DNA (indicated at the top of the figure) was isolated from the blood samples of a normal Ashkenazi individual (normal control), and from two infantile TaySachs carriers; one harboring the splice Junction mutation (SPL) and the other carrying the 4base-pair insertion mutation (INS). The other DNAs were from adult GM2 gangliosidosis pa-  unit assembly (14). Thus, the lack of activity after expression in COS-1 cells may be the inability of the a chain with the Gly269 to Ser change to dimerize and form catalytically active P-hexosaminidase S (aao) (1). The importance of this Gly at position 269 is also suggested by its conservation in both the homologous human 1 chain (10, 25) and in 1-hexosaminidase from the slime mold Dictyostylium discoideum (26). Although the cDNA that we isolated appeared to be derived from a correctly spliced mRNA, it is possible that the G to A mutation, because of its position at the 3' end of exon 7, might disrupt the splicing of a fraction of the a-chain mRNA. The Spfash mutation in the mouse ornithine transcarbamylase gene, also a G to A change occurring in the last nucleotide of an exon, has been shown to result in some misspliced mRNA (27). The identification of the mutation in adult GM2 gangliosidosis, together with the two previously identified infantile Tay-Sachs mutations, will facilitate the study and diagnosis of 3-hexosaminidase deficiencies in the Ashkenazi population.

The regions surrounding the G to A point mutation (described in Fig. 2) and each of the two infantile Tay-Sachs mutations (4, 7) were amplified by the PCR technique. The amplified DNA was blotted on Gene Screen Plus filters (Du Pont, Biotechnology Systems), denatured, neutralized, and dried. Prehybridization was for 1 hour at 37°C in a solution containing IM NaCI, 0.005M EDTA, 1% SDS, and denatured salmon sperm DNA (100 ,ug/ml). Hybridization was performed overnight at 37°C after addition of the appropriate 32P-labeled allele-specific oligonucleotide probe (-2.5 ng/ml). The oligonucleotide probes, indicated on the left of the figure, were as follows: Gly269, 5'-TGGGGACCAGGTAAGAATG-3', corresponding to the normal sequence in the region of the G to A change; Ser269, 5'-TGGGGACCAAGTAAGAATG-3', corresponding to the mutant sequence containing the G to A change; SPL, 5'-CAGGCTCTGTGCTAAGGGTT-3', corresponding to the splice junction mutation found in infantile Tay-Sachs disease (4); and INS, 5'-GAACCGTATATCTATCCTA-3', corresponding to the 4-base-pair insertion found in infantile Tay-Sachs disease (7). The blots were washed twice for 30 min in 2 x saline sodium citrate (SSC) containing 0.5% SDS at room temperature and then for 5 min at 55°C with 2 x SSC.  Fig. 4.

Diagnosis based on these mutations will be helpful for carrier detection and genetic counseling when the enzymatic assay is inconclusive. Furthermore, it is now possible, with allele-specific probes, to distinguish carriers of the adult mutation from carriers of the infantile mutations, which is not achievable with the conventional enzymatic assay. Finally, it will be of interest to determine if the mutation described here is present in the various clinical forms (juvenile, chronic, and adult) associated with P-hexosaminidase A deficiency in Ashkenazi Jews and in other ethnic groups (28) and to assess the clinical consequences of this mutation in a homozygous form.

The rapid application of the selective glutamate agonist, quisqualate, activates a large rapidly inactivating current (3 to 8 milliseconds), which is mediated by a neuronal ionic channel with high unitary conductance (35 picosiemens). The current through this channel shows pharmacologic characteristics similar to those observed for the fast excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC); it reverses near 0 millivolts and shows no significant voltage dependence. The amplitude of the current through this channel is many times larger than that through the other non-NMDA (Nmethyl-D-aspartate) channels. These results suggest that this high-conductance quisqualate-activated channel may mediate the fast EPSC in the mammalian central nervous system.

The glutamate-evoked current is the result of the behavior of more than one type of glutamate channel coexisting on the same neuron (2, 3).

Havel, October 17, 1988  Familial defective apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 ABSTRACT is a genetic disease that leads to hypercholesterolemia and to an increased serum concentration of low density lipoproteins that bind defectively to the apoB,E(LDL) receptor. The disorder appears to result from a mutation in the gene for apoB-100. Extensive sequence analysis of the two alleles of one subject heterozygous for the disorder has revealed a previously unreported mutation in the codon for amino acid 3500 that results in the substitution of glutamine for arginine. This same mutant allele occurs in six other, unrelated subjects and in eight affected relatives in two of these families. A partial haplotype of this mutant apoB-100 allele was constructed by sequence analysis and restriction enzyme digestion at positions where variations in the apoB-100 are known to occur. This haplotype is the same in three probands and four affected members of one family and lacks a polymorphic Xba I site whose presence has been correlated with high cholesterol levels. Thus, it appears that the mutation in the codon for amino acid 3500 (CGG -+ CAG), a CG mutational "hot spot," defmes a minor apoB-100 allele associated with defective low density lipoproteins and hypercholesterolemia.  receptor on fibroblasts in an in vitro assay (3). Studies of the kindred of this patient indicated that the proband and affected family members are heterozygotes and that the defect is transmitted in a co-dominant fashion. This pattern of inheritance is consistent with the fact that each LDL particle contains but one apoB-100 molecule (4). Thus, affected individuals contain two LDL populations, one with defective receptor binding capacity and the other with normal properties. The present study concerns the molecular basis of this disease, termed familial defective apoB-100 (3). The DNA of the mutant allele contains a mutation that segregates with the defective binding and the moderate cholesterolemia in the kindred referred to above. The genomes of six unrelated subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia contain the same mutation in the apoB gene. The relationship of this mutation to other genetic markers that have been used to trace defective apoB alleles in the population is discussed.  The level of cholesterol in human plasma is to a large extent controlled by the interaction of low density lipoproteins (LDLs) with apoB,E(LDL) (or LDL) receptors. LDLs transport about two-thirds of the plasma cholesterol and are removed from the circulation by the apoB,E(LDL) receptor as a result of binding to apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100), the protein moiety of LDL. Individuals with high LDL levels are often predisposed to premature coronary disease. In principle, elevated LDL concentrations that result from inefficient clearance of LDL particles by the receptor may derive either from defects in the receptor or from defects in the ligand, apoB-100. The former class of genetic disorder is well established: familial hypercholesterolemia (1). Individuals with this genetic disease may lack the apoB,E(LDL) receptor or possess defective variants of it. However, because this genetic defect is relatively rare and most hypercholesterolemic individuals possess apoB,E(LDL) receptors that lack detectable defects, attention has been focused on other possible causes of increased LDL levels. One possibility is the presence of a mutant form of apoB-100. A group of moderately hypercholesterolemic patients has been shown (2) to have a reduced fractional clearance rate of autologous LDL as compared with normal LDL. This finding suggested that the retarded clearance resulted from a defective binding of LDL to its receptor, thereby accounting for the high levels of LDL cholesterol. LDLs from one of these patients exhibited defective binding to the apoB,E(LDL)  Patient Material. Plasma and leukocytes were obtained from individuals of three families. The proband of the R. family, G.R., had been shown to have a reduced clearance of autologous LDL compared with homozygous normal LDL (2). Of eight R. family members tested, four have LDLs that bind abnormally to the apoB,E(LDL) receptor in normal human fibroblasts (3). Two other patients (W.S. and R.N.) were identified as probands of the S. and N. families, respectively. These patients were found to have delayed in vivo clearance of autologous LDL from plasma (5). Likewise, W.S. and 4 of 15 family members tested have LDLs that exhibit abnormal binding to normal human fibroblast apoB,E(LDL) receptors. R.N. (who was recruited into the study by Margo Denke, Dallas, TX) also possesses LDLs that have abnormal receptor binding. Techniques to define abnormal binding of LDL to receptors in normal human fibroblasts have been presented in detail elsewhere (3). DNA was prepared by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Genomic Libraries. Two libraries were prepared from G.R. DNA in phage A. The first contained DNA partially digested with Mbo I and ligated to arms of A FIX (Stratagene) (4 X 106 recombinants with inserts of between 9 and 22 kilobases).

To identify a mutation that could be responsible for a defect in the ability of LDL to bind to its receptor, we examined the part of the gene corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal half of apoB100. Lipoproteins containing apoB-48, the amino-terminal half of apo-B100, do not bind to the apoB,E(LDL) receptor (8); also, the epitopes of antibodies that block LDL binding to the receptor are localized to the carboxyl-terminal onethird of the protein in a region encoded by the large 7572-bp exon 26 (9). Since G.R. is heterozygous for the defect, only substitutions occurring in one but not both of the patient's two apoB alleles can be causally related to defective LDL. Fig. 1 illustrates the positions at which differences in the apoB-100 sequence have been reported. This information was assembled from known DNA polymorphisms (10, 11) together with four complete cDNA sequences (12-15), a gene sequence (10), and several partial sequences (16, 17). All reported variations are included, even though some may have resulted from cloning or sequencing errors. Codons and amino acids reported in the majority of the publications are termed "consensus" in Fig. 1, even though the appropriateness of this designation could be contested. Likewise, codons and amino acid residues depicted in the lower half of the figure are referred to as variants only because they have been reported less often. These two sequences do not represent established haplotypes, and their relative frequencies in the population have not been ascertained (10). Two libraries of G.R. DNA were constructed in A vectors. ApoB-containing clones covering the regions illustrated in Fig. 1 were isolated. Several of the 13 subclones were screened for differences by DNA sequencing. After extensive sequencing of multiple isolates, only one change was detected. This alteration reflected a CGG -- CAG change in the codon for amino acid 3500, causing a substitution of glutamine for arginine (Fig. 2). To the best of our knowledge, this variant has not been reported. No other previously unreported nucleotide changes were observed. Furthermore, none of the variant positions illustrated in Fig. 1 were shown to be heterozygous in G.R. DNA except position 7673, the Xba I site, which is a third-position substitution that does not change the amino acid. An extensive sequence analysis of the mutant allele yielded the results that are summarized in Fig.  The libraries were screened with various human apoB cDNA probes. DNA Sequencing. DNA from A clones was subcloned into M13 vectors and sequenced by the Sanger dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method (6). Oligonucleotides. All oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems synthesizer model 380B. Those used as primers for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or as allele-specific oligonucleotide probes (ASOs) are listed in Table 1. Probes were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [32P]ATP to 106 cpm/ng. PCR. The PCR was used for local amplification of sections of the human apoB gene. Reactions were conducted in an automated Perkin-Elmer/Cetus thermal cycler by using thermostable Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase obtained from Cetus (7). Xba I Polymorphism. The presence or absence of the Xba I site at position 7673 was determined by amplifying a segment of exon 26 from position 7591 to position 7809 by using primers PCR1 and PCR2. Complete digestion of the amplified band with Xba I yielded two fragments, of 136 and 82 base pairs (bp). Msp I Polymorphism. The presence or absence of the Msp I site at position 11,039 was determined by amplifying a 480-bp segment of exon 26 from position 10,644 to position 11,124 by using primers PCR4 and PCR6. Complete digestion of the amplified band with Msp I yielded two fragments, of 395 and 85 bp. Plasmids. Plasmid p46a, containing an EcoRI-EcoRI 1549bp fragment from exon 26 subcloned from the G.R.

Four other individuals with defective LDLs, who were unrelated to any of the aforementioned, were also heterozygous for the mutation. Haplotype of the Mutant Allele. We wished to establish a partial haplotype of the mutant allele, in part to determine the extent to which other markers (e.g., the Xba I polymorphism at position 7673) correlate with this allele. This question was of interest because earlier studies established that the X2 allele(i.e., the allele containing the Xba I site) is associated with higher levels of plasma cholesterol (18, 19). For this purpose, we determined the genotype of each member of the R. kindred and of two other hypercholesterolemic patients at the Xba I site (the 5' side of the Arg -- Gln change) and the Msp I site (the 3' side). For both RFLPs the genotype was determined by digesting amplified DNA representing these two regions with Xba I and Msp I. The results are summarized in Fig. 4. With respect to the Xba I genotype, it is clear that the mutant allele must be X1. For example, the proband and his two brothers are X1/X2, and the affected granddaughter is X1/X1, but the unaffected son of G.R. is X2/X2. The genotypes of the unrelated patients R.N. and W.S. are consistent with this view, as is the fact that the G.R. mutant allele has the codon ACC for amino acid 2488 (i.e., X1). In contrast, the normal allele of G.R. is X2. Although the Msp I polymorphism proved to be less informative, the data are  2 in terms of the variant positions of Fig. 1. Sequencing of the other G.R. allele has been less extensive, but the sequences established at several of the variant positions conform to published sequences. The sequence of the codon for amino acid 3292, deduced by annealing an amplified region encompassed by PCR3 and PCR5 with oligonucleotides ASO1 and ASO2, proved to encode aspartic acid in both alleles. Inheritance of the Arginine/Glutamine Polymorphism. To test whether the CGG -- CAG mutation in the codon for amino acid 3500 segregated with defective LDLs, a family study was undertaken. A region of the apoB gene of the R. and S. kindreds encompassing the mutation was amplified, and the amplified DNA was screened with ASOs. To this end, a pair of 15-mer oligonucleotides representing the mutant and normal alleles were synthesized: ASO3 and ASO4 (see Table 1). A third oligonucleotide probe (ASO5) within the amplified region was used, representing a region whose sequence was identical in both G.R. alleles. These three oligonucleotides were used to probe the amplified DNAs in a slot blot (Fig. 3). Two plasmid DNAs were included to evaluate the discrimination afforded by the two allele-specific probes. The results demonstrate that the mutation segregates in members of both families with defective LDLs and moderate hypercholesterolemia. Only affected family members carry the mutant allele.

DISCUSSION A high degree of genetic polymorphism in human LDL has been recognized since 1976, when it was established that allotypic antibodies in the serum of multiply transfused patients are capable of distinguishing allelic variants of LDL (20). These allotypic variants have been shown to be closely linked to DNA polymorphisms in the apoB gene (21). Furthermore, comparison of five complete and several partial published human apoB gene sequences revealed more than 60 nucleotide substitutions, the majority of which affect the amino acid sequence of the protein (10). Our intention in the present study was to determine whether any of these polymorphisms correlated with familial defective apoB-100. As a result of many previous studies, two correlations between apoB polymorphisms and abnormalities in lipoprotein metabolism have been established. Serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels are higher in individuals with the Ag(x-) epitope than in individuals with the Ag(x') epitope (22). Furthermore, theXba I RFLP, which is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the Ag(x) epitope, is also correlated with serum cholesterol levels. Homozygotes with alleles that lack the Xba I site (i.e., X1/X1) tend to have lower serum cholesterol levels than X2/X2 homozygotes or X1/X2 heterozygotes (18, 19). This effect seems to be attributable to a difference in the level of LDL and apoB (23). Other authors have noted an association between the Xba I polymorphism and myocardial infarction (24). Other RFLPs in the apoB gene fail to correlate with abnormalities in lipid metabolism (19). The mutation reported here changes the codon for amino acid 3500 and correlates with hypercholesterolemia and with  defective LDL binding to the receptor. All three familial defective apoB-100 probands described here and all affected members in two kindreds have this same mutation. Our most recent data define a total of seven unrelated probands heterozygous for this mutation, all of whom have defective LDLs. Furthermore, all of their relatives shown to carry the mutant allele also have LDLs that are defective in binding to the receptor (data not shown). We have failed to detect any other differences between the two alleles of the original proband G.R., except for the fact that he is heterozygous for the Xba I polymorphism at nucleotide 7673 that changes the third position of a threonine codon. However, we have not yet determined the complete sequence of this mutant apoB allele. Therefore, the argument that the substitution of glutamine for arginine at amino acid 3500 is responsible for the defective binding of LDL to the receptor remains circumstantial. Attempts to express full-length apoB gene constructs in cultured cells that differ only in this codon are a logical test of this proposition. The mutation in the codon for amino acid 3500, CGG CAG, is an example of a potential mutational "hot spot." Mutations at CG dinucleotides in higher animals are unusually frequent (25, 26) as a result of methylation of cytosine on the 5' side of guanine and spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine (27). In the present case the mutation is attributable to a C T transition in the noncoding strand. Such mutational hot spots have been reported in the human gene for factor VIII (28). It has been estimated that the extent of hypermutability at CG dinucleotides in the factor VIII gene is 10- to 20-fold greater than the rate at other positions (29). That CG dinucleotides in general are potential mutational hot spots is suggested by the unusually high frequency of polymorphism at a number of loci in human DNA where CG occurs in the recognition site for certain restriction enzymes such as Msp I and Taq I (29). In the case of the human apoB gene, two other polymorphisms have -*  Genetics: Soria et al. been reported (11, 30) that result from mutations at CG dinucleotides, both at Msp I sites. Again by analogy to the factor VIII gene (28), these three CG dinucleotides may be hot spots where recurrent mutations have taken place in the human population. The amino acid substitution at position 3500 occurs in a region implicated in LDL binding to the apoB,E(LDL) receptor. Although the receptor binding domain of apoB-100 has yet to be precisely defined, several lines of evidence point to this region of the protein encoded by exon 26. Two sequences in this region encode stretches of basic amino acids beginning at positions 3147 and 3359, the second of which displays some similarity to the receptor binding domain of apoE (14). Furthermore, the epitopes of several antibodies that inhibit LDL binding to its receptor also map to this region (31). Of particular relevance is the fact that one of these monoclonal antibodies, MB47, can distinguish mutant from normal LDL in terms of affinity (5). The epitope of this antibody has been localized between residues 3350 and 3506 (12). Thus, the difference in affinity is presumably attributable to the substitution of glutamine for arginine. The fact that this antibody can recognize a change on the surface of LDL and also inhibit receptor binding is consistent with a role for arginine-3500 in receptor binding. This amino acid is located within a cluster of basic residues in apoB-100, although its sequence does not resemble that of the receptor binding domain of apoE. In addition to establishing the presence of the mutation in the codon for arginine-3500 in hypercholesterolemic subjects and their relatives, the haplotype of the mutant allele must be defined. This is important because the human apoB gene is so polymorphic: at least 14 haplotypes exist at different frequencies in various populations (32). At present, our information is limited to the region of exon 26 corresponding to amino acids 2488-3611 [i.e., between the polymorphic Xba I site (18, 19) and a polymorphic Msp I site (11)]. Of particular interest is the fact  that the mutant alleles of all three probands examined contain the X1 variant of the Xba I polymorphism. Thus, although the association between the mutation at position 3500 and the Xba I polymorphism has yet to be studied in a large number of subjects, it would appear unlikely that previous studies reporting association between the X2 genotype and high cholesterol levels simply reflect the mutation discussed here. On the contrary, the mutation at position 3500 appears to define a minor X1 allele that segregates with defective LDL and moderate  hypercholesterolemia.

The disorder appears to result from a mutation in the gene for apoB-100. Extensive sequence analysis of the two alleles of one subject heterozygous for the disorder has revealed a previously unreported mutation in the codon for amino acid 3500 that results in the substitution of glutamine for arginine. This same mutant allele occurs in six other, unrelated subjects and in eight affected relatives in two of these families. A partial haplotype of this mutant apoB-100 allele was constructed by sequence analysis and restriction enzyme digestion at positions where variations in the apoB-100 are known to occur. This haplotype is the same in three probands and four affected members of one family and lacks a polymorphic Xba I site whose presence has been correlated with high cholesterol levels. Thus, it appears that the mutation in the codon for amino acid 3500 (CGG----CAG), a CG mutational "hot spot," defines a minor apoB-100 allele associated with defective low density lipoproteins and hypercholesterolemia.Association between a specific apolipoprotein B mutation and familial defective apolipoprotein B-100."

SUMMARY Ten useful two allele restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene were used for haplotype analysis in 45 unrelated familial hypercholesterolaemic (FH) patients, 60 normal controls, and 32 FH homozygotes, all of whom were white Afrikaners. Pedigree analysis in 27 informative heterozygous FH and 23 normal families has shown the segregation of at least 17 haplotypes in the normal population (111 chromosomes) compared to a predominant association of two of these haplotypes with the disease in the FH subjects. This association was further confirmed in 32 FH homozygotes, indicating at least two 'founder' members for the disease in the Afrikaner population. Recombination events were not detected in any of the families studied and we thus conclude that the haplotypes associated with FH function as specific markers for the disease and will allow presymptomatic diagnosis in affected families.  The prevalence of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), an autosomal dominant disease characterised by raised low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, is five to 10 times higher in the Afrikaner population than has been reported for most other population groups in the world.1 2 Seftel et al1 have suggested a 'founder gene effect' to explain this abnormally high frequency. Clinical studies have indicated that tendon xanthomas and premature coronary artery disease (CAD) are encountered in middle aged FH heterozygotes, while in the homozygous condition both cutaneous and tendon xanthomas as well as aortic and coronary atherosclerosis generally appear before the age of 10 years.3 Over recent years it has been shown by Brown and Goldstein4 that FH is caused by mutations in the LDL receptor gene. The availability of cDNA and genomic clones of this gene have now made it possible to characterise mutations at the DNA level.4 5 We have previously provided evidence for the existence of at least two 'founder' FH genes in Received for publication 26 September 1988. Accepted for publication 4 October 1988.  255  the Afrikaner population.6 Four haplotypes defined by the restriction enzymes PvuII (P), Stul (S), and NcoI (N) were found to segregate in this population. In 71% of FH families studied, the defective gene cosegregated with the rare allele of a NcoI RFLP7 (P1S1N2 haplotype), while the rare allele of a StuI RFLP8 (P2S2N1 haplotype) segregated with FH in 20% of these families. We now report on haplotype associations of 10 different DNA polymorphisms at the LDL receptor gene locus in the normocholesterolaemic and FH populations and in a large number of FH homozygotes.  Subjects and methods  The FH heterozygous patients and normocholesterolaemic subjects were those previously described.6 Pedigree analyses were performed on 27 of the 45 heterozygous FH patients and 29 of the 60 normal subjects. Blood samples were collected from 292 of the FH family members and 130 of the members from normal families. Thirty-two patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia from 27  M J Kotze, E Langenhoven, A E Retief, H C Seftel, H E Henderson, and H FH Weich  256  white Afrikaner families, attending lipid clinics at the Tygerberg, Johannesburg, Groote Schuur, and Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospitals, South Africa, donated blood samples for DNA  analysis. The homozygous state of FH was diagnosed on the basis of the following criteria': (1) plasma cholesterol concentrations greater than 15 mmol/Il; (2) the appearance of xanthomas in the first decade of life; and (3) hypercholesterolaemia or early CAD in the parents of the proband. Methods used in determination of lipoproteins, preparation of DNA, restriction endonuclease digestion, transfer to nitrocellulose, and prehybridisation to nick translated DNA probes have been described elsewhere.6 Filters were washed as described with a final wash in lxSSC (0.15 mol/l NaCl, 0*015 mol/I Na citrate) at 65°C. Three human DNA probes for the LDL receptor gene were used in this study. Probe 1, pLDLR-2HH1, consists of a 1*9 kb fragment of the 3' end of the LDL receptor cDNA clone9 and was obtained from D W Russell of Dallas. Probe 2 was a 1-05 kb PstI fragment  subcloned from pLDLR-3, a full length LDL receptor cDNA; pLDLR-3 was obtained from the American type culture collection (ATCC). Probe 3 was a 3-8 kb ApaI fragment of pLDLR-3.

All variants showed autosomal codominant inheritance and the distribution of homozygotes and heterozygotes at each site was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibria determined from the individual allele frequencies. We previously reported a statistically significant excess of the rare allele of the NcoI RFLP in our FH population (X2=17 2 1 df, p<0-005). An increase has also been found in the rare allele of the ApaLl (3') RFLP (X2=59-1, p<0-005), and common alleles of the AvaIl (X2=6-7 p<0-01), ApaLI (5') (X2= 14.6, p<0005), PstI (X2=10X4, p<0005), and TaqI (X2=4-2 p<005) RFLPs in FH patients compared to normocholesterolaemic controls. This indicates population association of these alleles with the gene predisposing to hypercholesterolaemia.  TABLE 2 Frequency of DNA RFLPs at the LDL receptor gene locus.

The frequencies of the common and rare alleles of the TaqI RFLP reported for the Japanese10 differ significantly from those observed in our population (X2=33*7, p<0005) (table 2). Differences were also found with alleles defined by the AvaIIl3 (6 =6.5, p<0025), PvuII'5 (X2=4.3, p<0-05), MspI (X2=6-0 p<0025), and ApaLI (3 )14 (X2=19-7, p<0-005) RFLPs reported for Caucasians.  *See text.  By assigning a '1' for the presence of a common RFLP allele and a '2' for the rare allele, haplotype arrangements for all 10 polymorphic sites taken as a unit have been determined in 111 normal chromosomes. Haplotype status was assigned by family studies (73 chromosomes) or by homozygosity for at least nine of the 10 RFLPs (38 chromosomes). Haplotypes not associated with the disease in FH subjects and families were also counted as normal. Pedigree information was not available for 10 FH subjects and 22 normal subjects heterozygous for two or more of the RFLPs and were therefore omitted from this analysis. We observed marked linkage disequilibrium between the 10 polymorphic sites at the LDL receptor gene locus. Since each of these sites distinguishes two alleles, there are 1024 (210) possible haplotypic arrangements.

Four separate haplotypes (1, 3, 4, and 13) were found in association with the FH phenotype in the remaining four informative families (3%). The haplotypes determined for 32 FH homozygotes (from 27 kindreds) are shown in table 5. Twenty-nine of these subjects, representing 24 separate kindreds, were homozygous for haplotype 2, while subjects 8, 383, and 884 (table 1) showed compound heterozygosity for haplotypes 2 and 6. These results establish a clear predominance in the FH population studied of the two haplotypes among the 17 observed in the normal South African population. Discussion A total of 10 useful two allele probe-enzyme systems, spanning a distance of 45 kb, were used for RFLP haplotype studies at the LDL receptor gene locus. We have shown marked linkage disequilibrium between these 10 markers, since only 17 haplotypes among 1024 possible haplotypic combinations were observed in 111 chromosomes from the normal South African population. This finding is in keeping with other RFLP studies at the immunoglobulin (200 kb) and , globin (60 kb)18 loci where linkage disequilibrium was also shown over relatively short genetic distances. The major reason for this phenomenon is the close proximity of the polymorphic sites and the resulting low frequency of their separation through recombination events. This was evident in our study of several two and three  generation families where no recombinants were detected. We have found significant differences in the frequency of five of the 10 RFLPs at the LDL receptor locus in South African Afrikaners compared with populations in other countries. This most probably also indicates differing haplotype frequencies. Discrepancies in the number and frequency of haplotypes between populations have been ascribed to selective advantage for certain alleles, or genetic drift associated with the effects of migration. Founder effects also play a role and probably underly the distinguishing RFLP frequencies in our Afrikaner population. A founder effect is well documented in this group which has remained isolated through religious belief and cultural bonds. Pedigree analyses in normal and FH families have shown the presence of a small number of haplotypes in normal chromosomes. Only two of these haplotypes are associated with FH in the homozygous FH patients and we thus conclude that the defective LDL receptor genes associated with these haplotypes (2 and 6) account for the founder effect in the Afrikaner and probably represent two separate gene defects. Only four of the FH families studied (11%) have shown association with other haplotypes (1, 3, 4, and 13), which probably correspond to the 10 times lower FH frequency found in other population groups. The nature of the alteration in the DNA structure of the LDL receptor genes underlying FH in the Afrikaner population has not yet been reported. Our results clearly indicate that haplotypes function as specific markers for FH in affected families. Early detection of carriers is thus possible, allowing for dietary and life style modification to reduce the subsequent risk of early heart disease.

Nonhereditary retinoblastoma is caused by a somatic mutation. Hereditary retinoblastoma is caused by a germ-cell mutation, most often a new one, and thus there is usually no family history of the disease. Unlike patients with the nonhereditary disease, those with the hereditary form are at risk for additional retinoblastomas, and their progeny are at risk for the tumors. We used a sensitive technique of primer-directed enzymatic amplification, followed by DNA sequence analysis, to identify mutations as small as a single nucleotide change in tumors from seven patients with simplex retinoblastoma (with no family history of the disease). In four patients the mutation involved only the tumor cells, and in three it involved normal somatic cells as well as tumor cells but was not found in either parent; thus, these mutations appeared to be new, germ-cell mutations. In addition, we found point mutations in cells from a bladder carcinoma, a small-cell carcinoma of the lung, and another retinoblastoma. We conclude that the technique that we have described can distinguish hereditary from nonhereditary retinoblastoma and that it is useful in risk estimation and genetic counseling."

However, the study of natural mutations allows correlations not only between structure and function but also between structure and phenotype. For example, the molecular nature of a mutation in the AR gene has been recently reported in a family found to have a deletion of the entire steroid-binding domain (26) associated with loss of androgen-binding activity and complete AIS. Identification of natural gene deletions and point mutations offers an opportunity to study structural alterations in AR that affect sex differentiation, development, and reproductive function. In this study, our aims were to determine the location of the hAR gene splice sites for comparison with other steroid receptors and to obtain the intron sequences flanking each exon to enable us to design oligonucleotide primers for exon DNA amplification by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (27). Amplification of exons made it possible to sequence the AR gene- coding regions of affected individuals in a family with complete AIS (28, 29) and revealed a single point mutation within the steroid-binding domain.  Androgens act through a receptor protein to promote differentiation and development of the male phenotype (1, 2). The androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the steroid receptor family, which is part of a larger nuclear receptor superfamily (3-5). These receptor proteins are related by sequence similarities within their "zinc finger" DNA-binding domains and by ligand-dependent regulation of specific gene transcription (3-5). Complementary DNAs of many members of the nuclear receptor family have been cloned (refs. 3-5 and references therein and ref. 6), including the human receptors for thyroid hormone, retinoic acid, vitamin D, glucocorticoid, progesterone, mineralocorticoid, estrogen, and androgen (713). Genomic clones have been described for the human estrogen (14), human vitamin D (15), chicken thyroid hormone (16), and chicken progesterone (17) receptors. To further understand the evolution and function of steroid receptors in eukaryotes and to identify mutations in the human AR (hAR) gene that cause the androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), we undertook to clone the AR gene.** In 46,XY individuals, X chromosome-linked androgen insensitivity results in a spectrum of developmental abnormalities ranging from a complete external female phenotype to partially masculinized ambiguous genitalia (1, 2, 18-21) and may include some infertile males with apparently normal genitalia but defective spermatogenesis (22). Mutations produced in vitro have allowed structure-function analyses of nuclear receptors by examining effects of these mutations in  MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation and Analysis of hAR Genomic Clones. Exon specific oligonucleotide probes were located within the AR cDNA by comparison of the hAR amino acid sequence (10) with the gene structure and amino acid sequence of the chicken progesterone receptor (cPR) (17). These exon specific oligonucleotides and hAR cDNA fragments were used as probes to identify four genomic clones from a partial Sau3A, bacteriophage A Charon 35, flow-sorted, X chromosome genomic library (XLAOXNLO1, obtainable from the American Type Culture Collection). Exons C-H, contained within the clones, were isolated, subcloned, and sequenced as described for the isolation of exons A and B (7, 10). Exon sequences of hAR were compared with exons of other steroid receptors by the GCG alignment program (30). Experimental Subjects. Informed written consent was obtained from each individual according to The Johns Hopkins Institutional Guidelines for Clinical Investigation. The three affected 46,XY siblings with complete AIS and their mother have been described (28, 29, 31, 32). The affected siblings had normal female external genitalia with absence of uterus and fallopian tubes. A short vagina ended in a blind pouch.

Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase) (3.75 units) (Cetus) and each oligonucleotide at 20 AM were used per reaction. Amplification conditions consisted of an initial denaturing step at 950C for 5 min, annealing at 600C for 1 min, and polymerization at 720C for 6 min, followed by 30 cycles of 950C for 30 sec, 60'C for 1 min, and 720C for 6 min with a 3-sec increment per cycle in polymerization time. For oligonucleotide pairs A7-A8 and A9-A10, an annealing temperature of 650C reduced the number of nonspecific fragments. In addition, 60 cycles were used for oligonucleotide pair A7-A8, which amplifies a fragment with high G+C content. Amplified fragments of the correct size were ligated into blunt end M13 vectors and sequenced (7, 10). Errors due to Taq polymerase misincorporation were detected by sequencing two independent clones of each orientation.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Six genomic clones containing exons of the amino acid coding regions of the hAR gene were isolated from a human X chromosome A library by using hAR cDNA and synthetic oligonucleotide probes. Although the genomic clone inserts averaged 15 kilobases (kb) and the mRNA of hAR was 10-11 kb (7, 9, 10), only exons D and E and exons F, G, and H were found in the same clones (data not shown). Calculations based on five nonoverlapping clones averaging 15 kb yielded a size estimate of >75 kb for the hAR gene. Sequences of the hAR coding exons and flanking intron regions are shown in Fig. 1. Cloned genomic exon and flanking intron sequences were confirmed by sequencing PCR amplified fragments of genomic DNA. Development of a method utilizing PCR for rapid analysis of mutations in the coding regions of the AR gene required that we sequence only far enough into the flanking introns to allow selection of suitable synthetic oligonucleotide primers to bracket each exon. Thus, the large central regions of each intron remain to be sequenced. Exons  hAR  With the determination of the intron/exon splice junction sequences, both evolutionary and functional analyses of the hAR and its mutations are now possible. The intron/exon boundaries have the canonical splice consensus sequences (double underlined in Fig. 1) (33). Splice sites of the hAR gene and those of human estrogen receptor (hER) (14) and cPR (17) genes are remarkably similar in location and flanking amino acid sequences (data not shown). By comparison with other homologous steroid receptor cDNAs and cloned steroid receptor genes (hAR, cPR, hER, and hMR) (MR, mineralocorticoid receptor), the probable splice sites of the other as yet unreported steroid receptor gene sequences (hPR, hMR, and hGR) (GR, glucocorticoid receptor) could be predicted. Comparisons of their exons reveal regions of evolutionary conservation of essential functions (Fig. 2). The most highly conserved exons, B and C, encode the first and second zinc finger motifs, respectively, and make up the DNA-binding domain (3-5). Within these and other exons, sequence identity of hAR is closer to hPR, hMR, and hGR than to hER (Fig. 2). Only the second zinc finger exon of hER, exon C, has a high degree of sequence similarity with hAR. The large N-terminal domain contained within the A exon has little similarity with other receptors. This exon appears to contain a transcription-enhancing function and may also modulate DNA binding (3-5). Neither exon A nor exons B and C are known to have any influence on ligand binding. In the ER and GR, it has been demonstrated that the steroid-binding domain encompasses exons E-G and portions of exons D and H (23, 24). hAR exons E-G exhibit a relatively high degree of similarity to hPR, hMR, and hGR (Fig. 2). Although exon D is less homologous overall, a 23-amino acid region positioned near its 3' junction is highly conserved among all nuclear receptors (10). Experimental mutations within this region were found to interfere with ligand binding, suggesting that it is part of a hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket (23, 24, 34).

Indicated are the percent homologies with hAR (boxed) and amino acid residue numbers (below boxes). Intron/exon splice sites are indicated by the vertical dashed lines. Amino acid residue numbers of the splice sites of hAR (this report), hER (14), and the exon B splice sites of hMR (6) are known. hPR splice sites were derived from sequence homology with the known splice sites of cPR (17). The splice sites of hGR and the remaining splice sites of hMR were derived from sequence homology with hAR. Amino acid sequences of the predicted splice sites with the exception of the exon A/B sites were homologous (data not shown). Percent homologies among the same exons of different receptors were calculated by the GAP program of the GCG sequence analysis program (30).  Medical Sciences: Lubahn  et  al.  Proc. Natl. Acad.

In addition, genomic DNA from the other two study, we chose a family in which three 46,XY siblings affected siblings (11-2 and II-3) and their mother (I-1) was expressed AR proteins with abnormal ligand-binding propanalyzed. Each contained the AR allele with a G replaced by erties (28). Affected individuals had the external female an A, while their carrier mother contained, in addition, the phenotype typical of complete AIS with adult male levels of normal allele (Fig. 4). The valine to methionine alteration is circulating testosterone (31) and normal 5a-reductase activity therefore linked to AIS in this family. in genital skin fibroblasts (28). Saturation binding analysis CG dinucleotides, like those found at the locus mutated in with [3H]dihydrotestosterone indicated normal amounts of this family with AIS (Figs. 1 and 3), are in humans sometimes AR in genital skin fibroblasts, and the AR protein had a methylated on the cytidine.

A single base mutation (asterisk and arrows) of G to A resulted in the only identified amino acid sequence change in this kindred.

Although hPR has a leucine at the position corresponding to the AR point mutation, cPR does contain a methionine, as do hGR and hMR (Fig. 3). It is interesting to speculate that this region of the G exon may be important in determining steroid-binding specificity to AR. Estradiol has no increase in affinity for the mutated AR (28), and its receptor has little homology with AR in exon G (Figs. 2 and 3). The exon G mutation has the potential of affecting both the steroid-binding and transcription-activating functions of the AR protein. Ligand binding to AR and other steroid hormone receptors initiates a transformation process that results in enhanced binding of receptors to their hormone response elements (3-5). This process may involve a conformational change in the receptor protein or separation from a nonsteroid-binding component that unmasks the DNA-binding domain and a nuclear transfer sequence located in the Cterminal region downstream from the DNA-binding domain. The process may also activate within the steroid-binding domain a dimerization sequence shown to be required for strong interaction of the steroid receptor with its response element and for transactivation of gene expression (36, 37). The mechanism by which this point mutation, resulting in only a subtle change in steroid-binding properties of the AR, could cause complete loss of AR functional activity is not yet clear. However, it appears that complete transformation of the receptor subsequent to steroid binding requires precise structural interaction between receptor and ligand. Steroid antagonists, for example, have recently been shown to bind ERs and GRs and promote specific binding to hormone response elements without enhancing gene transcription as would a normal agonist (37, 38). Hormone-binding domains of nuclear receptors are now recognized to have transcriptional enhancer effects (24, 38). A point mutation might abolish this function without greatly affecting steroid binding. Expression of this mutated hAR in vitro will allow further studies to determine whether it is capable of binding to its response element and enhancing transcription of a reporter gene. Present evidence suggests that there is a wide spectrum of AR gene mutations causing androgen insensitivity syndrome in humans (1, 2, 20, 21). Such androgen receptor mutations are amenable to study by using the oligonucleotide primers and the PCR method described here. This method of analysis, by allowing correlations of AR structures with AIS phenotypes, should prove valuable in elucidating the mechanisms of action of AR in male sex differentiation and development. Note Added in Proof. After submission of this paper, we learned of a publication (39) in which the structural organization of the hAR gene was partially determined. Their locations for the hAR gene splice sites are in agreement with the sites we have determined.  ttMore recently, we have recreated the natural mutation (amino acid 866, as shown in Fig. 3) in human AR cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed the mutated and wild-type hAR cDNAs in COS cells by a method previously described (7). Binding affinity of the mutated AR for 3H-R1881 (a synthetic androgen) was -4-fold lower than that of the wild-type AR (data not shown). This difference in androgen-binding affinities is similar to that demonstrated earlier in cultured genital skin fibroblasts from normal males and from siblings with AIS in this family (28).

This nucleotide is part of one of the conserved blocks of nucleotides within the promoter region; in vitro expression analyses with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase system showed that this substitution will decrease the effectiveness of transcription. Five subjects had a thalassemia intermedia due to the additional presence of a known classical high hemoglobin (Hb) A2 beta-thalassemia mutation on the second chromosome; their hematologic condition was relatively mild. The three persons with a heterozygosity for the--101 C----T mutation had normal hematologic data without microcytosis but with high-normal levels of Hb A2 and a mild imbalance in chain synthesis. The newly discovered mutation is considered one of the silent types of beta-thalassemia. It is relatively rare because it was absent among several hundred normal and beta-thalassemia chromosomes."

SOUTAR*, B. L. KNIGHT, AND D. D. PATEL Medical Research Council Lipoprotein Team, Hammersmith Hospital, London W12 OHS, United Kingdom  Communicated by George R. Stark, February 27, 1989  ABSTRACT The coding region of the low density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor gene from a patient (MM) with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) has been sequenced from six overlapping 500-base-pair amplified fragments of the cDNA from cultured skin fibroblasts. Two separate single nucleotide base changes from the normal sequence were detected. The first involved substitution of guanine for adenine in the third position of the codon for amino acid residue Cys-27 and did not affect the protein sequence. The second mutation was substitution of thymine for cytosine in the DNA for the codon for amino acid residue 664, changing the codon from CCG (proline) to CTG (leucine) and introducing a new site for the restriction enzyme Pst I. MM is a true homozygote with two identical genes, and the mutation cosegregated with clinically diagnosed FH in his family in which rwst cousin marriages occurred frequently. The amino acid change occurs in the center of growth factor repeat C in the epidermal growth factor precursor-homology domain of the protein, a region of highly conserved sequence between bovine and human LDL receptors, and results in slowed, but complete, maturation of the precursor to the mature form of the receptor and, despite its remoteness from the ligand-binding domain, in impaired binding of LDL. LDL receptors in MM's skin fibroblasts bind less LDL than normal and with reduced affinity. Thus this naturally occurring single point mutation affects both intracellular transport of the protein and ligand binding and occurs in growth factor-like repeat C, a region that has not previously been found to influence LDL binding.  cholesterolemia (FH) and of constructed mutations has shed some light on the function of these different domains in the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. The first NH2terminal 292 residues of the LDL receptor comprise the ligand-binding domain, containing seven cysteine-rich 40amino acid repeats. Mutations in this domain can affect intracellular transport (5, 6) as well as ligand binding (7-9). The next adjacent domain comprises 400 amino acid residues with 35% homology with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor (10). Within this domain are three cysteine-rich repetitive elements (A, B, and C) termed "growth factor-like repeats" (11), which are found in many cell-surface and secreted proteins. Mutational analysis has shown that repeat A, but not B, is required for binding of LDL (9), whereas other mutations in repeats A and B affect recycling of receptors (12). Deletion of the entire domain affects the ability of the receptor protein on the cell surface to bind LDL but has no effect on binding ofligands by the purified receptor on a nitrocellulose blot (12). Mutations in the EGF-precursor homology domain have also been found to prevent the maturation of the precursor protein (9), which is rapidly degraded and fails to reach the cell surface. We have recently described the properties of the LDLreceptor protein in cultured skin fibroblasts from a FH subject (MM) in whom there is both impaired transport of the newly synthesized protein to the cell surface and impaired binding of LDL (13). In this paper, we have determined the sequence of the coding region of the LDL-receptor gene in MM, who is a true homozygote with identical defective genes, and show that the malfunctions are due to a single point mutation that changes proline 664 in growth factor-like repeat C to leucine.  The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is a cell-surface protein that mediates the specific recognition, uptake, and degradation of plasma LDL. During receptor-mediated endocytosis, LDL receptors on the cell surface cluster into coated pits that internalize to form endocytic vesicles from which the receptor recycles to the cell surface, while the ligand is degraded in lysosomes (1). The LDL receptor is synthesized as a precursor protein, of apparent molecular weight 120,000 by gel electrophoresis, and undergoes considerable posttranslational modification by the addition and remodeling of both 0-linked and N-linked carbohydrate chains before it reaches the cell surface as a mature protein of apparent molecular weight 160,000 (2). From cDNA cloning of LDL-receptor mRNA (3) and from the intron-exon structure of the gene (4) it has been predicted that the LDL receptor is an integral membrane protein of 839 amino acid residues that comprises a mosaic of several different domains.

His eldest brother died of coronary disease (age, 23) and, as described elsewhere, MM exhibits the clinical features of homozygous FH type IIB (14). Homozygous and heterozygous FH were diagnosed in MM's family on the basis of their plasma cholesterol concentration.  METHODS Cultured Cells. Skin fibroblasts were maintained in culture as described (15). Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from cultured skin fibroblasts that had been preincubated for 48 hr Abbreviations: FH, familial hypercholesterolemia; LDL, low density lipoprotein; EGF, epidermal growth factor. *To whom reprint requests should be addressed at: Medical Research Council Lipoprotein Team, Hammersmith Hospital, Ducane Road, London W12 OHS, U.K.  The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.

Double-stranded cDNA for the LDLreceptor mRNA was synthesized with a "cDNA synthesis system plus" kit (Amersham), using the protocol described in the kit for 1 gg of poly(A)-rich RNA, with the exceptions that 5-10 Ag of total cytoplasmic RNA was substituted for poly(A)-rich RNA, and a 21-nucleotide oligomer complementary to bases 2609-2577 of the LDL-receptor mRNA was substituted for the primer(s) in the kit, to give a concentration of 50 Ag/ml in the first-strand reaction. Based on the incorporation of dCT32P, the yield of cDNA was :20 ng. For amplification (17), a Gene Amp DNA amplification kit was used (Perkin-Elmer/Cetus). The reaction mix (final volume, 100 ul) contained -2 ng of cDNA and two 21-nucleotide oligomers that delineated 0.5-kilobase (kb) fragments of the coding region (3, 4), to give a final concentration of 5 Ag/ml each. The 5' ends of the oligomers were phosphorylated prior to the amplification reaction using a standard protocol (18). The amplification comprised incubation of the reaction mix at 94TC for 2 min before addition of enzyme; this was followed by 30 cycles of 2 min each at 92TC, 480C, and 720C in turn, using an automated device (19). At the end of the 30th cycle, the samples were incubated for 15 min at 72°C to complete any partial strands. Amplified fragments were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, with or without restriction enzyme digestion, using standard methods (18) and blotted with specific probes for the LDL-receptor cDNA as described (16). Probes specific for each segment were prepared by random primed synthesis labeling with dCT32P (20) of the equivalent amplified fragments of plasmid pLDLR3 (a fulllength cDNA clone for the human LDL receptor, kindly provided by D. Russell, Dallas). Amplified fragments were excised from low-melting-point agarose gels (Sigma) and cloned into the Sma I site of M13mpl8 (21), and their nucleotide sequence was determined using a Sequenase kit (Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge, U.K.). For each fragment, at least one clone with an insert in each orientation was sequenced; where differences were found at least two of each orientation were sequenced or the amplified fragment was analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood or from the nuclear pellets of cultured skin fibroblasts and cultured lymphoblasts (16) essentially as described by Kunkel et al. (22). Genomic DNA was amplified with two 21-nucleotide oligomers that encompassed exons 13 and 14 of the LDLreceptor gene as described above. The reaction mix (100 ,ul) contained 1 ,ug of genomic DNA and 0.5 ,tg each of oligomers M and N (see Fig. 3), and the amplification protocol included  incubation for 20 min at 94°C and 5 min at 650C before the addition of enzyme; this was followed by 30 cycles of alternately 1 min at 910C and 5 min at 65°C, using a Techne programable DW-Block (GRI, Essex, U.K.). RESULTS To determine the structural basis for defects in LDL-receptor function in MM's fibroblasts (13), the sequence of the coding region of the mRNA for the LDL receptor was determined from six overlapping amplified fragments of =0.5 kb each. With each pair of oligomers, when the amplified material was fractionated on an agarose gel and blotted with a series of 32P-labeled probes corresponding to the coding region of the receptor, a single band of expected molecular weight was detected. In each case the MM fragment was indistinguishable in size from a normal fragment. When each amplified fragment from MM was sequenced, two consistent differences were found between the wild-type sequence (3) and the sequence of the cDNA in MM. In fragment AB comprising nucleotides -25 to 470 ofthe coding region, there was a single base change such that the codon for amino acid residue 27 was changed from UGU in the wild type to UGC in MM; this base change does not affect the cysteine residue at this position. This single base change was detected in five of five M13 clones of fragment AB and was found in inserts in both orientations. Other changes were also detected in fragment AB, but each was present in only one of five clones and probably represents errors in the amplifications. The second difference, shown in Fig. 1, occurred in fragment IJ of MM's cDNA where there was a single base change such that the codon for amino acid residue 664 was changed from CCG in the wild type to CUG in MM, substituting leucine for proline at this position. This mutation introduces a new site for the restriction enzyme Pst I in MM's cDNA, as shown in Fig. 2. To confirm that this base change was not an error introduced into the single M13 clone as an artefact of the amplification reaction, and to determine whether MM was homozygous or heterozygous for this mutation, the whole amplified fragment IJ was digested with Pst I. When the digested fragments were analyzed by blotting with a labeled probe specific for fragment IJ, a band of 0.43 kb was detected in normal cDNA, whereas a band of 0.34 kb was detected in MM's cDNA. No fragment of 0.43 kb could be detected in the Pst I-digested amplified fragment IJ from two separate preparations of cytoplasmic RNA from MM's fibroblasts (Fig. 2).

Members of the family who were diagnosed as homozygous had two copies of the mutant gene, whereas heterozygotes had one normal gene and one mutant gene.  DISCUSSION We have described the defective function of LDL receptors in cultured skin fibroblasts from homozygous FH subject MM in detail elsewhere (13, 16). The LDL-receptor mRNA in MM is 5.3 kb and is synthesized at an apparently normal rate; it is also subject to regulation by sterols in the  same way  in normal cells (16). A precursor protein of normal mobility on SDS gels is synthesized at approximately the same rate as in normal cells, but its rate of maturation in MM's cells is delayed so that it has an abnormally long half-life (3 hr rather than 0.5 hr). However, all of the precursor protein eventually reaches the cell surface where it recycles normally, although its half-life is 6 hr rather than 10 hr as in normal cells (13). In fibroblasts cultured in the absence of sterols there is approximately the same amount of LDL-receptor protein as in as  normal cells, but, whereas almost all of the receptors in normal cells are in the mature recycling form, in MM's cells nearly half of the receptor protein is in the precursor form unable to participate in uptake of LDL (13). As well as this defect in intracellular transport of the receptor protein, LDL receptors on the surface of MM fibroblasts show a reduced affinity for both '25I-labeled-LDL and very low density lipoprotein with P-mobility. Furthermore, taking into account the reduced number of recycling receptors in MM's cells compared to normal, LDL receptors in MM's cells bind less ligand per mole of protein than in normal cells. Once bound, the ligand is internalized and degraded normally. These functional differences, together with the observation that MM's cells also bind less of a monoclonal antibody to the bovine LDL receptor (23) per mole of LDL-receptor protein on the cell surface than do normal cells (13), show that there is a major structural defect in the LDL-receptor protein in MM's cells that is different from those described previously (2). Of the two single base changes found consistently in the amplified fragments of the LDL-receptor cDNA from MM's cells only one involved a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein, that of proline 664 to leucine. This mutation introduced a new restriction enzyme site that was present in both copies of MM's LDL-receptor gene, confirming that he was a true homozygote with two functionally identical genes. The mutation also cosegregated with clinically diagnosed FH in MM's large family, which contained two more homozygotes and numerous heterozygotes. Thus it is likely that all of the defective functions of the LDL receptor in MM skin fibroblasts can be ascribed to this single amino acid change. Proline 664 occurs in growth factor-like repeat C, a disulfide- and proline-rich region of the EGF-precursor homology domain of the LDL-receptor protein. This sequence is highly conserved between bovine and human LDL-receptor genes (2), suggesting that it has an important functional role. Because of the large number of proline residues it is likely that this region is of irregular structure, and the difference in amino acid sequence between it and the other two growth factor-like repeats A and B, which resemble more closely the sequence found in the EGF precursor itself, suggests that it is folded differently from them (4). The mutation of proline to leucine might be expected to have a marked effect on the folding of the protein, as it would release the constraint on the flexibility of the chain caused by the rigidity of peptide bonds adjacent to proline (24). Mutations of proline to leucine in other proteins have been found both to markedly stabilize the protein, as in the case of the tryptophan synthase a-subunit (25) and the A repressor protein (26), and to slightly destabilize it, as in the case of T4 lysozyme (27). Experiments to compare the stability of the LDL-receptor protein in MM cells and normal cells are necessary. Previously described mutations in the LDL-receptor gene that affect ligand binding have all been localized to the ligand-binding domain (7-9) or to growth factor repeat A, which is adjacent to the ligand-binding domain (9). Thus it is of considerable interest that LDL binding is also affected by a mutation in growth factor-like repeat C, which is separated from this previously identified binding region by at least 300 amino acid residues in the primary structure of the protein (4). These observations suggest that the receptor protein could be folded so that growth factor-like repeat C is normally in contact with the ligand-binding region or that the change in folding of this region is sufficient to disrupt the normal folding of the binding domain. A third possibility is that the change in structure may disrupt some interaction between receptor protein molecules on the cell surface that is essential for optimum ligand binding.

Several different mutations in the LDL-receptor gene that affect transport of the newly synthesized protein to the cell surface have been described (28). One of these, the Lebanese mutation, is also located in growth factor-like repeat C, where the codon for Cys-660 is changed to a stop codon. The truncated protein produced is not processed and becomes rapidly degraded (29). Of more interest in relation to the mutation in MM's gene is that of FH 429 (28) in which the glycine at 544 is changed to valine. In FH 429 cells, the receptor is not processed to the mature form and is again more rapidly degraded than normal; thus the effect of this mutation on processing and transport is different from that of the proline -* leucine at 664 in the LDL receptor in MM's cells.

"1","A high proportion of ADA point mutations associated with a specific alanine-to-valine substitution.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 45:354-361, 1989  A High Proportion of ADA Pint Mutations Associated with Specific Alanine-to-Valine Substitution  a  M. Louise Markert, * Colette Norby-Slycord, * and Frances E. Ward1 Department of Pediatrics, Division of Allergy and Immunology, and tDepartment of Microbiology and Immunology, Division of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC  Summary In 15%-20% of children with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), the underlying defect is adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. The overall goal of our research has been to identify the precise molecular defects in patients with ADA-deficient SCID. In this study, we focused on a patient whom we found to have normal sized ADA mRNA by Northern analysis and an intact ADA structural gene by Southern analysis. By cloning and sequencing this patient's ADA cDNA, we found a C-to-T point mutation in exon 11. This resulted in the amino acid substitution of a valine for an alanine at position 329 of the ADA protein. Sequence analysis revealed that this mutation created a new Banl restriction site. Using Southern analyses, we were able to directly screen individuals to determine the frequency of this mutation. By combining data on eight families followed at our institution with data on five other families reported in the literature, we established that five of 13 patients (seven of 22 alleles) with known or suspected point mutations have this defect. This mutation was found to be associated with three different ADA haplotypes. This argues against a founder effect and suggests that the mutation is very old. In summary, a conservative amino acid substitution is found in a high proportion of patients with ADA deficiency; this can easily be detected by Southern analysis.  Introduction Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a syndrome characterized by a profound deficiency in B- and T-cell function (Bortin and Rimm 1977). Infants born with this disorder die in the first few years of life unless treated successfully by bone marrow transplantation or kept in a sterile isolation facility (Bortin and Rimm 1977; Buckley et al. 1986). In most cases of SCID the underlying molecular defect is unknown. In 15% of the patients, however, a deficiency of the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA; E.C.3.5.4.4) is found (Kredich and Hershfield 1983; Buckley et al. 1986) and is thought to be responsible for their immunodeficiency (Giblett et al. 1972).

The specific mutations found to date have been similar to those found in other inherited disorders. In most patients Northern RNA analyses have revealed normal sized ADA mRNA (Adrian et al. 1984), suggesting that most ADA mutant alleles carry a point mutation leading to an inactive or unstable ADA protein. In eight mutant ADA cDNAs sequenced to date, point mutations affecting amino acid sequence have been found (Bonthron et al. 1985; Valerio et al. 1986; Akeson et al. 1987, 1988). One patient has been described with abnormal sized ADA mRNA, and an RNA splicing defect was identified in this case (Akeson et al. 1987). In two patients, no ADA mRNA has been detected. These patients have been shown to carry deletions encompassing the first exon and promoter regions of the ADA gene (Berkvens et al. 1987; Markert et al. 1988). We are interested in elucidating the molecular defect  355  Common Point Mutation in ADA Deficiency in patients with ADA deficiency who are well characterized clinically and immunologically. In this study, we began our work by focusing on one patient, LB, who was previously shown to have very low levels of ADA enzyme activity (Markert et al. 1987a). The research described in the present paper led to the precise definition of the mutation in this patient, a point mutation leading to the substitution of valine for alanine in the ADA protein. As the point mutation created a restriction-site polymorphism, it was possible by Southern analysis to screen additional patients for this mutation. The surprising result of this study was that five of 13 patients (seven of 23 alleles) were found to carry this mutation. These patients represented a wide diversity of ethnic and racial backgrounds. This is an unusually high percentage of a particular mutation in an unselected population.  Probes  The ADA cDNA and genomic probes were provided by Dr. John Hutton (Cincinnati). The cDNA and first exon genomic probes used in figures 1 and 2 have been described in detail elsewhere (Markert et al. 1987b). The genomic probe used in figure 4 is the 849-bp-PstIPstI genomic fragment whose 3' end is in exon 11. The genomic probe mentioned in table 1 is the 299-bp PstIPstI genomic fragment whose 5' end is in exon 5 (see Wiginton et al. 1986 for sequences). The actin control probe, pHF1A.1, a cDNA for human fibroblast cytoplasmic 13 actin (Gunning et al. 1983), was provided by Dr. Larry Kedes (Stanford). The probes were labeled with 32p to a specific activity of >108 cpm/ pg by using the random primer method (Feinberg and Vogelstein 1983, 1984). cDNA Synthesis, Cloning, and Sequencing  Material and Methods Cell Lines  B lymphoblastoid cell lines were established from Ficoll-Hypaque-purified peripheral mononuclear cells by Epstein-Barr virus transformation (Markert et al. 1987b; Katsuki and Hinuma 1975). The patients reported in the present paper have been extensively studied clinically at Duke University Medical center (Buckley et al. 1986; Markert et al. 1987a). Enzymatic studies have confirmed the patients' lack of ADA enzymatic activity (Markert et al. 1987a). HLA typing was used to confirm the identity of the cell lines. RNA and DNA Purification from the Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines  RNA was harvested by the technique of Chirgwin (1979; Markert et al. 1987b) by using guanidine isothiocyanate extraction and purification by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. Poly A+ RNA was isolated according to a method described elsewhere (Avis and Leder 1972). DNA was purified by the method of Gustafson et al. (1987). Southern DNA Analyses  These analyses were done using minor modifications of the standard technique of Southern (Southern 1975), as described by Markert et al. (1987b). Northern RNA Analyses  These analyses were done using formaldehyde agarose gels according to a method described elsewhere (Markert et al. 1987b).  cDNA was prepared by the method of Gubler and Hoffman (1983). The cDNA was size-selected by the potassium-acetate-gradient method of Aruffo and Seed (1987). EcoRI adapters (Pharmacia) were added, and the cDNA was cloned into XgtlO (Promega). This was packaged (Promega) and titered on Escherichia coli C600hfl. Two hundred thousand plaques were screened by hybridization after transfer to nitrocellulose filters by Benton and Davis plaque hybridization (Benton and Davis 1977). DNA from positive clones was purified by a plate lysate method (Maniatis et al. 1982), and recombinants were confirmed by restriction-endonuclease mapping. cDNAs were subcloned into pUC and then into M13 vectors. Both strands of five cDNA isolates were sequenced by dideoxy chain-termination analysis (Sanger et al. 1977; Markert et al. 1988). Results ADA mRNA Levels  Figure 1 shows RNA blot hybridization (Northern blot) of poly A+ RNA isolated from the B cell lines established from the ADA-deficient patient LB, her parents, and a normal control. The probe used in panel A was the BamHI-AccI fragment of the ADA cDNA, which contains exons 2-12. Lanes 1-4 contain poly A+ RNA. All individuals show ADA mRNA of the correct size (approximately 1,500 bases).

These were subcloned into M13 for sequencing. The regions of the five cDNAs that were sequenced are indicated in figure 3. Four of the five encompassed all the protein-coding portion of the ADA cDNA (positions 96-1184). Only two differences were found in comparing the wild-type sequence to the LB cDNA. Patient LB has XgtlO, and 200,000 plaques were screened.  Common Point Mutation in ADA Deficiency  357  a C-to-T mutation in exon 11 (position 1081) of the cDNA according to Wiginton et al. [1986]) and a G-toA polymorphism in exon 6 (position 629 ofthe cDNA). The mutation at position 1081 causes an amino acid substitution of valine for alanine at position 329 of the protein sequence. The polymorphism at position 629 does not affect the amino acid sequence.

Patient LB demonstrates only the abnormal restriction fragment of 1.8 kb. Both of her parents carry one normal fragment of 2.6 kb and one abnormal fragment of 1.8 kb. Thus, patient LB is homozygous for this mutation. Because of the cDNA sequencing studies shown in figure 3, we feel confident that this is the only mutation in this patient's ADA mRNA. Seven additional ADA-deficient patients (and/or their parents) followed at our institution were screened by Southern analysis in looking for this mutation. As can be seen in figure 4, two additional patients from the seven families tested carried this mutation; one (patient JB) in addition to LB is homozygous for the mutation, and another (patient BJ) is heterozygous for the muta-  Sequencing Strategy Normal 0  ADA cDNA  f=ATc  +1498 AAAA  cDNA isolate +33  +1498  1  +32  +1498  2  +158  +1ns  3  +1498  4  +1489  5  +32  i  -14  629 GTG-GTA VAL-VAL  1081 GCG-GTG ALA-VAL  Figure 3 Sequence analysis of the ADA cDNA from patient LB.

The homozygous state found in LB and JB can likely be explained by their parents being related. The LB parents come from a small town and believe it is possible that they could have an ancestor in common. The parents of JB are known to be related. Since DNA from BJ's father is not available, it is not known whether BJ inherited the 1081 mutation or whether it was a spontaneous mutation. LB, JB, and BJ are not related to each other by recent intermarriage. They, GM2756, and GM2825A come from widely scattered regions of the United States and include both white and black individuals.  Markert  358 The sequences of five mutant alleles (GM1751, GM2471, GM2756, GM2825A, and GM2606) have been published elsewhere (see Akeson et al. 1987 for previous summary; also see Akeson et al. 1988). Two of the five (GM2825A and GM2756) carry the 1081 mutation. When our data are combined with data previously published, we see that five of 13 patients and seven of 22 alleles with point mutations carry this mutation. This is a relatively high frequency of a single point mutation in this population. In an assessment of gene frequency, it is important to determine which alleles are not included in the compilation. In this study, although 13 patients were examined, 22- not 26- alleles are included. In four individuals, only one allele is listed. For GM2471, only one cDNA was successfully cloned (Valerio et al. 1986); no comment can be made about the second allele. For GM1715, the patient had "partial" ADA deficiency (Wolf et al. 1976); one ADA cDNA was normal (Bonthron et al. 1985). For GM2825A, the second allele carries an RNA splicing problem (Akeson et al. 1987); thus, it is not included in this compilation of point mutations. For one of our ADA-deficient patients, only DNA from the mother was available, since the patient had died in 1977. Thus, only one parental allele could be examined by Southern analysis. Our assessment of gene frequency in this population may be somewhat high because we included both alleles of patient LB and JB. The parents ofJB are related, and the parents of LB probably are related. Some investigators would count each patient only once. This would lower the observed frequency of this mutation to 25%. On the other hand, we may have underestimated the frequency of this mutation, since, in the case of two patients (three alleles), no patient material was available and parent DNA was screened. One of these parents might have been normal, and the affected patient might have carried a spontaneous mutation on one allele. This would not have been detected by examination of parent DNA. Of 19 mutant alleles examined from patient material, seven carried the 1081 mutation. If only one allele each of LB and JB are counted, then five of 17 alleles examined from patient material carry the 1081 mutation. A total of five other point mutations have been scattered throughout the ADA gene. None of these mutations create restriction-site changes that lend themselves to screening by Southern analysis. In contrast to the 1081 alanine-to-valine mutation described in the present paper, none of the other mutations leading to amino  et  al.  acid substitutions have been detected more than two times in the 10 alleles that have been fully sequenced. Analysis of ADA Haplotypes in Patients Carrying the 1081 Mutation  Table 1 divides the seven alleles carrying the 1081 mutation into three ADA haplotypes. The first three alleles (the first haplotype) come from two white patients, GM2825A and LB. Sequence analysis has shown that these three alleles carry an "A" at position 629. The homozygosity of patient LB at position 629 was confirmed by Southern analysis (data not shown). The second three alleles (the second haplotype) comes from two black patients, GM2756 and JB. These three alleles carry a "G" at position 629. GM2756's allele was sequenced (Akeson et al. 1988). The nucleotide at 629 in patient JB's alleles was determined by Southern analysis (data not shown). The third haplotype is represented by the affected allele of patient BJ. Southern analysis reveals a restriction fragment that is of a different size than those found in patients LB and JB (see table 1). Thus, there are at least three haplotypes associated with the 1081 mutation. The possibility also exists that there may be more than three haplotypes, since DNA from GM2825A and GM2756 was not examined by Southern analysis.  Table I Three ADA Haplotypes Found in Association with the  1081 Mutation Restriction Fragment Sizea  Mutant Allele (race)  629  GM2825A-a (W) ...... LB-a (W) ............. LB-b (W) ............

A 1.9-kb restriction fragment is detected by Southern analysis if a G is present at position 629 of exon 6. A common polymorphism occurs when an A is present at 629. Ball can then not cut at 629; a longer restriction fragment of 3.2 kb is usually detected. Finding a 2.9-kb fragment is unusual. Data on GM2825A are ..............  from Akeson et al. (1987); data on GM2756 are from Akeson et al. (1988). The two alleles from each patient are designated a and b.  359  Common Point Mutation in ADA Deficiency Discussion  The question arises as to why the 1081 mutation is found so frequently in this ADA-deficient patient population. Since three different ADA haplotypes are shown to carry the 1081 mutation, two possibilities are most likely: either this is a very old mutation or position 1081 is a hot spot for mutation. The finding of three haplotypes is not consistent with a founder effect. It is possible that the CpG dinucleotide at position 1081 is a hot spot for mutation. The dinucleotide CpG is known to frequently be associated with C-to-T mutations and with G-to-A mutations (reviewed in Cooper and Youssoufian 1988). The vast majority of CG mutations are CG-TG or CG-CA, consistent with methylation-induced deamination of 5-methylcytosine (Coulondre et al. 1978). This type of mutation was involved not only in the 1081 mutation reported in the present paper but also in three of the other five mutations described to date (CG to TG at 396, CG to CA at 397, and CG to CA at 727; the numbers refer to the cDNA sequence of Wiginton et al. [1986]). It is not involved in the mutations at either position 334 or position 1006. Thus, four of six mutations reported for ADA deficiency involve this dinucleotide. What is unknown is why there is such a predominance of mutations in the CpG at position 1081, as opposed to any of the other CpG dinucleotides in the ADA cDNA. Our conclusions regarding this mutation in ADA deficiency contrast with recent findings in phenylketonuria (PKU). In PKU, certain mutations are associated with particular PKU haplotypes (DiLella et al. 1986, 1987). This suggests that all individuals with a given mutation descended from a common ancestor (founder effect). With the 1081 ADA mutation, individuals carrying the same mutation have different ADA haplotypes. This argues against the founder effect. It remains to be determined how the 1081 mutation causes a lack of ADA enzyme activity. The mutation is a conservative amino acid substitution of valine for alanine. One would not predict this mutation to significantly affect protein hydrophobicity or secondary structure (Garnier et al. 1978; Akeson et al. 1988). Some information has already been published regarding this mutation. Akeson et al. (1988) conducted in vitro transfection experiments using a cDNA whose only abnormality was the 1081 mutation. They found markedly decreased levels of ADA activity, compared with experiments using the normal ADA cDNA (Akeson et al. 1988). Western blots of cell lysates from the cell line GM2825A, which is heterozygous for this mutation  (Akeson et al. 1987), showed no immunoreactive material (Wiginton and Hutton 1982). Akeson concluded from their studies that the mutant protein (Ala to Val, 1081) may be unstable or structurally altered (Akeson et al. 1988). Ultimate proof will require in vitro mutagenesis of the 1081 mutation to wild type and demonstration of restored ADA activity. To investigate these possibilities, in vitro translation experiments are currently underway with wild-type and mutant constructs. Regardless of why the 1081 mutation is so common, this observation may prove useful in patient studies. Patients can easily be screened by Southern analysis. In a high frequency of cases, this test will reveal the underlying mutation of at least one allele.

J Reticuloendothelial Soc 20:48A  In 15%-20% of children with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), the underlying defect is adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. The overall goal of our research has been to identify the precise molecular defects in patients with ADA-deficient SCID. In this study, we focused on a patient whom we found to have normal sized ADA mRNA by Northern analysis and an intact ADA structural gene by Southern analysis. By cloning and sequencing this patient's ADA cDNA, we found a C-to-T point mutation in exon 11. This resulted in the amino acid substitution of a valine for an alanine at position 329 of the ADA protein. Sequence analysis revealed that this mutation created a new BalI restriction site. Using Southern analyses, we were able to directly screen individuals to determine the frequency of this mutation. By combining data on eight families followed at our institution with data on five other families reported in the literature, we established that five of 13 patients (seven of 22 alleles) with known or suspected point mutations have this defect. This mutation was found to be associated with three different ADA haplotypes. This argues against a founder effect and suggests that the mutation is very old. In summary, a conservative amino acid substitution is found in a high proportion of patients with ADA deficiency; this can easily be detected by Southern analysis."

Amplification of genomic DNA from blood and tissue samples by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)8 method, using synthetic oligonucleotides specific for the mutated exons, now permits accurate diagnosis of these mutations after restriction enzyme digestion and electrophoresis of the DNA.  Material and methods Patients and families  Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) gene located on chromosome 19. 1 The defective receptor causes LDL to accumulate to high levels in plasma, which eventually leads to atherosclerosis and premature heart attacks. The prevalence of the disease is very high (1 in 80) in the white Mrikaans-speaking section of ·the South Mrican population. 2 A founder gene effect has been suggested to explain the high frequency of FH in this so-called Afrikaner population. 3 The Afrikaner has indeed a history of a small founder co=unity, which remained isolated through religious belief and cultural bonds. We recently reported on the segregation of genetic markers in and around the LDL-R gene in the FH and unaffected Afrikaner populations. Evidence was presented that at least two founders must have been responsible for the high frequency of FH in this population group.4 Haplotype studies showed that a presumed defective gene co-segregated with the rare allele of a Nco I restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)5 in 70% of FH families. A second haplotype, determined by the rare allele of the Sru I enzyme, 6 co-segregated with a second gene defect in 20% of FH families. This association was confirmed in genetic marker studies in 27 FH homozygotes. 7 To date the diagnosis of FH in South Africa relied on the measurement of total or LDL cholesterol levels.

Blood samples were obtained from the FH patients, their families and normocholesterolaemic individuals, as previously described. 4 .7  Genomic cloning A genomic library was constructed in lambda L47.1 using Bgl II digested DNA from an FH patient who was known to have the rare allele of Sw I haplotype. A recombinant clone (FH8-30) was isolated from the library using a 1,05 kb Psr I subclone of pLDLR-3, a full-length cDNA clone, as a probe. 7 Restriction endonuclease mapping and Southern blotting indicated that the 15 kb Bgl 11 clone FH8-30 contained exons 4 - 11 of the LDL-R gene. The insert also lacked the Sw I binding site in exon 8. A 7 kb Hind Ill/Barn HI fragment of the clone was further subcloned into pBR 328 and used for DNA sequencing.  DNA amplification Genomic and cloned DNA amplification using Taq polymerase (Amersham) was performed according to the procedure described by Saiki er af.9 The following oligonucleotide primers (Beckman Instruments) were used for amplification of specific exons of the LDL-R gene: Exon 4: 5' end - 5'-CATCCATCCCTGCAGCCCCC-3' (H) 3' end - 5'-CCATACCGCAGTTTTCCTCG-3' (I) Exon 9: 5' end - 5'-GCTCCATCGCCTACCTCTTC-3' 3' end - 5'-CTGCAGATCATTCTCTGGGA-3' The PCR products were used for either direct DNA sequencing or enzyme digestion and electrophoresis.  DNA sequencing DNA fragments were sequenced by the dideoxy chaintermination method iO using the oligonucleotide primers specific for the exons as described above. Both strands were sequenced (Taq Track, Promega). The results were compared with the normal sequence. !I  400  SAMJ  VOL 76  21 OCT 1989  Restriction digests of amplified DNA Aliquots (50 J,LI) of amplified DNA sequences were digested with the specific restriction enzyme and electrophoresed in 2% agarose gels. The DNA fragments were stained with ethidium bromide and visualised by ultraviolet fluorescence.  This mutation was observed by comparing the cloned sequences with those found in a normal allele. The existence of this mutation was further cOnIlIDled in DNA sequence analysis of 3 additional FH patients who carry the rare Sru I allele as a marker.  Restriction enzyme digests  Results Single base substitution in exon 4 A single base substirution at position 523 was observed in the DNA sequence of exon 4 of the LDL-R gene cloned from an FH patient in whom the rare allele of the Sw I polymorphism co-segregates with the disease. In Fig. lA the guanine to adenine transition is marked in the partial autoradiogram.  From the DNA sequence data of the normal and mutated exon 4 and the known binding sites of the available restriction enzymes, we deduced that there would be a loss of an Mho 11 enzyme binding site in DNA of individuals with the mutated allele. DNA from a normal individual, the cloned fragment (FH8-30) and a Sw I-associated FH patient was amplified by peR and digested with Mho 11 (Fig. 2).

The digestion of DNA from the cloned fragment resulted in one fragment of 400 bp indicating loss of the Mbo II binding site (lane 2). DNA from a FH heterozygote showed heterozygosity after digestion by Mbo II (lane 3). This confirms that the enzyme did not digest the DNA of the mutated allele, while that of the normal allele was digested.  Analysis of the exon 4 mutation in normal and FH families The presence of the exon 4 mutation, using PCR-amplified DNA and restriction digestion with Mbo II, was studied in 2 informative FH families of whom 10 members were FH heterozygotes with the associated rare Sru I allele. The presence of the mutation, as seen by the absence of the Mbo II restriction site in the amplified DNA of affected heterozygotes, correlates with high LDL cholesterol levels in these individuals. This is a further confirmation that the exon 4 mutation dQes indeed cause the disease in these families. The absence of the mutation in 20 normal individuals, of whom 6 were also found to have the associated rare Sru I allele, further substantiates this finding.  VOL. 76  21 OKT 1989  401  Discussion DNA" from a compound homozygote was cloned and the Sw I-associated allele of the LDL-R gene was isolated from the library for further characterisation. A point mutation was observed in exon 4 of this allele, causing loss of an Mho II binding site. Evidence that the mutation causes the disease in these families was demonstrated in studies where the mutation was seen to segregate with high LDL cholesterol levels. Preliminary data indicate that this mutation occurs in all Sru 1associated FH patients. Extrapolation of the haplotype data indicates that the exon 4 mutation will account for about 20% of the founder-related defect in the Afrikaner population. In 2 FH homozygotes with the associated Nco I allele a point mutation was found in exon 9. This mutation resulted in the loss of an Mae II binding site. Population screening for the incidence of this mutation in FH patients will reveal whether all the Nco I-associated FH patients have the same exon 9 mutation of the gene. Accurate diagnosis of these mutations is now possible by Mho II and Mae II digestion of PCR-amplified DNA. This study has shown that direct molecular diagnosis of these gene mutations in familial hypercholesterolaemia is simple, reliable and allows for rapid unequivocal diagnosis of the disease. Identification of the defective genes in heterozygous parents also permits the prenatal diagnosis of homozygosity in chorionic or amniotic tissue of the fetus and offers the possibility for termination of the pregnancy.  REFERENCES  Single base substitution in exon 9 A single base substitution at position 1285 was observed in the DNA sequence of exon 9 from amplified DNA of 2 FH homozygotes, in whom the rare allele of the Nco I RFLP cosegregates with the disease. In Fig. IB the guanine to adenine transition is marked in the partial autoradiogram. The mutation was observed by comparing the sequence data of exon 9 of both alleles of two homozygotes with the sequence data from normal controls. From the sequence data of both the normal and the mutated allele of exon 9, we deduced that there would be a loss of the restriction enzyme binding site of the enzyme Mae II in individuals with the mutated allele. Using the oligonucleotides for exon 9 as primers, the amplified DNA from true homozygotes would not digest using the enzyme Mae II. The heterozygotes would show a similar heterozygosity in fragment sizes as was illustrated for exon 4 mutation. The Mae II enzyme was not readily available for further studies prior to publication.

"1","Hobbs et al. (N. Engl. J. Med. 317: 734-737, 1987) reported a large deletion of approximately 10 kilobases in the 5' portion of the human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene. This deletion affects about 60% of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) heterozygotes in the French Canadian population.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized clinically by elevated serum cholesterol levels, tendon xanthomas, and myocardial infarction at an early age (Goldstein & Brown 1983). It is an autosomal dominant disorder with a heterozygote frequency in western populations of about 1 in 500 (Goldstein & Brown 1983, Brown & Goldstein 1986). Studies of the molecular basis of this disease have revealed that mutations in the gene coding for the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor are the primary cause (Brown & Goldstein 1986), and more than 20 different mutations have been  identified to date (Russell et al. 1986, Hobbs et al. 1988, Langlois et al. 1988, Leitersdorf et al. 1988, Henderson et al. 1988). The LDL receptor, located on the surface of most body cells, plays a key role in the removal of cholesterol-rich LDL from the circulation. The LDL receptor cDNA has been cloned and sequenced (Yamamoto et al. 1984), and the gene, 45 kilobases (lcb) in length, has been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 19 (Siidhof et al. 1985). Cloned cDNA fragments of the LDL rcceptor have been used as probes to determine the molecular basis of the mutations (Rus-  220  MA E T A L .

The sizes of the introns in kilobases (kb) are indicated above the gene map. Underneath the gene map Is a partial restriction map of the LDL receptor cDNA. The 0.85 kb Pstl-EcoRI fragment covering exons 2, 3. 4, and part of exon 5 was used as a probe in this study.

The expected  restriction fragments are indicated in pairs. The uppermost pair has been described previously by Hobbs e l ai. (1987) using a 123 bp cDNA probe covering axon 2. The remaining two pairs are detected as restrictlon fragment variants in this study using the 0.65 kb cDNA probe described in Panel A.  sell et al. 1986, Hobbs et al. 1988, Langlois et al. 1988). Recently, Hobbs et al. (1987) reported a common deletion of approximately 10 kb in the 5' portion of the LDL receptor gene. This deletion, found exclusively in a French Canadian population and shared by 63% of FH heterozygotes in this group, was thought to be the result of a founder effect. This deletion (French Canadian deletion) removes the 5' signal sequence, initiation codon, and the first exon of the LDL receptor gene, and therefore prevents the expression of the deletion-bearing allele. This deletion was demonstrated as a restriction  fragment length variant by genomic Southem blot analysis using double digestion with the restriction enzymes KpnI and XbaI and a single-stranded cDNA probe corresponding to exon 2 (Hobbs et al. 1987). The single-stranded labeling technique (Church & Gilbert 1984) is relatively cumbersome for routine use in a small laboratory. In this communication, we report a more rapid, convenient screening method for the deletion using double digestion with the restriction enzymes XbaI and EcoRV or triple digestion with the restriction enzymes XbaI, EcoRV and XmnI, and a doublestranded 650 bp cDNA probe spanning  R A P I D S C R E E N I N G O F D E L E T I O N S I N L D L R E C E P T O R GENE221  exon 2,3,4, and 5 of the LDL receptor gene, labeled using a random primer technique (Feinberg & Vogelstein 1983). This method gives clear, distinct restriction fragments which distinguish FH heterozygotes with and without the deletion, and is reliable, reproducible, and better suited to routine use. The Southern analysis with the XbaI/ EcoRV co-digestion also revealed a new mutation which occurred in 5% of FH heterozygotes studied. We show this mutation to be a 5 Kb deletion removing exons 2 and 3 of the LDL receptor gene. Material and Methods  Subjecrs Eighty French-Canadian FH heterozygotes, all unrelated to the second degree, were selected for this study. The diagnosis of FH was based on the following criteria: family  history of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) (<45 years of age), an LDLcholesterol greater than 250 mg/dl, the presence of premature CAD and/or tendon xanthomas. cDNA Probe Preparation Clone pLDLR3, a modified pcDVl clone containing a full-length LDL receptor cDNA, was purchased from the Repository of Human DNA Probes and Libraries, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland. The clone was grown and the insert containing plasmid DNA was purified using a rapid method described by Pfeffer & Mierendorf (1986). The plasmid DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases PstI and EcoRI under conditions recommended by the manufacturers (Gibco-BRL), and a 650 bp PstI-EcoRI cDNA fragment was excised following electrophoresis on a 1.5% low melting point  1 2 3 4  1 2 3 4  1 2 3 4 5  6  C.  6.

The filters were then washed in ZxSSC, 0.1 % SDS for 15 min at room temperature, and twice in 0.1 x SSC, 0.5% SDS for 20 min at 65°C. The filters were exposed to Kodak X-Omat RP films using one intensifying screen for 24 to 48 h at-70°C. Results  The French Canadian deletion was originally demonstrated by Hobbs et al. (1987) using XbaI/KpnI double restriction digestion and a specific-primed, single-stranded cDNA probe covering exon 2 of the LDLreceptor gene. This showed restriction fragment variation which allowed distinction of the normal allele from the allele carrying the 10 kb deletion (Hobbs et al. 1987). As shown in Fig. lB, the normal allele (N) produces a 9 kb restriction fragment while the deletion-bearing allele (D) gives a 15 kb fragment. We have tried to find a random-primed, double-stranded cDNA probe for the rapid screening of French Canadian FH heterozygotes for the deletion. The random oligonucleotide primer technique is now probably the most commonly utilized method for probe labeling. Compared to the singlestranded labeling procedure, the random primer method is very easy to follow and reduces the total labeling time from 4 h to 40 min. Moreover, prepacked random primer labeling kits can be purchased from many manufacturers, so that radio-labeled probes with consistently high specific activity can be obtained. We therefore used the random primer method to label a 650 bp fragment of the LDL receptor cDNA (Fig. 1A) which spans exons 2, 3, 4, and  part of exon 5. We replaced the restriction enzyme KpnI in our analysis with one of a group of other enzymes (mostly 6-cutters) which were used in combination with XbaI. KpnI was replaced for two principal reasons.First, the removal of KpnI from digestion removes a common KpnI-XbaI fragment of approximately 15 kb detected by the 3' portion of the 650 bp probe, which therefore masks out the 15 kb XbaI-KpnI fragment carrying the deletion. Second, the removal of KpnI maximizes the overlap between the probe and target fragments, so that not only exon 2 but also exons 3, 4, and part of exon 5 will be involved in hybridization. This ensures high intensity and reproducibility of the bands seen in the Southern analysis. A series of double and triple digestions with XbaI and different combinations of enzymes was performed in order to find a combination which would give higher intensity, better separation, and consistent reproducibility of the bands. These digestions included: XbaI/BamHI, XbaI/EcoRI, XbaI/SphI, XbaI/SstI, XbaI/ StuI, XbaI/EcoRV, XbaI/EcoRV/BglI, XbaI/EcoRV/HincII, XbaI/EcoRV/HpaI, XbaI/EcoRV/NcoI, XbaI/EcoRV/PstI, and XbaI/EcoRV/XmnI. ' h o of these digestions, XbaI/EcoRV and XbaI/EcoRV/ XmnI, showed clean and distinct restriction fragments (Fig. lB, and Fig. 2). No other combinations were found to be useful. Fig. 1B shows a partial restriction map of the LDL-receptor gene and the expected restriction fragments. The normal allele is expected to generate a 19 kb fragment upon XbaI/EcoRV double digestion, or a 12 kb fragment upon XbaI/EcoRV/XmnI triple digestion. The deletion-carrying allele is expected to produce a 25 kb fragment upon double or a 19 kb fragment upon triple digestion. Autoradiograms of hybridized Southern blots are shown in Fig. 2.

The first two lanes contain DNA from two healthy French Canadians, and, as expected, show only a normal 19 kb band. The next two lanes (lanes 3 and 4) represent samples from two FH heterozygotes who were known to carry the 10 kb deletion, and show a 25 kb deletion band as well as a normal band. We then screened 80 French Canadian FH heterozygotes for the presence of the deletion. Shown in Fig. 2B is an autoradiogram of the results from six individuals. Two of them are carriers of the 10 kb deletion (lanes 2 and 6), and the remaining four patients do not have the deletion. One of these four patients carries a mutation which gives a 14 kb abnormal band (lane 5). and the other FH heterozygotes who show no other abnormal band must carry other mutations in their LDLreceptor gene which are not detectable by this analysis. Forty-seven out of the 80 FH patients (59%) were found to carry the 10 kb deletion, and four patients ( 5 % ) were found to carry the mutation that produced the 14 kb band.  Since the abnormal 14 kb band is smaller than the 19 kb normal band, it is very likely to be due to one of two possibilities: either a single-nucleotide alteration (point mutation) that has created an XbaI or EcoRV site, or a 5 kb deletion which has occurred in between the XbaI and EcoRV sites. These possibilities can be distinguished using a simple strategy: that is, to introduce a third enzyme, other than XbaI or EcoRV. If the abnormal band is caused by a point mutation, the introduction of a third enzyme into the Southern analysis should not give the abnormal band, because the mutation site would not have been challenged. However, if the observed abnormal band is caused by a 5 kb deletion, an abnormal band should always be found, no matter what enzyme is used. To find out the nature and the location of the mutation underlying the 14 kb abnormal band shown in Fig. 2B, Southern analysis was performed with a group of restriction enzymes whose cutting sites along the LDL receptor gene have been previously mapped. Fig. 3A shows the auto-  226  .MA E T A L .  radiogram of the BamHI digestion probed with the 650 bp cDNA probe. The first two lanes contain DNAs from normal individuals and, as expected, have only a normal 15 kb band. The next two lanes, FH6667 and FH5272, contain DNAs from two of the four FH heterozygotes who were found to carry the “14 kb band mutation” in the previous XbaI/EcoRV co-digestion. A 10 kb abnormal band as well as a normal 15 kb band are observed. This indicates that the new mutation is due to a 5 kb deletion and the deletion is located in between the two BamHI sites (Fig. 3A). To narrow down further the range within which the deletion is located, an EcoRI digestion was performed. Fig. 3B shows the result from two normal controls and two deletion carriers, and the latter show a 4 kb abnormal band in addition to a 9 kb normal band, indicating that the 5 kb deletion is located in between the two EcoRI sites (Fig. 3B). A BglII digestion (Fig. 3C) and an XmnI digestion (Fig. 3D) were then performed to determine the 3’ boundary of the deletion. A 16 kb (larger than normal) abnormal band is observed in Fig. 3C, indicating that the BglII site in the third intron is removed by the deletion. Only a normal 13 kb band (Fig. 3D) is found in both normals and patients in the XmnI digestion. This indicates that the XmnI site in the third intron is not removed, and that the reason that an abnormal 8 kb band is not seen is because the probe-hybridizing region (exons 2 and 3) in the fragment is deleted (Fig. 3D).Combining the results of Fig. 3C and 3D, we infer that the 3’ boundary of the deletion is located in between the BglII and XmnI sites in intron 3, which are approximately 700 bp apart. Given the location of the 3’ boundary and the size of the deletion (5 kb), we predicted that this deletion removed both exons 2 and 3. Two more digestions were performed to confirm this prediction. Fig. 3E shows the result from a KpnI/  XbaI double digestion and, as expected, all four FH heterozygotes with the 5 kb deletion show a larger abnormal band (19 kb), indicating that the KpnI site in intron 2 is removed. Fig. 3F is an autoradiogram of the SphI digestion and, as expected, all four of these FH patients show an abnormal 5 kb fragment as well as the normal 10 kb band, indicating that the SphI site in intron 1 is not removed. The results from all six digestions shown in Fig. 3 confirm that this is a 5 kb deletion removing exons 2 and 3. The limits of this deletion do not coincide with any of those previously described (Hobbs et a]. 1988, Langlois et al. 1988, Henderson, H. E. 1988). The results of a co-segregation study are shown in Fig. 4. The 5 kb deletion is inherited in a Mendelian fashion in this family. The deletion also cosegregates with the FH phenotype. Discussion  The LDL receptor is a single-chain transmembrane glycoprotein with five modular domains encoded by 17 exons (exons 2 to 18). The first domain at the N-terminal, the LDL receptor binding domain, consists of 7 cysteine-rich repeats encoded by exons 2 to 6 (Russell et al. 1986). Exons 2, 3, 5 and 6 each encode one repeat (41 amino acids) and exon 4 encodes three repeats. One unique feature about these exons for the binding domain is that the introns in this region interrupt the coding sequence in the same reading frame. Thus, if any one of these exons is removed in its entirety, mRNA splicing can still be carried out and the correct reading frame will be retained. In the case of the 5 kb deletion, we predict that the removal of the exons 2 and 3 will probably not cause any frame-shift mutation of the gene product. The deletionbearing allele will probably encode a recep tor that is simply 82 amino acids shorter  R A P I D SCREENING OF D E L E T I O N S I N L D L RECEPTOR GENE227  than the normal one, in which the junction amino acid is changed from the normal valine (Exons 1-2) to the abnormal alanine (Exons 1-4). A previous study conducted by Van Driel et al. (1987), in which oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to remove specifically exon 2 of the LDL receptor gene, showed that the removal of exon 2 did not affect the binding of the LDL receptor to LDL nor the maturation of the receptor. However, another study by Leitersdorf et al. (1988) showed that a naturally occurring in-frame deletion of 6 bp, which removes only two amino acids in exon 2, caused a severe delay of the maturation of the receptor. It is, therefore, of great interest to know whether this new naturally occurring deletion of exons 2 and 3 has any major effect on the binding and/or maturation of the receptor. This study is currently in progress. The use of the random-primed probe-labeling technique reduces the time required for preparing a probe to as little as 40 min, and provides probes with consistently high specific activity. All enzymes used in this study are readily available within a reasonable price range. The 650 bp probe covers a larger region of the LDL receptor gene than the probe used by Hobbs et al., permitting the identification of the new 5 kb deletion in a subset of our patients. The 10 kb and 5 kb deletions in the LDLreceptor gene affect about 65% of FH heterozygotes in the French Canadian population. A simple screening technique is presented here, which can be readily used in molecular genetics laboratories for identification of deletion camers early in life, so that preventive procedures can be implemented long before complications develop.

"1","Am. J. Hum. Genet. 43:182-187, 1988  A DNA Test for Indiana/Swiss Hereditary Amyloidosis (FAP 11) Margaret R. Wallace,* P. Michael Conneally,* and Merrill D. Benson* tjt Departments of *Medical Genetics and tMedicine, Indiana University School of Medicine; and tRichard L. Roudebush Veterans' Administration Medical Center, Indianapolis  Summary Autosomal dominant amyloidosis of the Indiana/Swiss type is a late-onset disorder characterized by carpal tunnel syndrome, progressive peripheral neuropathy, vitreous deposits, and cardiomyopathy. This disorder was originally described in a large Indiana family of Swiss descent and is also known as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) type II. In the Indiana family, the genetic basis of the disease is a variant of plasma prealbumin (transthyretin), which has a serine-for-isoleucine substitution at amino acid 84 of the 127-residue prealbumin molecule. We predicted that the corresponding mutation in the prealbumin gene consisted of a T-to-G change in codon 84 (which created an AlMI recognition site) and then demonstrated the extra Alul site in the DNA of patients by Southern blot analysis with a genomic prealbumin probe. This verifies the protein findings at the DNA level and provides a direct, reliable DNA test for the Ser-84 prealbumin gene associated with Indiana/Swiss hereditary amyloidosis. Introduction  All amyloidosis syndromes are characterized by the extracellular deposition of fibrillar, proteinaceous material called amyloid (Cohen and Connors 1987). As these deposits accumulate they interfere with the functioning of surrounding tissues, resulting in illness. Many clinically distinct forms of autosomal dominant systemic amyloidosis have been reported throughout the world, with all sharing adult onset as a common feature (Andrade et al. 1970). Peripheral neuropathy is also a finding in most of the hereditary forms, which accounts for the disease's alternate name, "familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy" (FAP). The most widespread form, FAP I, has been reported in families of Portuguese, Swedish, Japanese, Greek, and English descent (Andrade 1952; Araki et al. 1968; Andersson 1970; Benson and Cohen 1977; Kincaid et al. 1984; Saraiva et al. 1986). Other FAP kindreds with somewhat different syndromes have Received January 25, 1988; revision received March 14, 1988. Address for correspondence and reprints: Merrill D.

The subject of the present study is an Indiana family of Swiss descent with arn amyloidosis syndrome that has been labeled FAP II. In this family, clinical findings (beginning between the ages of 30 and 50 years) include carpal tunnel syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, vitreous opacities, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and cardiomyopathy (Rukavina et al. 1956). Most patients die 10-20 years after disease onset, owing to heart failure or associated complications.  Recently, several single-amino-acid variants of prealbumin (a plasma transport protein produced in liver and choroid plexus) have been identified as the major amyloid subunit proteins in patients with autosomal dominant amyloidosis (see table 1). Prealbumin circulates as a tetramer composed of four identical subunits, each a beta-structured molecule containing 127 amino acids (Blake et al. 1978). The tetramer's two known functions are the binding and  DNA Test for Hereditary Amyloidosis  183  Table I DNA Tests for Prealbumin Variants in Hereditary Amyloidosis  Variant  Clinical Syndrome  Methionine 30 ..............

The human prealbumin gene encodes the 127-residue subunit and has a unique locus on the long arm of chromosome 18 (Wallace et al. 1985; Sparkes et al. 1987). The finding of prealbumin variants in families with hereditary amyloidosis has led to the hypothesis that the disease is caused by the gradual destruction of normal tissue by amyloid formed from the variant prealbumin molecules. Thus, the prealbumin gene is considered to be the hereditary amyloidosis gene in these kindreds, with the disease genes differing from normal only by the mutations that encode the amino acid substitutions (Shimada et al. 1986). Four DNA mutations deduced from identified protein substitutions have been verified by Southern blot analysis, by virtue of the fact that these mutations create specific restriction-enzyme sites (Sasaki et al. 1984; Wallace et al. 1986, 1988; Jacobson et al. 1987). Since hereditary amyloidosis has adult onset, direct DNA tests are of great importance in providing preclinical detection of gene carriers. The prealbumin variant (Ser-84) in the Indiana family contains a serine at position 84 in place of the normal isoleucine (Dwulet and Benson 1986). We report both development of a DNA test for the Ser84 mutation and application of this test in the Indiana family. Material and Methods  High-molecular-weight genomic DNA was extracted from venous blood leukocytes by the method of Madisen et al. (1987). For two affected members of the Indiana family who died before this study, DNA was extracted from frozen tissues (liver and spleen) according to a method described by Kunkel et al. (1977).  Southern blot analyses were performed as follows: Ten-microgram genomic DNA samples were digested to completion with AluI (Bethesda Research Laboratories) and subjected to horizontal electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel. The DNA was denatured and transferred to nitrocellulose (Southern 1975). After transfer the nitrocellulose filter was baked and prehybridized for 4 h at 65 C in the following solution: 6 x SSC (0.9 M NaCI and 0.09 M Na citrate, pH 7.0), 2% SDS, 1 x Denhardt's solution (0.02% ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% BSA fraction V), and 100 ,g sheared salmonsperm DNA/ml. A genomic probe was isolated from a 4.7-kb/HindIII prealbumin gene insert in lambda Ch21A by cleaving the insert with SphI. This gave a 775-bp SphIIHindIII fragment which includes the 3' end of exon 3 and part of intron 3. The 775-bp prealbumin genomic probe fragment (Wallace et al. 1987) was radiolabeled by the random-primer method (Feinberg and Vogelstein 1983) and the probe (105 cpm/ng) was hybridized to filters for 48 h at 65 C in fresh prehybridization solution (probe concentration 20 ng/ml). The filter was washed and autoradiographed, with the final wash (65 C) containing 0.2 x SSC and 1% SDS. Results On the basis of the prealbumin gene sequence  (Sasaki et al. 1985), the DNA mutation corresponding to the Ser-84 protein substitution was predicted to be a T-to-G change in codon 84 (fig. 1). This mutation creates an AluI recognition site, shown underlined in figure 1, and therefore presents a method for direct detection of the Ser-84 mutation from patient DNA by Southern blot analysis. Figure 2 shows a schematic map of the prealbumin gene and the region involved in the mutation.

The normal and variant gene sequences of the codon 84 region are given. The only single nucleotide difference that would result in a serine at position 84 in the protein is a T-to-G change in the second base of codon 84 (indicated by arrow). The palindromic AMuI site, coincidentally created by the mutation, is underlined.  84 is at the 3' end of exon 3. Initial Southern analyses using a full-length prealbumin cDNA probe failed to show a difference between Alul-digested DNA from normals and that from affected individuals (data not shown). Therefore, a 775-bp prealbumin genomic fragment (fig. 2) which was expected to detect an 880-bp fragment from the normal prealbumin gene and a 790-bp fragment from the variant Ser-84 gene was chosen as probe. Southern analysis with the genomic probe successfully identified the additional AluI site and thus the mutation.

Lanes 3,4, and 8 contain DNA from nonaffected individuals and show only the normal fragment, as expected. The results also show that the patients are heterozygous for the Ser-84 mutation, a finding that is consistent with an autosomal dominant disease. A total of 50 Indiana family members were tested for the Ser-84 gene. All nine clinically affected individuals in the study showed the Ser-84 gene while eight spouses (negative controls) showed only the normal pattern. Thirteen of 24 at-risk individuals under the age of 40 years (all of whom were asymptomatic) had positive Ser-84 DNA tests. Nine additional at-risk members over age 40 years had normal DNA tests. All Ser-84 gene carriers were heterozygous for the mutation. These DNA results agree completely with prealbumin protein analysis of a number of family members, affected and at risk, with the Ser84 gene found only in those individuals in whom the Ser-84 protein had been identified (Dwulet and Benson 1986). A 1983 study of the Indiana family found that all patients and approximately one-half of at-risk relatives had significantly low serum RBP levels, and it was suggested that a low RBP level might be indicative of the FAP II gene (Benson and Dwulet 1983). When DNA results were compared with RBP levels in Indiana family members, the Ser-84 gene was found only in those 21 individuals having decreased RBP levels, with one exception: one showed the Ser84 gene but had a normal RBP level; however, this person also had renal failure (serum creatinine 4.0 mg/dl), which can result in elevated RBP levels.  DNA Test for Hereditary Amyloidosis Discussion  Since 1983 a total of five prt.albumin variants other than Ser-84 have beej2 identified, all in association with hereditary amyloidosis. These variants and corresponding syndromes are listed in table 1. The variant found in FAP I has a methionine in place of valine at position 30 (Met-30) (Dwulet and Benson 1983). The Met-30 variant is most commonly associated with an amyloidosis syndrome that includes lowerlimb neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, and renal failure. Two other variants have also been found in families with similar symptoms. These are the Ile-33 variant, found in one Israeli family (Nakazato et al. 1984), and the Tyr-77 variant, which was identified in one American/German family (Wallace et al. 1988). In addition to its identification in a large Appalachian kindred (Wallace et al. 1986; Benson et al. 1987), the Ala-60 variant has been found in several other U.S. families with hereditary amyloidosis (unpublished data). The syndrome in the Ala-60 families features severe cardiomyopathy with mild peripheral and autonomic neuropathy, and it generally has very late onset (50s or 60s or later). The Danish hereditary amyloidosis also features severe cardiac involvement (Frederiksen et al. 1962), and initial reports indicate that the variant has a methionine at position 111 (Met-111) (Husby and Sletten 1986; K. Sletten, personal communication). In addition to these, a number of kindreds remain to be characterized at the biochemical or DNA level, and some of these families have syndromes that are unique. It is apparent that many substitutions in the prealbumin molecule can cause the subunit to be amyloidogenic. However, the mechanisms behind the late onset or the specificity of the amyloid for certain tissues are unknown. A fair amount of clinical variation is seen between and even among prealbumin variants, which indicates that other factors are contributing to the expression of the disease. The DNA patterns in the Indiana family agree perfectly with the predicted Ser-84 gene mutation and the prealbumin gene map. The variant 790-bp fragment results from the additional AluI site in the normal 880-bp fragment that is created by the Ser-84 mutation. This verifies the protein findings and provides a method for detection of Ser-84 gene carriers. The Ser-84 DNA test is the fifth such test for hereditary amyloidosis genes. Of the variants described above, the Met-30, Ile-33, Ala-60, and Tyr-77 genes can also be directly identified by straightforward  185  Southern analysis using specific restriction enzymes, which are listed in table 1. However, the Tyr-77 and Ser-84 DNA tests have the additional requirement for genomic rather than cDNA probes. In the Ser-84 case, as is evident from figure 2, the cDNA is unable to hybridize to the 790bp fragment (under normal conditions) because it contains only 25 bp of exon 3 sequence. Our initial Southern analyses using the cDNA probe showed a reduction in the intensity of the 880-bp band in gene carriers, as expected, but the 790-bp fragment was never evident, possibly being masked by comigrating prealbumin sequences. Thus, we chose to develop the test using the genomic probe to avoid those problems and make interpretation clear. The choice of genomic probe was limited by the need to avoid detection of comigrating sequences and also by the close proximity of an Alu highy repetitive DNA sequence to exon 3. In addition to AMuI, three other enzymes theoretically could have been used to detect the Ser-84 gene in a Southern analysis. The T-to-G mutation creates sites for BbvI and Fnu4HI while eliminating an SfaNI  site. However BbvI and SfaNI were considered to be prohibitively expensive, while Fnu4HI is impractical because it cuts several times within exon 3, with the fragments of interest thus being too small to resolve and detect with the standard Southern analysis procedure. Fortunately, the AluI fragments are of reasonable size and the variant fragment can be easily separated from the normal one in a short 1.5% agarose gel. The DNA results were used to test the 1983 hypothesis that a low serum RBP level is a marker for the FAP II gene (Benson and Dwulet 1983). When compared with RBP concentrations for individuals in the Indiana family, there was almost perfect correlation between a positive Ser-84 DNA test and low RBP level. The only exception was one amyloidosis patient. However, we feel that this normal rather than low RBP level is due to his renal failure, since free RBP (not bound to prealbumin) is excreted by functioning kidneys. Thus, the DNA results show the direct relationship between the mutant protein and low RBP levels. Consistent with this finding is the preliminary evidence that the Ser-84 prealbumin has a greatly reduced affinity for RBP (Helvie et al. 1986). On the basis of the data from the DNA tests, it appears that a low RBP level can be considered to be an accurate indicator of the Ser-84 (FAP II) gene, excluding con-  Wallace et al.  186  ditions such as renal failure which might lead to falsenegative or positive results. This plasma protein test is, of course, only applicable to adults and not to prenatal diagnosis. Although as yet unknown secondary factors play a role in modifying expression of hereditary amyloidosis, the development of DNA tests for the primary factors (the prealbumin variants) is an important step in defining the incidence and diversity of the hereditary amyloidoses. DNA testing is also important for genetic counseling by offering a means of carrier detection that is direct and accurate. While carrier detection can be accomplished by protein chemistry (using prealbumin purified from plasma), only DNA testing is applicable to prenatal diagnosis. The Ser-84 gene test is one of five direct DNA tests for hereditary amyloidosis, with all five tests being based on the presence of mutations that create restriction-enzyme recognition sites. This may not be possible for prealbumin variants that have not yet been characterized. Theoretically the mutation predicted for the Met-111 variant deletes a DdeI site in exon 4, but it is possible that technical difficulties may be encountered that render such a test impossible. In such cases, or when a mutation fails to create or delete an enzyme site, it may be possible to develop a DNA test using an oligonucleotide probe, as has been done for other disorders such as beta thalassemia (Orkin et al. 1983). It seems likely that additional prealbumin variants will be found that are associated with hereditary amyloidosis, and it is possible that prealbumin alleles may also exist that are not associated with amyloid formation. DNA testing will be valuable in categorizing new amyloidosis families, in establishing connections between families, and also as a tool for genetic counseling.

This disorder was originally described in a large Indiana family of Swiss descent and is also known as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) type II. In the Indiana family, the genetic basis of the disease is a variant of plasma prealbumin (transthyretin), which has a serine-for-isoleucine substitution at amino acid 84 of the 127-residue prealbumin molecule. We predicted that the corresponding mutation in the prealbumin gene consisted of a T-to-G change in codon 84 (which created an AluI recognition site) and then demonstrated the extra AluI site in the DNA of patients by Southern blot analysis with a genomic prealbumin probe. This verifies the protein findings at the DNA level and provides a direct, reliable DNA test for the Ser-84 prealbumin gene associated with Indiana/Swiss hereditary amyloidosis."
"1","We here describe a mutant low density lipoprotein receptor gene that produces a shortened receptor protein lacking three domains: the region of clustered O-linked carbohydrates, the membrane-spanning region, and the cytoplasmic tail. The defect is attributable to a single nucleotide substitution that creates a premature termination codon at amino acid 660, eliminating 180 residues from the mature protein. The truncated protein retains only two domains: a complete ligand-binding region (residues 1-292) and a partial epidermal growth factor precursor homology region (residues 293-659). The termination codon occurs in the middle of a cysteine-rich sequence that is part of the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain. The mutant protein is present in markedly reduced amounts and may be translated at a reduced rate. After synthesis, most of the receptor remains within the cell for several hours with its N-linked carbohydrate in an unprocessed endoglycosidase H-sensitive form. This finding suggests that the shortened receptor leaves the endoplasmic reticulum at an abnormally slow rate, which is likely attributable to abnormal folding of the truncated protein. The mutation creates a new restriction site for the enzyme HinfI, thus permitting diagnosis by Southern blotting of genomic DNA. Two copies of this mutant gene were present in each of four unrelated Arab patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (three from Lebanon and one from Syria). We believe that this mutation, hereafter referred to as the "Lebanese allele," is responsible for the extraordinarily high incidence of familial hypercholesterolemia in Lebanon.Vol. 262, No . 1, Issue of January 5,pp. 401-410, 1987 Printed in U.S.A.

Clinical Data-Five subjects (FH 264,550,786,793, and 787) have the classical clinical syndrome of dominantly inherited homozygous FH. FH 264 (female), FH 550 (female), and FH 786 (male) are from three different Lebanese families. FH 793 (female) is Syrian. Cells from all four of these subjects produce a 100-kDa LDL receptor precursor that is not processed. FH 787 (male) is a French Canadian who is a compound heterozygote; his cells produce both a 120-kDa unprocessed form of the LDL receptor and a 160-kDaprocessed form. FH 265 (male) is a Lebanese with a variant form of familial hypercholesterolemia. He is one of four affected siblings in the Kh family described by Khachadurian (19) and Khachadurian and Uthman (20). The variant form of hypercholesterolemia is distinguished from classic FH in the following three ways: 1) autosomal recessive inheritance (the heterozygous parents in the Kh family have normal total plasma cholesterol levels); 2) lower total plasma cholesterol levels in affected homozygotes (the four affected siblings in the Kh family have values of 414-470 mg/dl versus 600-1000 mg/dl in classic FH homozygotes); and 3) a lower population frequency (of 30families with severe hypercholesterolemia in Lebanon, only 1 had the variant form and theother 29 had classic FH) (19,20). Assays of LDL Metabolism and Monoclonal IgG-C7Binding-Human fibroblasts were obtained from skin biopsy specimens and grown in monolayer culture a t 37 "C in a 5% CO, incubator. About 3.5 X lo' cells from stock cultures were seeded into 60-mm Petri dishes according to a standard protocol and cultured for 5 days. Maximal synthesis of LDL receptors was induced by incubation in human lipoprotein-deficient serum for 48 h prior to study, as described elsewhere (16). We then measured the binding, internalization, and degradation of '=I-LDL a t 37 'C (16) and thecell surface binding of monoclonal anti-receptor 1261-IgG-C7a t 4 'C (18). Immunochemical Analysis of 13SS/Methionin~-lobeled LDL Receptors-Monolayers of fibroblasts were incubated with [36S]methionine in methionine-free Dulbecco'smodified Eagle's medium supplementedwith 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum as indicated in the figure legends. After labeling, the cells were washed twice with 2 ml of ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (GIBCO 310-4190) and then lysed by addition of0.2 ml of buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl,, 2.5 mMMgC12, 1 mM unlabeled methionine, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM leupeptin, and 1.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. The dishes were scraped with a rubber policeman, and thecell extract was centrifuged at 4 "C for 30 min a t 150,000 X g. The supernatant was precipitated with preformed immune complexes consisting of monoclonal mouse antiLDL receptor IgG-C7 or IgG-2001 and goat anti-mouse IgG as described previously (21). If not indicated otherwise, the immunoprecipitates were dissolved by heating a t 90 "C for 3 min in buffer containing63 mM Tris-C1 (pH 6.8), 2.3% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 150 mM dithiothreitol and thensubjected to electrophoresis on 6.5% or 7% SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels (14 X 8.5 X 0.15 cm), followed by treatment with EN3HANCE, drying, and autoradiography (21).

Exons 7-14 encode a sequence of 400 amino acids of unknown function that is homologous to a sequence in theprecursor for epidermal growth factor. Exon 15 encodes a sequence of 58 amino acids that contains 18 serine and threonine residues, to most of which are attached short carbohydrate chains in 0-linkage (13, 14). This is the so-called clustered 0-linked sugar region (15). Exon 16 and part of exon 17 encode a hydrophobic sequence that spans themembrane. The remainder of exon 17 and exon 18encode a COOHterminal sequence of 50 amino acids that projects into the cytoplasm and directs the receptor to coated pits. The calculated molecular weight of the protein component of the LDL receptor (minus the signal sequence) is 93,102. When the receptor is synthesized, it migrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels with an anomalous molecular weight of 120,000, a property that is partly attributable to the presence of N-acetylgalactosamine residues on the clustered serine and threonine residues encoded by exon 15 (14, 15). After the newly synthesized receptor is transported to the Golgi complex, its apparent molecular weight shows afurther anomalous increase to 160,000, primarily owing to theelongation of the clustered 0-linked sugar chains by the addition of galactose and sialic acid residues (14). In addition to the clustered 0-linked sugars, the receptor contains a few 0-linked sugar chains as well as two to three N linked carbohydrate chains scattered on the NH2-terminal portion of the protein (15).These latterforms of carbohydrate contribute relatively little to the anomalous electrophoretic behavior of the receptor. When the clustered 0-linked sugar region encoded by exon 15 is artificially deleted from the cDNA, the transfected receptor loses most of its anomalous behavior on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (15). In the current study, we report the molecular basis of a prevalent mutation that causes FH in the Lebanese population. This "Lebanese allele" produces a receptor that migrates with an abnormally smallapparent molecular weight of 100,000. The defect is attributableto a single base substitution in exon 14 that produces a premature termination codon. The truncated receptor lacks the region encoded by exon 15 and therefore lacks clustered 0-linked sugars. The receptor also lacks a membrane-spanning region and a cytoplasmic tail. Evidence for a similar defect was found in four individuals, three from different families in Lebanon and one from Syria. We believe that thisnonsense mutation accountsfor the high frequency of FH in Lebanon.  403  Mutant LDL Receptor Retained in Endoplasmic Reticulum (16 h, 14 "C) with 490 units of T 4 DNA ligase. The ligated material was packaged into X phage particles in vitro to yield a total of 1.9 X lo6 plaque-forming units, and one recombinant clone was identified with an exon Wspecific probe. This clone, designated XFH 264-22, was isolated after two additional cycles of plaque purification. The human DNA insert was subcloned into BamHl-digested pBR322. A restriction map of the insert was in agreement with that of the corresponding segment of the normal gene (5). DNA Sequencing-The sequence of exon 14 in XFH 264-22 was obtained as follows. An oligonucleotide primer specific for the 5' end was 5' end-laof exon 14 (5'-GAGTGAACTGGTGTGAGAGG-3') beled with [Y-~'P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. A doublestranded plasmid derived from pBR322 and containing the cloned insert of XFH 264-22 was denatured with 0.4 N sodium hydroxide and then annealed with the 32P-labeled primer. The primer-template complex was subjected to one of two procedures: 1) it was extended in the presence of appropriate dideoxynucleotide mixtures (without c~-~'P-labeled deoxynucleotides) and the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and sequenced by a modification of the method of Sanger et al. (26); or 2) i t was extended in the presence of 1 mM deoxynucleotides and the Klenow fragment, digested with Sphl, and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to yield a 119-nucleotide extension product, which was sequenced by the method of Maxam and Gilbert (27). The sequence of the normal exon 14 (4, 5) was generated for direct comparison with the sequence of exon 14 from FH 264 by the above methods using plasmid p381-20 (28), which contained a 17-kb BamHI fragment of the normal gene extending from intron 10 to exon 18. Southern Blotting-High molecular weight genomic DNA (5 pg) was isolated from cultured fibroblasts (6), digested with a 12-fold excess of HinfI, and subjected to electrophoresis for 14 h at 1.2 V cm" in 5% NuSieve-agarose (FMC Corp.) with buffer containing 45 mM Tris acetate, 2 mM trisodium EDTA, 10 mM sodium acetate, and 9 mM NaCl at pH8.2. The gel was then treated by shaking a t room temperature with 0.5 M NaOH and 1.5 M NaCl for 60 min, followed by 5 X buffer A (1 X buffer A = 50 mM Tris acetate and 1 mM trisodium EDTA at pH8.2) for 40 min, followed by 1 X buffer A for 30 min.

The FH 264 cells showed no detectable high affinity binding, uptake, or degradation of lz5I-LDL. Table I shows that cells from three other individuals from different Arab families (FH 550 and 786 from Lebanon and FH 793 from Syria) also show a marked reduction in high affinity binding, uptake, and degradationof lz5I-LDL.Intact cells from FH 264 and FH 550 also failed to bind '251-labeledIgG-C7 at 4 "C, a monoclonal antibody directed against the LDL receptor, indicating that no immunoreactive receptor reached the surface of these cells (Table 11). As shown in Fig. 2, after a 2-h incubation with [35S]methionine and precipitation with IgG-C7, normal fibroblasts exhibited two forms of the LDL receptor on SDS-polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis: 1)the precursor form with an apparent molecular weight of 120,000, and 2) the mature form with an apparent molecular weight of 160,000 (Fig.2, Lane A ) . When the cells were chased with unlabeled methionine for 2 h, all of the precursor was converted to the mature form (Fig. 2, Lane B ) . In contrast, the FH 264 cells produced only a 100kDa precursor (Fig. 2, Lane C), which was not converted to a higher molecular weight even after a 2-h chase with unlabeled methionine (Fig. 2, Lane D).The amount of labeled receptor in the FH 264 cells was much less than that in the normal  TABLE I Metabolism of ''=I-LDLat 37 "C by monolayers of fibroblastsfrom FH homozygotes After incubation for 48 h in lipoprotein-deficient serum (day 7 of cell growth), each monolayer received 2 mlof medium containing 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum and 10 fig of protein/ml of "3-LDL (140-200 cpm/ng of protein) in the absence or presence of 500 pg of protein of unlabeled LDL.

For comparative purposes, in the same experiment, we studied fibroblasts from a Canadian FH homozygote (FH 787) whose cellscontain the 120-kDaprecursor form of the receptor and the160-kDa form (Fig. 4, Lane 5 ) . The 120-kDa band, which isthe same size as  Mutant LDL Receptor Retained in Endoplasmic Reticulum  405  the normal precursor, migrated more slowlythan the100-kDa form present in the Syrian subjects. To compare the carbohydrates on the normal and mutant forms of the receptor, we pulse-labeled normal cells with [35S] methionine for 1 h so that theprecursor and mature forms of the receptor would both be labeled (Fig. 5A). We labeled the FH 264 cells for 2handthen incubated the cells for 2 additional h in the presence of unlabeled methionine so as to obtain the 100-kDa receptor in its most mature form (Fig. 5B).We treated the immunoprecipitates either with neuraminidase or with endo H prior to electrophoresis. In normal cells, neuraminidase decreased the apparent molecular mass of the 160-kDa mature receptor (Fig. 5, Lane 2), but it did not affect the 120-kDaprecursor. In contrast, endo H did not 30 affect the mature form of the receptor, but it did reduce the apparent molecular mass of the 120-kDa precursor ( L a n e 4). In the FH264 cells, neuraminidase had no effect on the 100kDa form of the receptor ( L a n e 7), but endo H reduced its apparent molecular mass ( L a n e 9). Thus, 2 h after its synthesis, the 100-kDa protein appeared to possess unprocessed high-mannose, endo H-sensitive N-linked sugars, but not mature sialylated oligosaccharides. To determine whether the 100-kDa receptor in the Lebanese homozygote cells contains clustered 0-linked N-acetylgalactosamine residues, we incubated normal and FH 264 5 IO 15 cells with [3H]glucosamine,isolated the receptor by immuFRACTION noprecipitation, and digested the protein with Pronase.

N-linked oligosaccharides adhere tothe concanavalin ASepharose column, but the 0-linked sugars do not. Since there is much more N-acetylgalactosamine (0-linked) than N-acetylglucosamine (N-linked) in the LDL receptor precursor, the bulk of the radioactivity does not adhere to theconcanavalin A column (Fig. 6C and Ref. 14). A strikingly different distribution of radioactivity was observed in the FH 264 cells. In these cells, mostof the radioactivity adhered to the concanavalin A column and was eluted only with a-methylmannoside (Fig. 6A, solid circles). Verylittle LDL receptor-specificradioactivity appeared in the run-through fractions, indicating that little N-a~etyl[~H]galactosamine was incorporated into 0linked sugars (Fig. 6A). To control for nonspecific immunoprecipitation in the FH 264 cells, we performed the same digestion and column chromatography on a corresponding fragment of a polyacrylamide gel to which we had applied a labeled extract that was im-  Mutant LDL Receptor Retained in Endoplasmic Reticulum  406  munoprecipitated with an irrelevant monoclonal antibody (Fig. 6A, open circles). Fig. 6B shows the difference between the radioactivity obtained from the specific and nonspecific immunoprecipitates in each of the column fractions. Even after this correction was made, a small amount of specifically precipitated radioactivity from the FH264 cells was found in the void volume fractions in Fig. 6B. We believe that this radioactivity represents the small number of scattered 0linked carbohydrate chains that are known to be attached to the LDL receptor in regions outside of the cluster encoded by exon 15 (Ref. 15). Thus, the dataof Fig. 6 are consistentwith the hypothesis that the FH264 receptor lacked all clustered 0-linked carbohydrates. To determine whether the shortened LDL receptor of FH 264 cells contains a normal COOH terminus, we incubated cells for 4 h with [35S]methionineand then precipitated the receptors with either of two antibodies, one directed against the NH2-terminalregion of the receptor and the other directed against the COOH-terminal14 amino acids (Fig. 7). In normal cells, the receptor was precipitated with the anti-NH2-terminal antibody (Lane A) and the antibody directed against the COOH-terminal sequence (Lane B). The receptor produced in FH 264 cells was precipitated by the anti-NH2-terminal antibody (Lane C), but it was not precipitated by the antiCOOH-terminal antibody (Lane D). The reduced size, lack of clustered 0-linked sugars, and absence of reactivity with the anti-COOH-terminal antibody suggested that the FH264 receptor might terminate prior to the region encoded by exon 15. To determine whether this termination resulted from a gross deletion in the FH 264 gene, we studied the size of the mRNA encoded by this allele. As shown in Fig. 8, the size of the LDL receptor mRNA produced by the FH 264 cells was indistinguishable from normal after denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Moreover, extensive analysis of the FH 264 receptor gene by Southern blotting with cDNA probes specific for exons 1-18 of the receptor indicated an absence of any large deletions or rearrangements (data not shown). These findings raised the possibility that the shortened receptor protein in the FH 264 cells was the  T 9 x  r’  F  146-  97-  Anti-COOH  ‘ -  28s-  23s  18SGrowth Conditions  ]Sterols  1-1+1-1  FIG. 8.

To test this hypothesis, we turned to genomiccloning. Exons 11-17 (and part of exon 18) of the LDL receptor are contained on a 17-kb BarnHI fragment (Fig. 9). We digested genomic DNA from patient FH 264 with BarnHI, size-fractionated the fragments to isolate those with a size in the range of 17 kb, and ligated these DNAs into a bacteriophage X cloning vector. A recombinant bacteriophage containing the receptor fragment was isolated, and the DNA insert was subcloned into pBR322 and subjected to sequencing by primer extension on denatured double-stranded DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). The sequence of the extended primer was determined by the chemical method of Maxam and Gilbert (27) and by the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger et al. (26). Both methods gave the same result: the FH 264 gene contained a cytidine to adenine transversion in  Mutant LDL Receptor Retained in Endoplasmic Reticulum codon 660 of the mature receptor, changing the codon from TGC (cysteine) to TGA (termination). The sequencing gel autoradiogram showing this result obtained by the Sanger technique is presented in Fig. 10.

Genomic DNA was digested with HinfI, subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis,and blotted onto Zeta-probe membranes, which efficiently retain small fragments of DNA. The blots were probed with a 32P-labeledcDNA fragment corresponding to exon 14. DNA from five normal subjects (two of whom are shown in Fig. 1lA)showed a HinfI band of -286 base pairs. In thethree Lebanese patients and theone Syrian patient described above (FH 264,550,786, and 793), a smaller HinfI fragment of -210 base pairs was seen (Fig. 1lA). This is the predicted size of the fragment if the abnormal HinfI site were present in thegene (Fig. 11B). Moreover, the absence of the normal 286-base pair fragment indicates that all four individuals are true homozygotes. DNA from the Lebanese patient (FH 265) with the variant form of hypercholesterolemia (see “Experimental Procedures”) showed onlythe normal Hinff band (Fig. 1lA). This result is consistent with the biochemical phenotype of these cells, which shows a mature receptor that migrates with an apparent molecular weight of 160,000on SDS gels (data not shown). The premature termination codon in the FH264 cells would beexpected to produce a receptor that terminates in the middle of a 40-amino acid cysteine-rich sequence designated repeat C (Fig. 12). Such an alteration is likely to disrupt the disulfide-bondingpattern of the receptor in this region. Previous studies have suggested that the vast majority of the cysteine residues in the LDL receptor are disulfide-bonded (29). To demonstrate this phenomenon formally, we purified the LDL receptor from bovine adrenal cortex using a previously described procedure (30). The receptor was denatured in 7 M guanidine and then incubated in an excess of [3H] iodoacetic acid with or without prior reduction with P-mercaptoethanol (Table 111). Following the reaction, the receptor was dialyzed and theamount of incorporated 3H radioactivity was measured. In the absence of P-mercaptoethanol, very little [3H]iodoacetic acid was incorporated (approximately0.2 mol/mol of receptor). In the presence of P-mercaptoethanol, 85 mol of [3H]iodoaceticacid was incorporated per molof receptor. If the amino acidsequence of the bovineLDL receptor is the same as that of the human (4) or the rabbit (9), we would have expected 62-63 mol of [3H]iodoacetic acid incorporated per molof fully reduced receptor. The value observed in Table I11 (85 mol/mol) is close to the expected value if one allows for the experimental error of the protein determination used to estimate the amount of pure receptor. The dataindicate that very few, ifany, of the cysteine residues of the LDL receptor are accessible to [3H]iodoaceticacid in the absence of prior reduction, presumably because they are disulfide-bonded. If free cysteine residues do exist, they are presumably buried within the receptor structure where they are inaccessible to [3H]iodoacetic acid, even in the presence of a strong denaturant. DISCUSSION  In this paper, we describe a nonsense mutation at codon 660 in the LDL receptor gene. The mutation was found in three Lebanese subjects and one Syrian subject, all from different families. Each of the individuals had the classic syndrome of homozygous FH, andeach appeared to have two copies of the same mutant gene. As shown in Fig. 12, the nonsense mutation would be expected to give rise to a protein of 659 amino acids that lacks the region containing clustered 0-linked carbohydrates, the membrane-spanning region, and the cytoplasmic tail. Biochemical studies confirmed that the receptor produced by the mutant cells is smaller than normal  408  Mutant LDL Receptor Retained in Endoplasmic Reticulum NORMAL  I  Ligand Binding  FIG. 12.

It is conceivable that the premature termination codon maylead to a reduced cytoplasmic concentration of the mutant mRNA as hasbeen shown for a similar type of mutation in a @-thalassemiagene (31). Alternatively, the stop codon could affect the translational efficiency of the mutant RNA, perhaps owing to a kinetic delay in releasing the truncated nascent chain from the ribosome or in translocating the mutant polypeptide chain across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The magnitude of the reduced expression seems too great to be attributed to rapid degradation of the mutant protein. As shown in Fig. 2, at least half of the ['H]Iodoacetic receptors produced during a 2-h pulse were intact after a 2-h 8-Mercaptoethanol acid incorporated" chase.

Indeed, we performed multiple experiments in which the FH 264 cells and the FH 550 cells were labeled with [36S]methionine for periods ranging up to 24 h, after which the culture medium was subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies known to precipitate the FH 264 and FH 550 receptors. No immunoprecipitable receptor was observed in the culture medium. These experiments were performed under conditions in which we have previously demonstrated secretion of LDL receptors in a cell line that expresses an LDL receptor gene that lacks the exons encoding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (6). Instead of being secreted, the FH 264 receptor seemed to undergo degradation with ahalf-life of about 2 h (data not shown). We do not know why the FH264 receptor was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum for a prolonged period, but a clue may lie in the site of the premature termination (Fig. 12). The termination codon occurs in themidst of a 40-amino acid cysteine-rich sequence that has been designated as repeat C. This sequence is at the COOH-terminal end of a 400-amino acid sequence that is held in common by the LDL receptor and the epidermal growth factor precursor (32). Within this 400-residue sequence, the 40-amino acid cysteine-rich sequence is repeated three times (32). The first two repeats (A and B)occur at theNH2-terminal endof the 400-amino acid sequence, and the finalrepeat ( C ) occurs at the COOHterminal end. Eachof the repeats is encoded by a single exon; the C repeat is encoded by exon 14. Each of the repeats contains 6 cysteine residues. Biochemical evidence suggests that these cysteine residues are all involved in intrachain disulfide bonds (Table 111); and it is likely that all of the bonds form within repeats rather than between repeats, a finding that has been documented for other proteins with similar cysteine-richsequences, e.g. the blood-clotting factors (33). The abnormal termination codon occurs at theposition of the third cysteine of the C repeat (Fig. 12). It seems likely that the 2 remaining cysteine residues would no longer be able to engage in normaldisulfide bond formation. This would leave unpaired cysteine residues near the COOH terminus, which might lie at the surface of the protein. The existence of such exposed free sulfhydryls might be sufficient to block the movement of the receptor out of the endoplasmic reticulum. We have previously observed two other mutations in which the LDL receptor fails to move to theGolgi complex(9). Both of these involve small in-frame deletions in another cysteinerich region, i.e. the NH2-terminal 292 amino acids that constitute theligand-binding domain. These mutations were also postulated to distort the normal pattern of disulfide bond formation, therebyleading to theexistence of unpaired sulfhydryls. It is possible that unpaired sulfhydryls in some way interfere with the movement of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum tothe Golgicomplex. Such hindrance maybe mediated by gatekeeper proteins that bind these sulfhydryls and stop themovement of abnormal proteins to the surface. As originally suggested by Gething et al. (34), the purpose of such a system might be to prevent the immune system from being exposed to denatured proteins that might trigger abnormal immune responses. Further studies are now planned to testwhether the presence of unpaired cysteine residues in the truncated C repeat is responsible for the failure of the LDL receptor in the FH 264 cells to leave the endoplasmic reticulum a t a normal rate. From the data currently available, it would seem that the nonsense mutation at codon 660 is responsible for the high incidence of FH in Lebanon. This mutation accounts for all  Reticulum  409  eight alleles at the LDL receptor locus in the four unrelated homozygotes with classic FH from Lebanon and Syria that we have studied. Presumably, the high frequency of this mutation is attributableto a founder effect. In addition to the classic form of familial hypercholesterolemia in Lebanon, there is also a rare variant form (19, 20). In DNA from one such rare variant,we found a normal HinfI digestion pattern. Thus, these rare variantsmust have a different mutation. The ability to distinguish the Lebanese allele on the basis of a HinfI digest of genomic DNAshould allow us to determine whether all cases of classic FH in Lebanon and neighboring Arab countries stem from the same mutation. If this is the case, then it should be possible to develop a rapid method of diagnosis employing Southern blotting. Acknowledgments-We thank Drs.

The disease occurs either sporadically or inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Autosomal dominant inheritance is rare. We report a large family with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance. Sixteen members were affected with a disease characterized by proximal weakness, leg greater than arm, onset in the third decade, elevated CK and CK MB levels, and myopathic EMGs and muscle biopsies. Linkage analysis revealed no conclusive linkage. NEUROLOGY 1988;385-9  T h e nomenclature of neuromuscular diseases has evolved as our diagnostic sophistication has increased, and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) has been profoundly affected, albeit in a corollary fashion.'P2 Various syndromes have been separated from t h e LGMD classification, and, while the residual LGMD patients are less phenotypically diverse, they remain heterogeneous. We have discerned a large, multigeneration kindred with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance of LGMD, which affords a unique opportunity as the same gene defect should be responsible for the disease in all affected members of the family. In this report, we detail our findings in this family as regards clinical characteristics, EMG, muscle patholgy, and linkage analysis. Materials and methods. Clinical studies. The diagnosis of LGMD was based on weakness, tendon contractures, absent deep tendon reflexes (DTRs), dysarthria, and elevated CK or CK MB isoenzyme levels (table 1). CK analysis was done on all family members. The upper limit of normal for males was 120 IU/l and for females 80 IU/l. All values were divided by the relevant upper limit to get a relative level of CK (relative CK). A value greater than 1.5 was considered abnormal. CK isoenzyme fractionation by agarose electrophoresis was also done on each sample. A percentage of MB was obtained, which when multiplied by the CK value gave an absolute amount of MB, abnormal being greater than 5 units. MB values should be zero in normal individuals. Informed consent approved by the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board was obtained on all subjects prior to acquiring any blood specimens.  Linkage studies. Linkage analysis was done using 13 red cell and serum polymorphisms (ABO,RH, MNS, JK, KELL, FY, P, ACP1, HP, PGM1, ESD, GC, and BF). All markers were informative for this family with the exception of the KELL locus. Lod scores were calculated using the program LIPED assuming LGMD in this family is an autosomaldominant trait with age-dependent penetrance. Using the method outlined by Pericak-Vance et al,3we estimated the mean and variance of age of onset based on the pedigreedata. Criteria for diagnosis for linkage were the presence of clinical abnormalities (as in table 1)and an elevated CK and/or CK MB level. Equal recombination was assumed for males and females (8, = 8, [e = recombination fraction]).  Results. Clinical studies. The family is located primarily in southeastern West Virginia. T h e known pedi-  gree spans seven generations in which members of five generations are still living (figure). The pedigree includes 144 persons of which 115 are alive and 61 of these have been examined. Sixteen members are known to be affected; another eight are suspected but remain unexamined. Analysis of critical matings in which all offspring were examined revealed that 18 (47%) of 38 were affected (including dead, obligate carriers). The clinical signs found in t h e 16 affected members are listed in table 1 and are compared to t h e examined normal family members. There was proximal weakness of the legs in 13 individuals and of the arms in 11. None had arm weakness without leg weakness a n d leg weakness preceded arm involvement in all, often by several years.

Three individuals, all women, one the eldest living member of the family and an obligate carrier, had only dysarthria, tightened heel-cords, and absent ankle jerks. All 16 affected members had absent ankle jerks and 10 had tight heel-cords (the ankles could not be dorsiflexed past 90’). No unaffected member had either. Knee and arm DTRs were absent in none, but were decreased in five affected individuals. Facial weakness was seen in three affected individuals. Age of onset ranged from 18to 35 years of age with a mean of 24.8 and a variance of 3.85 years3 Two patients were wheelchair-bound, this occurring in both approximately 20 Table 1.

CK levels were elevated in 15 of the 16 affected individuals and ranged from 1.6 to 9 times normal. The sole affected member with a normal CK was the weakest, a 45-year-old man with quadriplegia. Fifteen affected members had CK isoenzyme analysis and 13were found to have elevated amounts of the MB fraction. The affected man with a normal CK had an abnormal level of CK MB. The two affected persons with normal CK MB levels both had abnormal CK levels. Either CK, CK MB, or both were elevated in all 16 affected persons. CK, relative CK, CK MB, and percentage of MB inversely correlated with current age and years since onset 0,< 0.01). Ambulatory function was also inversely correlated with CK, CK MB, relative CK, and years since onset of symptoms. Only three unaffected members had an elevation of CK, all three being below the mean age of onset (8, 15, and 22 years of age). One of the three (the 15-year-old) was the only unaffected individual to have abnormal levels of CK MB. None of the three had abnormalities on physical examination and two were the children of affected persons. The third child (the 8-year-old)had an unaffected mother but an affected grandmother. EMG results were available in eight family members, all affected. All were indicative of a primary myopathic process with small, brief, complex motor units seen in eight patients, easily recruited to a full interference pattern in six of the patients. Two persons had a decreased interference pattern secondary to the late stage of disease. Abnormal spontaneous activity, consisting of fibrillations and positive waves, was seen in seven of eight studies. Electrical myotonia was not seen in any study.

The highest lod score (2) was obtained with HP at emax = 0.15 with 2 = 0.85. H P is mapped to chromosome 16 at q22.1.  Discussion. We have presented a large family with a hereditary disease with the following characteristics: (1) autosomal dominant inheritance; (2) proximal greater than distal weakness; (3) leg weakness preceding arm weakness; (4) absent ankle DTRs and frequent heel-cord contractures; ( 5 ) onset in the third decade of life; (6) elevated CK and/or CK MB; and (7) myopathic EMG and muscle biopsy. Other dominantly inherited muscular dystrophies are easily excluded: facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy because of the lack of primary arm weakness and scapular winging; myotonic dystrophy because of the lack of clinical or electrical myotonia; and humeroperoneal dystrophy6 because of the lack of neck and elbow contractures and because of different distributions of weakness. The diagnosis of LGMD in our family was initially based solely on the presence of weakness, particularly proximal weakness. Disease expression was not limited to this, however, as clearly weak individuals also had dysarthria, heel-cord contractures, and facial weakness. In addition, one obligate carrier had disease limited to dysarthria, heel-cord contractures, and absent ankle DTRs. Therefore, the diagnostic criteria were expanded Jlnupry 1988 NEUROLOGY 38 7  such that weakness was not the sole prerequisite. assess linkage with five red blood cell markers as well as CK and/or CK MB was elevated in all affected family color vision, ability to taste phenylthiourea, and the members and was a very useful diagnostic tool.

Patients with Schneiderman et alZowas noted also to have an unusual LGMD are frequently not diagnosed till late in the anomaly of leukocytes called Pelger-Huet.

We found evaluate independently a polymorphic marker system for linkage. The use of a single large family for linkage three young family members with elevated CK but no analysis will circumvent the problem of genetic heterodisease.

We report here the first identification of a molecular lesion in the aldolase B gene of an affected individual whose defective protein has previously been characterized. The mutation is a G--*C transversion in exon 5 that creates a new recognition site for the restriction enzyme Ahall and results in an amino acid substitution (Ala~Pro) at position 149 of the protein within a region critical for substrate binding. Utilizing this novel restriction site and the polymerase chain reaction, the patient was shown to be homozygous for the mutation. Three other HFI patients from pedigrees unrelated to this individual were found to have the same mutation: two were homozygous and one was heterozygous. We suggest that this genetic lesion is a prevailing cause of hereditary fructose intolerance. Introduction  Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by abdominal pare, vomtting, and hypoglycaemia following the ingestion of fructose or related sugars (Chambers and Pratt, 1956; Gttzelmann et al., 1983). In infants at weaning, the condition may be severe and cause fatal liver dysfunction (Odtevre et al., 1978), but it responds dramattcally to dietary exclusion. Although the inctdence of the dtsease in different populations is unknown, a survey in Switzerland esttmated a frequency of 1 in 20,000, and therefore a carher frequency of 1% (Gttzelmann and Baerlocher, 1973). The association of a catalytic defect in aldolase B with HFI has been well documented (Hers and Joassm, 1961). Aldolase B (EC.4.1.2.13) catalyzes the cleavage of fructose-l-phosphate to form dlhydroxyacetone phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde (Hers and Kusaka, 1953) The enzyme is expressed exclustvely tn the liver, kidney, and intestine--tissues that actively assimdate fructose. AIdolase B ts thus functionally distinct from the homologous isozymes, aldolases A and C, which are abundant in muscle and nervous tissue, respectively, and which have a greater activity wtth respect to fructose 1,6-diphosphate (Penhoet and Rutter, 1971).  Hereditary fructose intolerance is genettcally heterogeneous (Gitzelmann et al., 1974; Gregori et al., 1982; Cox et al., 1983a), but immunologically detectable ~ldolase B has been found in biopsy samples of all affected tissues examined thus far (Nordmann et al., 1968; Gregori et al., 1982). In several studies, the apparent concentratton of cross-reacting material (crm +) was markedly reduced, and a regulatory defect of tissue-specific expression has been proposed (Gregon et al., 1982). However, immunotitration studies in patients with diminished apparent crm + tn liver and intestine demonstrated the presence of abundant bssue aldolase B with reduced specific activity and impatred recognition by polyclonal anttbodies (Cox et al., 1983b). Thus naturally occurring mutations in crm ÷ patients alter regtons of the aldolase B protein that are critical for functional actiwty, but they may also induce major structural changes that lead to impaired antibody recognitton. Precise characterization of such genetic defects should help to define crttical regions of the enzyme and clarify the relattonship between aldolase structure and its function. The aldolase B gene has been mapped to human chromosome 9 and sequenced (Tolan and Penhoet, 1986). It consists of nine exons, the first of which is untranslated. The cognate mRNA encodes 364 amino acids and there are three independent reports of its sequence (Rottman et al., 1984; Sakakibara et al., 1985; Paolella et al., 1984). Previously, molecular defects of aldolase B in hereditary fructose intolerance have not been identified. Here, we report the sequence analysis of the aldolase B genes of a patient tn whom the mutant protein has been characterized wtth respect to enzymattc activity, immunological reactwity, and subunit structure (Cox et al., 1982; Cox et al., 1983b). Results and Discussion Cloning and Sequencing of a Mutant Aldolase B Gene A genomlc library was constructed from leucocyte DNA prepared from an HFI patient who has been described previously and studied (Cox et al., 1982, Cox et al., 1983b). Six clones, containing exons 3-9 on a 9 kb BamHI fragment, were recovered. The complete sequence of the coding regtons from one of these clones was determined and a single base pair change was f o u n d - a G-->C transversion at codon 149 (Figure 1). The mutatton causes a proline residue to be substituted for an alanine at this position and hence is designated A149R Exon 2 from the same patient was cloned directly into a plasmid after specific amplification of that exon by the polymerase chain reactton (PCR) (Satki et al., 1985). Five independent clones were sequenced and found to be normal. The splicing signals for all the introns, comprising the 5'GT/3'AG splice sttes and the intron sequences containing the lariat branch point signal within 50 bp of the 3' sphce stte, were determined. These sequences were iden* tical to the w~ld type with the exception of a deleted C resi-  Cell 882  Wild type  HFI  306 -G---~  183-123--  C.--ID...  1 T  C  G  A  #  145  146  147  148  149  150  151  152  Gly  Lys  Trp  Arg  Ala  Val  Leu  Arg  Codon  T  C  G  A  Wdd Type GGGiAAG TGG CGT GCT GTG CTG AGG HFI  Pro  CCT  Figure 1 Identificattonof a MissenseMutation in the HumanAldolase B Gene The gene sequencewas obtamedfrom an mdwidualaffected by HFI A singlediscrepancywasfound betweenthe mutantand wild-typecodmg sequences,a G~C transversionresultingin the replacementof an alanine by prohneat posit=on149, thus designatedA149P The lesion generatesa new recognitions~tefor the restncttonenzyme Ahall.  due 16 bp upstream of the start of exon 8. This is the first base of the polypyrimidine tract that precedes the 3' splice site and is too far downstream to disrupt the lariat branch point signal found between - 3 7 and -18 (Reed and Mamatis, 1985). Indeed, the only candtdate sequence (GACTAAT, see consensus PyXPyTPuAPy) lies between positions - 3 5 and - 2 9 in this intron. The deleted C cannot cause activation Of a cryptic 3' splice site since the use of alternative AG sttes within the intron would generate a truncated product due to stop codons in the retained intron sequence. Activation of the first in frame AG within exon 8 would produce a protein 11 amino acids shorter, with altered charge and incompatible with the mutant aldolase B in this patient, which has a slightly increased apparent subunit size without a change in charge (Cox et al., 1983b).  Detection of the A149P Mutation by Direct Analysis of Amplified Genomic DNA The A149P mutation creates a new recognition site for the restriction enzyme Ahall (GPuCGPyC). However, this enzyme and its isoschizomers were found to cut leucocyte DNA very poorly even when used in large excess, and detection of the mutation by Southern blotting of genomic DNA was not undertaken. Thts may be due to methylatlon of genes not actively expressed m white cells. Cloned DNA was efficiently cleaved by Ahall, and all six HFI clones were found to contain the A149P mutation (data not shown), suggestmg that the mdividual was homozygous. To confirm this, exon 5 sequences were specifically amplified from genomic DNA of this patient by the PCR and  2  3  4  5  Ftgure 2 GenotypeAnalysts of Patientswtth HFI Lane 1: healthy individual; lanes 2-5: HFI patients.

The amplified 306 bp fragment was cleaved completely by the restriction enzyme to give products of 183 bp and 123 bp, thus demonstrating the presence of the mutation in both alleles of the gene (Figure 2, lane 5). As expected, exons 5 from normal individuals were not digested by Ahall (Figure 2, lane 1). An identical analysis was carried out on three HFI individuals unrelated to the patient above. Two of them, a brother and sister, were also found to be homozygous for the A149P mutation (Figure 2, lanes 2 and 3). The third patient was heterozygous (Figure 2, lane 4). Thts latter patient is therefore a compound heterozygote, and the amphfied exon 5 fragment that was not cut by Ahall represents and originated from a different mutant allele. This corroborates the prevtous study of the mutant enzyme in this patient in which the aldolase differed structurally from that of the HFI individual first shown to be homozygous for the A149P mutation. Nonetheless, the phenotypic manifestations of disease in these two patients are clinically indistinguishable (Cox et al., 1982; Cox et al., 1983a).  Segregation of the A149 Allele in an Affected Pedigree To demonstrate segregation of the A149P alleles, genomic DNA was isolated from five members of a pedigree affected by HFI and was analyzed by digestion with Ahall after PCR amplification. The family includes the two affected individuals shown to be homozygous for the A149P allele (Figure 2, lanes 2 and 3; Figure 3, lanes 3 and 4). As predicted by the autosomal recessive transmission of the disorder, both unaffected parents carry one wild-type and one mutant allele (Figure 3, lanes 1 and 2). Their asymptomatic daughter was found to be a heterozygous carrier of the disease (Figure 3, lane 5). These data show that inheritance of two alleles bearing this mutation is associated with expression of the disease in this kindred. Our findings indicate that homozygosity for the A149P allele is directly responsible for the HFI phenotype in several apparently unrelated patients.

In addition, this lesion was found in other unrelated individuals with HFI and segregated with the disease m an affected pedigree as a recessive Mendelian character.  Implications of the A149P Mutation for Catalytic Function Aldolase isozyme cDNA clones have been sequenced from diverse species and show considerable homology. It is notable that the a m i n o acid residue at position 149 (the site of the mutation shown here) is specific for aldolase B (Figure 4). In the human, rat, and chicken e n z y m e this is  Human B  ,I,  146  147  148  149  150  151  Lys  Trp  Arg  ~-~  Val  Leu  AAI~a a  Rat B  Lys  Trp  Arg  Chicken B  Lys  Trp  Arg  Val  Leu  Val  Leu  Human A  Lys  Trp  Arg  Cys  Val  Leu  Rabbit A  Lys  Trp  Arg  Cys  Val  Leu  Human C  Lys  Trp  Arg  Cys  Val  Leu  Mouse C  Lys  Trp  Arg  Cys  Val  Leu  Figure 4 Comparison of Aldolase Protein Sequences Surrounding the Site of the Mutation Described Here (posrtton 149 marked by an arrow) This residue ts an alamne ~naldolase B but cysteme tn aldolases A and C and thus may be involved in aldolase B-specific catalysts. The sequences were obtained from the following publications human B (Rottmann et al., 1984); rat B (Tsutsumt et al, 1985), chcken B (Burgess and Penhoet, 1985), human A (Izzo et al., 1987), rabbit A (Tolan et al, 1984); human C (Rottmann et al, 1987), mouse C (Paolella et al, 1986).  an alanine, but aldolases A and C possess a cysteine at this position. The residue may therefore be involved in aldolase B-specific catalysis. The insertion of a prohne residue, an imino acid in which peptide bond formation involves the rigid pyrollidone ring, is known to alter protein s e c o n d a r y structure. Moreover, vicinal residues (Lys 146 and Arg 148) are implicated in the binding of substrate (Hartman and Brown, 1976; Patthy et al., 1979) and have been shown by X-ray crystallography of muscle aldolase to be located on the ~ strand of a binding pocket (Sygusch et al., 1987). Thus mutation resulting in the c h a n g e of Ala 149 to proline is likely to disrupt the spatial configuration of juxtaposed restdues in aldolase B and adversely affect its catalytic properties. That this mutation drastically modifies e n z y m e structure is shown by the markedly reduced i m m u n o r e a c t w i t y of the protein and by tts altered electrophoretic mobility wtthout c h a n g e in charge (Cox et al., 1983b). Carrier Detection and Diagnosis of Fructose Intolerance The A149P mutation has been found in five out of the six HFI alleles studied. This implies that the methods employed here may facilitate carrier detection and diagnosis =n families affected by the disease. Further work is needed to ascertain the true prevalence of th~s mutation. We suggest that the selection pressure against HFI was probably minimal before sugars b e c a m e widely available wtth the advent of the industrial revolution. Mutations in aldolase B may have been able to accumulate by genetic drift and it =s therefore possible that a limited n u m b e r of mutant alleles may account for the great majority of individuals affected by fructose intolerance. Experimental Procedures Cloning of a Mutant Aldolase B Gene Genomtc DNA obtained from peripheral leucocytes of an HFI patient was dtgested to complehon wtth BamHI and slze-fractionated on an agarose gel. An aldolase B-enriched fraction of approximately 9 kb (Tolan and Penhoet, 1986) was recovered by the freeze-squeezetechnlque (Tautz and Renz, 1983) and hgated to XL47 arms (Loenen and Brammar, 1980). Packaging extracts were prepared and the reactions performed as described (Scherer et al, 1981). A sequence in intron 6 of aldolase B has previously been found to be unclonable rn rec A stratus of E coh (Tolan and Penhoet, 1986), presumably because =t contains a long palindrome or homopolymer tract (Leach and Stahl, 1983, Nader et al, 1986) This problem was obviated by plating the library on a rec BC sbcB host (Leach and Stahl, 1983). Six aldolase B clones, containing exens 3-9 on a 9 kb BamHI fragment, were retrieved by probing w~th the cDNA clone pilL413 (Rottmann et aL, 1984) Exon 2 was cloned directly from genom=cDNA after spectfic amplification of that exon by the polymerase chain reachon (PCR, see below) DNA Sequence Analysis Fragments of one phage clone, designated XEE13, were subcloned into pEMBL 18 or 19 (Dente et al., 1983) and sequenced by the chain terminator method (Sanger et al., 1977) using either the M13 universal primer (New England Btolabs) or specific ohgonucleottde primers derived from the genomtc sequence (Tolan and Penhoet, 1986) and synthesized on a Cyclone DNA synthesizer (Btosearch, Inc.). DNA Amplification The polymerase chain reaction was performed as follows: 1 p.g genomtc DNA was dispersed in 100 #1 PCR reaction buffer (50 mM  Cell 884  KCI, 2 mM MgCI2, 10 mM Iris (pH 8.3), 0.1% gelatin, 0.2 mM each PCR primers, 0.2 mM dATE 0 2 rnM dTTP, 0.2 mM dCTP, 0.2 mM dGTP) in 0.5 ml mtcrofuge tubes. The DNA was denatured by heating to 95°C for 7 min. The samples were transferred to a water bath (45°C) for 5 min to allow annealing of the pnmers. One unit of Taq polymerase (Anghan Biotechnology Ltd ) was added, and the reaction mixes were overlaid with 50 p.I mineral oil (Sigma). The tubes were transferred to a 70°C water bath for 3 rain to allow primer extension, denatured to 91°C for 2 rain, and reannealed at 45°C for 2 rain This cycle was repeated 30 times with the addition of a further unit of Taq polymerase after every 10 cycles. Aliquots of the reactions were analyzed on 2% mm~gels: usually 200 ng-1 p.g of the desired fragment was produced Occasionally, however, add,tlonal spurious bands were also found, usually of very small size. In these cases the correct fragment was excised from the gel and recovered The primers used for amplification were" 5'GTTGTTATATGATGAGACTG3' and 5'GAGCCACCCATGGTTCTGTG3' for exon 2, which produced a 201 bp fragment, and 5'CCATGGATCAGGTACAAAGG3' and 5'GGTCCATTTGTAGTTATAGT3' for exon 5, which produced a 306 bp fragment. Detection of A149P Allele AldoSase B exon 5 was specifically amplified by the PCR from genomlc DNA obtained from HFI patients and normal controls The 306 bp fragment was digested with Ahall (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's recommendat=ons The mutant A149P allele =scleaved to produce bands of 183 bp and 123 bp.

"1","The frequency and inheritance of three restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene were investigated in 27 South African families with familial hypercholesterolaemia. Four haplotypes, defined by the enzymes PvuII, StuI, and NcoI, were found to segregate in this population. The frequency of the rare allele detected by NcoI was found to be 0.53 in 45 unrelated familial hypercholesterolaemic (FH) patients compared to 0.33 in 60 normal controls (p less than 0.005). In 71% of the families studied, a haplotype with common alleles for PvuII and StuI and the rare allele for NcoI cosegregated with the defective gene. In 20% of the families, a second haplotype with rare alleles for PvuII and StuI and common allele for NcoI segregated with FH.

The frequency and inheritance of three restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene were investigated in 27 South African families with familial hypercholesterolaemia. Four haplotypes, defined by the enzymes PvuII, Stul, and NcoI, were found to segregate in this population. The frequency of the rare allele detected by NcoI was found to be 0-53 in 45 unrelated familial hypercholesterolaemic (FH) patients compared to 0-33 in 60 normal controls (p<0.005). In 71% of the families studied, a haplotype with common alleles for PvuII and Stul and the rare allele for NcoI cosegregated with the defective gene.

In these families the haplotypes unambiguously cosegregate with the disease and can therefore be used for early diagnosis of FH. SUMMARY  Mutations in the human gene for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors produce the clinical syndrome of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH).1 These receptors are located in coated pits on the cell surface, bind plasma LDL, and carry it into cells by receptor mediated endocytosis. In patients with FH, the genetically defective receptors cause LDL to accumulate to high levels in plasma, which eventually leads to atherosclerosis. At least 10 different mutant alleles at the LDL receptor locus can be distinguished through biochemical studies of cultured fibroblasts from FH patients.2 A cDNA clone for the human LDL receptor gene has recently been isolated,3 which enables one to study these receptor defects at DNA level. DNA restriction site polymorphisms (RFLPs) around or within structural genes allow identification of alleles, which can be used to study the association with a disease within a population, or segregation of marker alleles and disease within a family. Received for publication 6 February 1987. Accepted for publication 16 March 1987.  750  Previous studies have shown that a PvuII restriction enzyme polymorphism of the LDL receptor gene can be used to show that alleles of this genetic marker coinherit with familial hypercholesterol*4  aemia.  We have previously reported two new RFLPs at the LDL receptor gene locus.5 6 Both the restriction enzymes Stul and NcoI identify two allele polymorphisms which are informative for family studies and early diagnosis of FH. In this study we report the frequency of the three LDL receptor gene restriction site polymorphisms in the normocholesterolaemic and FH populations. A study of haplotype associations with FH in 27 informative families show a predominant association of two haplotypes with the disease.  Subjects and methods Blood samples were collected from 45 selected FH patients attending the lipid clinic at Tygerberg Hospital, Tygerberg, South Africa. Pedigree analyses were performed on 27 of these patients and  Haplotype associations of three DNA polymorphisms blood samples were collected from 292 of the family members. The patients were selected as having FH when the following criteria were fulfilled. Total serum cholesterol levels of all patients had to be at least equal to the 90th centile for their age and sex categories of a typical South African white population. If patients received cholesterol lowering drugs (cholestyramine, probucol, bezafibrate, or nicotinic acid) in full dose, singly or in combination, they were included in the FH study group only if their total cholesterol level was at least equal to the 70th centile for the age and sex group. All FH study participants had normal serum triglyceride levels equal to or lower than 2*0 mmol/l. In addition, a FH study participant had to have either clinical features of FH (tendon xanthoma of the Achilles tendon or tendons on the dorsum of the hand with or without xanthelasma) or a family history of early coronary heart disease (CHD). An early CHD family history was defined as being present when the FH participant reported that at least two first or second degree relatives suffered CHD before the age of 50 years. Blood samples from 60 normocholesterolaemic, Afrikaans speaking, white subjects were obtained from the laboratory population and from unaffected spouses of subjects with FH. Total serum cholesterol levels of the normocholesterolaemic study group were not higher than the 50th centile for their age and sex categories of a typical white South African population.7 Their serum triglyceride levels were also normal (2 mmol/l). All the other criteria for FH were absent in this study group. LIPID DETERMINATION  The total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were measured on a Gilford auto-analyser using the Boehringer CHODPAP enzymatic method. HDL cholesterol was measured after precipitation of the apoprotein B containing lipoproteins with dextran sulphatemagnesium chloride. The triglyceride levels were determined by the Boehringer enzymatic Peridochrom method. In each case the Gilford autoanalyser was calibrated against Precilip or Precilip EL control sera, which were corrected by Boehringer Mannheim for the specific test kit in question. Two control samples were included in each batch analysed. DNA PREPARATION AND RFLP ANALYSIS  DNA was prepared from the blood samples by a Triton-X100 lysis method.8 Aliquots of the DNA (5 ig) were digested with the restriction enzymes PvuII, Stul, and NcoI, using conditions recommended by the suppliers (Boehringer Mannheim). DNA fragments were separated by size on a 0-6% agarose gel  751  and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schnell, BA85, 0.45 nm) by the Southern  blotting technique.9  The human DNA probe for the LDL receptor gene, pLDLR-2HH1, was obtained from Dr D W Russell of Dallas. It consists of a 1-9 kb fragment of the 3' end of the LDL receptor cDNA clone and subcloned into a BamHI site of the vector pSP64.3 The insert was excised with BamHI, separated from the vector on a 1% agarose gel, and recovered. The probe DNA was labelled in vitro by nick translation to a specific activity of 108 cpm/,ug (BRL Kit, Amersham International). Filters were prehybridised for three hours at 65°C in 3xSSC (1xSSC: 0*15 mol/l NaCl, 0-015 mol/l sodium citrate), 0*1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 10x Denhardt's solution, 50 ig/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA (Sigma), and 10 ig/ml poly A (Sigma). The probe was then added at a concentration of 50 ng/ml and hybridisations were carried out for 22 hours at 65°C. Filters were finally washed in 1 x SSC, 0-1% SDS and exposed to Kodak XAR film for one to three days. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  x2 tests were performed to document that the popu-  lations investigated were or were not in HardyWeinberg equilibrium and to compare the chromosomal frequencies. Results Table 1 shows the results of lipid analysis, the family history of early CHD, and presence of tendon xanthomas in 45 FH patients and 60 controls. Family history denotes the presence of a myocardial infarct or sudden death before the age of 50 years in first or second degree relatives.

The distribution of genotypes is close to the expected value if the population is in HardyWeinburg equilibrium, but a statistically significant increase in the rare allele of the NcoI polymorphism above the values in the normocholesterolaemic group was found in the FH population (x2= 17-2, p<0-005). This indicates population association of this allele with a gene predisposing to hypercholesterolaemia.

P2S2NI P2S2N2  lotypes of double heterozygotes were inferred from the pedigree. (There were 14 double heterozygotes in the normal population and two in the FH population for whom pedigree information was unavailable, so they are therefore not included.) Haplotypes for 43 unrelated FH (86 haplotypes) and 46 normocholesterolaemic subjects (92 haplotypes) are shown in table 4. The demonstration of only a few genotype and haplotype combinations in the populations can be interpreted as non-random association of the three DNA markers of the LDL receptor gene. One of the haplotypes, PISIN2, shows a significantly higher incidence in the FH group (32% in normocholesterolaemics compared with 54% in hypercholesterolaemics). The predominance of the N2 allele of the NcoI polymorphism in FH subjects is clear in tables 2 and 3.  We have used the PvuII, Stul, and NcoI polymorphisms to follow the inheritance of the LDL receptor gene in 27 informative families in which FH occurs. In 17 families (46 normal and 75 affected offspring) the PlSlN2 haplotype and the FH phenotype cosegregated. An example of one extended family is shown in fig 3a. The FH phenotype was associated with the P2S2N1 haplotype in seven informative families, where 38 normal and 46 affected offspring were analysed (example of one family in fig 3b). The PiSIN1 haplotype has shown association with the FH phenotype in two families (four normal and eight affected offspring) and the P2SlN1 haplotype in only one family (seven normal and eight affected offspring). Table 5 shows the frequencies of the different haplotypes associated with FH in 34 unrelated FH heterozygotes. The FH haplotypes were deduced from the pedigree analyses in the 27 families and from seven patients homozygous for all three RFLPs. In 71% of the FH families studied, the PlS1N2 haplotype cosegregates with the defective gene, while the P2S2N1 haplotype segregates in 20% of families. The PISINI and P2S1N1 haplotypes are associated with the FH phenotype in only 6% and 3% of families studied, respectively.

The association of the P1S1N2 and P2S2N1 haplotypes with FH in the white South African population were further confirmed in five clinical FH homozygotes. Four have shown P1P1S1S1N2N2 genotypes, while one is a heteroallelic genetic compound with a PlP2SlS2NlN2 genotype, containing both the P1S1N2 axid P2P2N1 haplotypes. The haplotypes were deduced from family studies. The haplotypes and lipid results of five FH homozygotes are shown in table 6.  Discussion The prevalence of FH in South Africa is unusually high and a 'founder gene' effect in the Afrikaner population has been proposed." LDL receptor studies of South African FH homozygotes have shown a predominance of a receptor defective type of abnormality.'2 In our study using three DNA polymorphisms at the human LDL receptor gene in 45 FH and 60  TABLE 6 Haplotypes and lipid results of five homozygous FH patients.

The PvuII, Stul, and Ncol RFLPs have been used to follow the inheritance of the LDL receptor gene in 27 informative FH families. In 71% of these the P1S1N2 haplotype cosegregated with the defective gene. This association was further confirmed in five FH homozygotes. Four were homozygous for the P1S1N2 haplotype and one a genetic compound with both the P1SlN2 and P2S2N1 haplotypes; in 20% of FH families studied the FH phenotype cosegregated with the P2S2N1 haplotype. The PlSlNl and P2S1N1 haplotypes have been associated with the FH phenotype in only 6% and 3% of families studied respectively. Studies are under way to confirm these rare FH haplotypes in clinical FR homozygotes. If, as expected for polymorphisms around a single gene, there is no recombination between the three RFLPs, it will be possible to combine the information on all three RFLPs to form an unequivocal haplotype for any subject. In the 27 families studied so far, we have observed no recombination within the DNA region of the LDL receptor gene covered by the three RFLPs. Analyses of associations of RFLPs have revealed only four of the possible eight haplotypes. This may be an indication that the PvuII, StuI, and NcoI RFLPs are non-randomly associated. Since the S2 allele is found only in association with the P2 allele, whereas the Si allele is found with both the P1 and P2 allele, it is likely that the PvuII polymorphism evolved before the StuI -olymorphism. The base pair changes creating the loss of a StuI site must have arisen on a chromosome 19 with a P2 genotype. Similarly we can postulate that the PvuII polymorphism has arisen in the presence of the Ni allele, since the N2 allele is never found in association with P2S1 or P2S2 genotypes. Haplotype analysis alone is not sufficient to distinguish normal from FH chromosomes, since the same haplotypes were found in both the normal and FH populations. This finding is interpreted as an indication that the LDL receptor gene haplotypes were established at a point in evolution before the mutations causing FH. It further implies that the FH mutations evolved independently from one another, suggesting that a particular mutation is likely to be associated with a specific haplotype. Variations at these three polymorphic sites may serve as valuable genetic markers, for the identification of different  755  FR mutations, for population studies, and as a basis for prenatal diagnosis of many FH mutations.

"1","Characterization of a Transthyretin (Prealbumin) Variant Associated with Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy Type 11 (Indiana/Swiss) Francis E. Dwulet and Merrill D. Benson Departments of Medicine and Biochemistry, Rheumatology Division, Indiana University Medical School, and Rheumatology Section, Richard L. Roudebush Veterans Administration Medical Center, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202  Abstract Amyloid fibrils were isolated from cardiac tissue of two brothers who died from familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) type II. Sequence analysis on peptides derived from proteolytic cleavage with trypsin and fragmentation with cyanogen bromide reveal that the fibril subunit protein is derived from plasma transthyretin (prealbumin). About two-thirds of the fibril subunit protein was found to contain an amino acid substitution at position 84 where the normal isoleucine residue has been replaced by serine. Sequence analysis of the plasma transthyretin (prealbumin) from the two brothers as well as two clinically diagnosed FAP type II family members and two of four children of affected individuals showed the presence of serine at position 84. The presence of this substitution also correlates with low serum levels of retinolbinding protein and thus transthyretin (prealbumin) position 84 may be involved with the interaction of these two proteins.  sified chemically (9). Pras et al. described a variant transthyretin (prealbumin) from the amyloid of a Jewish patient (10) and it is now known that at least one Swedish kindred (1 1, 12), two Japanese kindreds (13, 14), and the Portuguese patients with amyloidosis (15) all have a variant transthyretin (prealbumin) with a methionine substitution for valine at position 30 of the 127 amino acid residue transthyretin (prealbumin) molecule. Recently we found that affected individuals in the Indiana/ Swiss kindred have low serum levels of retinol-binding protein (RBP), whereas other kindreds do not (16). Since RBP binds to transthyretin (prealbumin) in the plasma, this led us to postulate that another transthyretin (prealbumin) variant is present in this condition. To investigate this we have isolated and structurally characterized the amyloid protein of the Indiana/Swiss type.  Methods  1. Abbreviations used in this paper: FAP, familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RBP, retinol-binding protein.  Amyloid-laden tissue was obtained postmortem from two brothers who died of cardiac insufficiency and who had been diagnosed as having FAP type II. Amyloid fibrils were isolated from 30-g samples of heart tissue by the procedure of Pras et al. ( 17). The fibril subunit protein was then isolated from fibril concentrates by denaturation, reduction, alkylation, and size exclusion chromatography as previously described (12). The subunit protein (4 mg) was digested with trypsin and the peptides separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a column (1 X 25 cm) of Synchrom RP-8 resin. When necessary, peptides were repurified on Altex Ultrasphere C-18 or Waters bondapakphenyl columns. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was done as previously described (1 1). The amyloid subunit protein and plasma transthyretin (prealbumin) were cleaved with cyanogen bromide as reported previously (18). To 2 mg of amyloid subunit protein was added 0.5 ml of deoxygenated 70% formic acid and 2 mg of cyanogen bromide. The mixture was stirred in the dark at room temperature for 24 h and then dried under vacuum. The peptides were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 50% acetic acid and separated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a column (1 X 25 cm) of Synchrom RP-P resin using a 2-propanol gradient (0-56% during 90 min) to elute the peptides. All protein and peptide samples were degraded in an 890C liquidphase sequenator (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA) using the 0.1 M Quadrol buffer program. 3 mg of polybrene was added to each sample to reduce extractive losses. Amino acid analyses were performed on a 1 19C instrument (Beckman Instruments, Inc.). All samples were hydrolyzed under vacuum for 24 h at 1 15°C using 5.7 N double-distilled HCO that contained 2 mg of phenol to reduce oxidation. Plasma transthyretin (prealbumin) was isolated using a three-step procedure involving DEAE Sephadex ion exchange chromatography, Affigel Blue dye ligand affinity chromatography, and size exclusion chromatography as has been reported previously (18). After denaturation in 70% formic acid the protein was digested with trypsin and the peptides separated by reverse-phase HPLC as for the amyloid subunit protein (19).  J. Clin.

Both  Introduction In 1956 Rukavina et al. (1) reported a large kindred of Swiss descent with hereditary amyloidosis who had settled in northeastern Indiana. At the time the clinical features of this malady were distinctive from the familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP)1 in Portuguese families that was described by Andrade (2). The Indiana/Swiss type of amyloidosis was characterized by early onset of the carpal tunnel syndrome followed by a more generalized peripheral neuropathy, blindness from vitreous deposits of amyloid, and cardiomyopathy. Unlike the Portuguese FAP, clinically significant renal involvement was absent. While a number of other kindreds with amyloidosis have been described in the last 30 years (Japanese, Swedish, Danish, Iowa, German, French) (3-8), the Indiana/Swiss syndrome has remained clinically distinct. Only the Maryland kindred described by Mahloudji, which also has a high incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome, clinically resembles the Indiana syndrome (7). With the discovery that amyloid fibrils in the autosomal dominant amyloidoses were composed of transthyretin (prealbumin), it became obvious that these amyloidoses might be clasAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Dr. Benson, Chief, Rheumatology Section, Richard L.

Both fractions were highly enriched for amyloid fibrils as demonstrated by Congo red staining. After denaturation, reduction, and alkylation, the fibril subunit protein was isolated by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1). On sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE, peak IV was found to have molecular mass of 14,000 D and to be size homogeneous. Reverse-phase HPLC also revealed a single major protein peak. The other fractions were found to be heterogeneous by the above criteria. From 200 mg of starting fibril material 14 mg of peak IV was isolated, and it accounted for -20% of the solubilized isolated proteins. Sequence analysis of peak IV material revealed a heterogeneous structure from which the parent molecule could not easily be identified. The cyanogen bromide fragmented material gave an HPLC profile that was indiscernible from non-FAP type I transthyretins (prealbumins). Sequence analysis of the major cyanogen bromide peptide provided a sequence that was identical to that from positions 14-52 of normal plasma transthyretin (prealbumin). Tryptic digestion of peak IV material generated a peptide mixture that gave the reverse-phase HPLC profile seen in Fig. 2. In general, peptides were isolated in 90% or greater purity. Amino acid composition and sequence analysis revealed that these peptides were derived from plasma transthyretin (prealbumin): the only primary structure difference was that peptide TlO' (residues 81-103) was found to have a serine instead of the normal isoleucine at position 84 (Table I). The amino terminal peptide started predominately from transthyretin (prealbumin) position 5, but longer and shorter peptides were also present. Finally, for a preparation from one of the brothers, peptide 7-8 (residues 49-76) appeared to have both a glycine and the normal threonine at position 49. The two small peaks after peptides 10' and 10 had amino acid compositions and sequence analysis consistent with their being derived from 10' and 10 with arginine 104 attached to the carboxyl terminal.

Peaks are numbered to correspond to the tryptic peptides as noted in Fig. 3.  quenator yield data for all major peptides are shown in Table II while the alignment of all peptides are shown in Fig. 3. Tryptic peptide HPLC maps for FAP type II and normal plasma transthyretin (prealbumin) can be seen in Fig. 4. These profiles are identical except that the FAP type II protein has peak 10'. By sequence analysis this peak contains residues 81103 of the transthyretin (prealbumin) molecule with a replacement at position 84 of a serine for the normal isoleucine.  Discussion While large amounts of amyloid fibrils were isolated from the cardiac tissue, there was a low recovery of fibrils in the water supernatant, which is comparable with that seen for FAP type I tissue samples (1 1). To obtain the best yields of the subunit protein, solubilization in 8 M guanidine required 48-72 h to dissociate the fibril subunit proteins from the matrix proteins. Sequence analysis of peak IV material revealed a multiple sequence. Review of these data after further studies on the tryptic peptides revealed that this fraction was composed of transthyretin (prealbumin) and that -40% of the material being sequenced started at position 5 of the transthyretin (prealbumin) molecule with an additional 20-30% starting at positions 4 and 6. The cyanogen bromide digest was done on two samples of the amyloid subunit protein. The first cleavage was performed using subunit protein obtained from the top-layer material. Sequence analysis of the major cyanogen bromide polypeptide gave the same amino acid residues as the starting material, which indicates that little or no cleavage had occurred. However, when the cyanogen bromide digest was performed on the subunit protein isolated from the water wash material, the major peptide isolated by HPLC gave a single sequence starting at position 14 of the transthyretin (prealbumin) molecule. This sequence was extended to position 52 with no differences from normal transthyretin (prealbumin) (Table II). The tryptic digest of the subunit protein from one of the brothers gave the profile seen in Fig. 2. There are only a few differences in this profile from that of normal transthyretin (prealbumin).

This is most likely due to the facts that it is truncated and has a heterogeneous amino terminal. Second, peptide T2 (residues 10-15) was isolated in poor yields with limited recovery of carboxymethyl cysteine and methionine on amino acid analysis. Also, peptides T5-6 (residues 35-48) and T6 (residues 36-48) were isolated in very low yields (the small unlabeled peaks at 42 and 45 min, Fig. 2) and of insufficient purity for reliable sequence analysis. These findings are consistent with the cysteine 10, methionine 13, and tryptophane 41 all being partially or completely oxidized in the fibrils. That the subunit protein from top-layer fibril material did not show significant cleavage with cyanogen bromide is also consistent with oxidation of the methionine 13. This is in contrast to FAP type I fibrils, which show no such oxidation. This difference may be due to the tissue in which the fibrils are deposited. In most FAP type I preparations the fibrils are isolated from kidney, while in FAP type II the fibrils are isolated from the heart. Since the heart is a very oxygen-rich organ it is possible that long-term exposure to these levels of oxygen leads to oxidation of these sensitive residues. Coupled to this it can be proposed that those fibrils found in the water wash are more recently formed and have not yet been oxidized or tightly entangled in the cellular matrix. The peptide for residues 81-103 was found in two peaks (TI0 and T10'). Peptide TI0 had the normal sequence while peptide TlIV had the same sequence but at position 84 the normal isoleucine had been replaced by a serine. Lastly, in one of the samples the peak for peptide T7-8 (residues 49-76) had a clearly observable shoulder, and on compositional analysis showed an extra half-residue of glycine. Upon sequence analysis both glycine and threonine were seen at the amino terminus of this peptide (position 49), while all other residues were the same as normal. If this were a real amino acid replacement it would represent a double substitution. This is of interest because it was initially reported that a Jewish hereditary amyloid also had a glycine at position 49 (10). Sequence analysis of amyloid subunit protein 884  F. E. Dwulet and M. D.

All peptides are numbered sequentially from the amino terminus. The sequence information obtained from each peptide is represented by an arrow under the appropriate sequence.  from the second brother with FAP type II revealed no glycine at position 49. This, coupled to the fact that the cyanogen bromide sequence data only showed threonine at position 49, has led us to believe that the glycine is not part of the polypeptide backbone but instead is the result of a chemical linkage of a residue of glycine to an amino acid side chain (probably serine, threonine, or lysine). In an attempt to confirm if the glycine residue is part of the primary structure or is attached to the prealbumin molecule either before or after its incorporation into the fibrils, we isolated transthyretin (prealbumin) from the plasma of the two deceased brothers, two clinically proven affected family members, and four children of clinically affected individuals as well as ofnormal individuals. For all individuals the yield ofisolated transthyretin (prealbumin) was 35-45% of theoretical, which is the range we have seen for this method (18). Because of the high stability of transthyretin (prealbumin) it is necessary to denature the protein before trypsin digestion. For these proteins we used the method of Nakazato et al. with incubation in 70% formic acid at room temperature for 18 h (19). We found this method acceptable, but only 20-40% of the molecules were fragmented with trypsin in this manner. To ascertain that neither the normal or variant protein was preferentially cleaved by trypsin, the undigested proteins from preparations of two affected individuals were redigested with trypsin. HPLC peptide profiles of these materials showed essentially complete cleavage and did not differ significantly from the first trypsin-digested material. The pattern for the two deceased brothers and two affected family members is seen in Fig. 4 A while the pattern for normal transthyretin (prealbumin) is seen in Fig. 4 B. For both profiles, the patterns are identical except in the affected individuals where peak TlIO is observed. Sequence analysis reveals that this is peptide 81103 with a serine for isoleucine at position 84. Sequence analysis of peptide 7 and 7-8 both show only threonine at position 49 for all individuals tested.

Separation was obtained on a Synchrom RP-8 column (1 X 25 cm) using 0.1% TFA in water at a 2 ml/min flow rate as the initial buffer. A double gradient from 0 to 10% acetonitrile in 10 min followed by a gradient from 10 to 35% acetonitrile in 75 min was used to effect separation of the peptides. (B) Separation of the peptides derived from a trypsin digestion of normal plasma transthyretin (3 mg). Conditions were the same as above. All peaks are numbered as in Fig. 2. The two peaks labeled 9 gave identical composition and sequence analyses and may represent modification of the indole ring of Trp 79.  loss of cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan, this is consistent with the loss of these residues in the fibril subunit protein being due to tissue oxidation. From these studies it would seem that the glycine that appears to be at position 49 is not part of the primary structure and that it is not attached to transthyretin (prealbumin) in the plasma. It is possible that the residue is attached after the fibrils are deposited into the tissue and that this modification may be tissue specific. This would explain the presence of the adduct in some amyloid-laden tissues but not in others as has been reported in the amyloid of Jewish origin (16, 19). For the four presymptomatic individuals whose transthyretin (prealbumin) were studied, two of them had peptide TlOV and two did not. Prior studies show that affected individuals in this kindred have low RBP levels, which was true for the two presymptomatic individuals who had peptide TlO'. Therefore, it appears that the occurrence of low plasma RBP levels is associated with the position 84 substitution and may be used to identify carriers of the abnormal gene. All the individuals with the gene coding for seine 84 showed  deposition the variant transthyretin (prealbumin) accounted for 20-25% of the total plasma concentration. However, in individuals not exhibiting active disease the variant concentration was between 30 and 35% of the total serum transthyretin (prealbumin) level. This is consistent with what has been seen in FAP type I individuals and probably represents the enriched deposition of the variant protein in the amyloid fibrils with the resultant depletion of the plasma (12). From the x-ray structure of the transthyretin (prealbumin) molecule it has been determined that position 84 is located on an external loop on the outer surface of the protein between beta sheet strands E and F (20). This position is on one of the most exposed segments of the molecule, and how this substitution leads to the formation of fibrils is uncertain. However, certain features would appear to be important. Position 84 is at the end of a short alpha helical region (positions 78-83) and a mutation from isoleucine to serine will have effects on hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding. Since low ionic strength is known to dissociate transthyretin (prealbumin) and RBP, it would appear that hydrophobic interactions may play an important role in the association of these proteins (21). Thus, the replacement of isoleucine at position 84 with a serine would lead to a major reduction of hydrophobicity in this region and may lead to a higher dissociation constant for these proteins. This reduced affinity for RBP could explain the low serum levels of RBP because unbound to transthyretin (prealbumin) it is quickly cleared by the kidneys (22). How the serine at position 84 will alter the protein structure will have to await x-ray structure analysis of the variant protein. From the genetic code and transthyretin (prealbumin) complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence it is clear that the change from isoleucine to serine involves a single base substitution where the second codon is changed from a uracil (thymine) to a guanine (23-25). This replacement of a purine for a pyrimidine base should alter the DNA so that specific nucleases will give different patterns for the normal and variant genes. Thus, it should be possible to identify carriers ofthis trait by differences in restriction nuclease patterns as has already been shown for the methionine for valine substitution in FAP type I individuals (26) and for alanine for threonine substitution in FAP Appalachian (27).

Sequence analysis on peptides derived from proteolytic cleavage with trypsin and fragmentation with cyanogen bromide reveal that the fibril subunit protein is derived from plasma transthyretin (prealbumin). About two-thirds of the fibril subunit protein was found to contain an amino acid substitution at position 84 where the normal isoleucine residue has been replaced by serine. Sequence analysis of the plasma transthyretin (prealbumin) from the two brothers as well as two clinically diagnosed FAP type II family members and two of four children of affected individuals showed the presence of serine at position 84. The presence of this substitution also correlates with low serum levels of retinol-binding protein and thus transthyretin (prealbumin) position 84 may be involved with the interaction of these two proteins."

SINISCALCO2  During a screening for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency among 100 schoolboys in a lowland Sardinian village (Guspini, altitude 137 m), two persons with incomplete G6PD deficiency were found. They were later subjected to further investigations together with their relatives to find out whether this was due to an intercurrent factor enhancing the enzyme activity of the G6PD Mediterranean variant, known to be highly frequent in the island, or to the presence of a different G6PD variant. Quantitative and electrophoretic studies performed on fresh hemolyzates of the propositi and their relatives soon revealed that the latter interpretation was correct. Interestingly enough, a paternal aunt of one of the propositi was found to be heterozygous for both types of G6PD variants, as proved through the examination of her male offspring, consisting of children with one or the other type of enzyme deficiency. Additional studies performed on partially purified enzyme preparations proved that the three apparently unrelated families were all segregating for the same G6PD variant, which resembles very closely the so-called G6PD Seattle variant. Since the occurrence of incomplete G6PD deficiency in Sardinia is, in our experience, fairly rare, it is likely that the three G6PD Seattle-like variants found in the same village might have arisen, in a relatively remote past, from a common ancestor. The purpose of the present paper is to report in detail the genetic and biochemical studies performed on these families. METHODS  Screening Tests for Red Cell Enzyme Deficiency a) The dye decoloration test of Motulsky and Campbell-Kraut (1961) was used. b) The fluorescence spot test of Beutler (1966) was modified as follows: 0.02 ml of whole heparinized blood was hemolyzed in 1.0 ml of distilled water; one drop of Received June 26, 1968. Supported by U.S. National Institutes of Health grant GM13415 and by the Italian National Research Council.

The mixture was incubated for two hours (room temperature); one drop of it was then spotted on Whatman no. 1 filter paper. After drying, the paper was inspected under a long-wave ultraviolet light as in the original method of Beutler. Under these conditions only blood samples with nearly 100%0 fully enzyme-deficient red cells give nonfluorescent spots, while samples with partial enzyme activity (as low as 10%70 of normal) give clear fluorescent spots. By combining these two tests, it was possible to discriminate the severe type of enzyme deficiency, as found in males hernizygous and females homozygous for Gdl~editerranean*, from the incomplete types of enzyme deficiency observed among women heterozygous for this allele as well as among individuals of either sex carrying other G6PD-deficient alleles (GdA-, Gdseattle, etc.). c) The test for the cellular localization of G6PD was performed on blood samples collected in acid citrate-dextrose (ACD) as described by Gall et al. (1965). A considerable improvement in the quality of slides was obtained by resuspending the red cells in their plasma after the incubation before preparing the smears (S. Piomelli, personal communication). Assay of Enzymic Actizity of Red Blood Cellst This was performed as described by -Motulsky el al. (1966), using a Beckman DU spectrophotometer equipped with Gilford attachment and recorder. Enzyme activity was expressed in international units per gram of hemoglobin according to the formula: (AO.D._340 mu/mmn) X 101 actvit (I/g b) activity (IU/g Hb) = 6.2 2 X Hb X sample volume+'  gi  One international unit is defined as the quantity of enzyme which reduces one micromole NADP per minute.  Electrophoretic Characterization This was carried out by electrophoresis on strips of cellulose acetate gTel ("Ctllogel," from Chemetron, Milan) according to the technique described by Rattazzi et al. (1967) and on starch gel as described by Porter et al. (1964). In these experiments, both fresh hemolyzates and partially purified preparations of red cell G6PD were used after dialysis against the electrophoretic buffers to which NADP (2 X 10- M) and 6-mercaptoethanol (10-3 M) were added. Partial Purification of the Enzyme This was performed by the first two steps of the procedure described by Yoshida (1966). The partially purified preparations obtained in this way showed a 60-120* The nomenclature of G6PD variants recommended in the World Health Organization Technical Report (1967) is used here. t This assay and the following studies on G6PD were performed on blood samples shipped in ice by air to Leiden within three to four days of collection.

Further Characterization Studies These were carried out following the recommendations given by the World Health Organization Report (1967). a) Michaelis constants were determined at 250 C using a Beckman DU monochromator equipped with a Gilford 220 photometer and a Honeywell SC-153 recorder. Reaction rates were determined at six different concentrations of G6P and eight concentrations of NADP; at least one concentration was lower than the Km values. Calculation of the regression coefficient of V (rate) versus V/S (rate/substrate concentration) gave the Km values (Dowd and Riggs, 1965). The standard deviation of the regression coefficient was also calculated, as suggested by McCurdy et al. (1966). b) Thermal stability was studied by the method outlined in the World Health Organization Report, on samples free of ammonium sulphate. c) Substrate analogue utilizations were determined for 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate (2dG6P) and galactose-6-phosphate (Gal 6-P) as described by Kirkman et al. (1964). d) The pH activity curves were determined using the triple buffer technique (Kirkman et al., 1964).  Color Vision Tests Routine screening was performed using the Ishihara and the HHR tables. Any abnormal individual was further tested with the Fifteen Hues Farnsworth Test and the anomaloscope of Nagel. Blood Group Determinations In order to exclude instances of illegal paternity, blood group determinations were performed by the Netherlands Red Cross Central Laboratory for Blood Transfusions, Amsterdam. They included ABO, MNS, Rh, P, Lutheran, Kell, Duffy, and Jk systems.  Xg Tests These were performed at the Medical Research Council, Blood Group Research Unit, Lister Institute, London, by Drs. R. Race and R. Sanger. Linkage lod Scores These were calculated according to the method described by Maynard Smith et al. (1961). A scertainment The propositi who led us to the study of the pedigrees presented in this paper were ascertained in the course of a field study performed in Sardinia. This was part of a training course on human population genetics organized by the Dutch and Italian  International Biological Program Committees and directed by one of the authors  G6PD SEATTLE-LIKE IN SARDINIA  145  (MI. Siniscalco, in preparation). The field study included, among other topics, the screening for G6PD deficiency in 800 school children (500 ed, 300 9 9) in four lowland and two mountain villages by means of the dye decoloration test and the fluorescence test. It was through the combined use of these two tests that the two propositi were noticed as being the only ones giving contrasting results: while their blood samples gave fluorescent spots indistinguishable from those of normal subjects, their decoloration times with the Motulsky test were definitely abnormal, being 100 minutes and 145 minutes, respectively, with an average decoloration time for normal males of 40 minutes ± 3 minutes. Additional screening studies performed on the relatives of these two children soon confirmed the impression that they were carriers of a G6PD variant other than G6PD Mediterranean. Thus, adequate samples of their blood were collected when possible and shipped to the main laboratory in Leiden for further characterization. The incidence of G6PD Mediterranean in the area was otherwise found to be very high (0.32 + 0.01), as was already known from previous work (Siniscalco et al., 1966). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Laboratory Findings and Family Data As stated earlier, and as is clear from the pedigrees in Figures I and 2, the G6PD variant under discussion was found not only in the two propositi and in their male sibs, but also among the sons of a paternal aunt of propositus 4292 (Gus 6A: III-8). Since the segregation of this variant is fully compatible, as will be stressed later, with the hypothesis of sex-linked inheritance, and since on the other hand the grandparents of these three pedigrees apparently are unrelated to each other, the mildly deficient G6PD subjects Gus 6B: III-2, 3; Gus 6A: III-8, 10, ii; and Gus 06: III-1, 2, 3 need not necessarily be carriers of the same mutant allele at the Gd locus. The same, of course, holds true for the female carriers Gus 06: II-2, III-4, and Gus 6A: II-8, 9. In the latter pedigree the subject Gus 6B: 11-3 (paternal aunt of propositus 4292) is a carrier of both the mild deficiency and the Mediterranean type of G6PD variant, as proven by the segregation of the two types of enzyme deficiency in her offspring. Thus, although from the preliminary investigations (summarized in Table 1 and Figure 3) it was fair to assume that we were dealing with the same G6PD variant, its final characterization was carried out separately on several partially purified enzyme preparations from the red cells of different individuals of all three groups of sibs, who had derived their mutant gene through an independent genetic path. The biochemical findings on the partially purified enzymes are summarized in Table 2. As can be seen, there is a remarkable similarity among the samples from the three pedigrees, as well as between them and a sample of the G6PD Seattle variant which was examined alongside the Sardinian samples for a closer comparison. All the mutant enzymes show a decrease in the Km values for both NADP and G6P and an increase in the relative rate of utilization of the G6P analogues, 2dG6P and Gal 6-P. The rate of thermal inactivation is equal to that of the normal controls.

The enzyme activity in the hemolyzates of the male hemizygotes was found to be about 25% of the activity of normal males. The female heterozygotes had, as expected, enzyme activities hardly distinguishable from those of normal females. Two of them, however (Gus 6B: II-3; Gus 6A: I-4), deserve special mention, having red cell enzyme activities lower than, and respectively equal to, that found in the male carriers of the mutant gene.  150  LENZERINI ET AL.  This finding is easily explained in the case of Gus 6B: II-3, since she is, as already mentioned, also heterozygous for the G6PD Mediterranean variant. The electrophoretic pattern of this subject showed only the slow variant band; this is not surprising, since the G6PD Mediterranean band is very seldom visible even in electrophoretic patterns of male hemizygotes. As for Gus 6A: I-4, the low red cell enzyme activity can hardly be explained in the same way, in view of the presence in her offspring of a female (II-6) who appears to be normal by all the criteria used for the classification of G6PD phenotypes (see  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  FiG. 5.-Starch-gel electrophoresis at pH 8 6 of normal and mutant enzymes. Slots 1 and 7: G6PD A. Slots 2 and 6: G6PD B. Slot 3: G6PD Seattle. Slots 4 and 5: G6PD Seattle-like. Migration toward the anode (top).  Table 1). Moreover, the electrophoretic pattern of I-4 showed, unlike that of 6B: 11-3, a faint but distinct band with the same mobility as the normal enzyme in addition to the slow variant band. On the other hand, the interpretation of this pattern as that of a heterozygote GdB/GdSeattle is apparently contradicted by the patterns of the other four female heterozygotes (Gus 6A: II-8, 9; Gus 06: II-2, III-4), in which the staining of the faster band was so strong as to cause it to fuse with the slower band. A possible explanation could be that the X chromosome carrying the normal allele has been inactivated in the great majority of the red blood cells of this subject. The genetic classification of the individuals reported in the pedigrees has been greatly helped by the careful use of the cellular localization test for G6PD (Gall el al., 1965), which in our experience always allows the identification of individuals heterozygous for GdMediterranean (Table 1).  G6PD SEATTLE-LIKE IN SARDINIA  151  None of the individuals examined had a positive history of hemolytic episodes. Direct hematological investigations of the critical members of the pedigree revealed no abnormalities except for subjects Gus 06: II-1, III-3, 5, who were found to be carriers of the i3-thalassemia trait. Blood group studies involving eight systems did not disclose any case of illegal paternity in the three pedigrees. Linkage Data Pedigree Gus 6B apparently is the first pedigree described which segregates for the two G6PD variants, GdMediterrantean and Gdseattle-like. There are five scorable sibs in the offspring of subject II-3, with no instance of recombination. Moreover, in pedigree Gus 6A, the new variant segregates in repulsion with colorblindness of the deuteranopic type, yielding in the third generation a total of six scorable sibs and again no recombinants. The pedigrees were also investigated for Xg types and found to be uninformative for the study of linkage with this locus. CONCLUSIONS  The biochemical characterization of the three cases of incomplete G6PD deficiency described in this paper suggests that they are identical. Although they clearly originated through independent genetic paths and although no family relationship could be traced by a genealogical inquiry going as far back as the fifth generation, it is very likely that they may have derived from a common ancestor, since the village where the three cases come from is small (± 8,000 inhabitants) and highly inbred. The biochemical data also strongly support the hypothesis that the variants described are identical to the G6PD Seattle variant described by Kirkman et al. (1965). Since an unquestionable proof of this identity could only be obtained from peptide mapping studies as performed by Yoshida (1967) on G6PD A and B, we propose provisionally to designate this variant G6PD Seattle-like. From our previous surveys, we can conclude that this type of incomplete G6PD deficiency does not exist in appreciable frequency in Sardinia. Indeed, in a total of about 2,000 males examined quantitatively for G6PD red cell activity in the whole of Sardinia over the past 10 years, only four were found showing G6PD activity values in the range of that expected for this variant. Moreover, in a random sample of 640 males collected in different parts of the island, no electrophoretic variants could be found. The incidence of this variant may instead be appreciable in Greece, where Motulsky (1964) mentioned the existence of a similar enzyme type and where we found five unrelated cases of it in a total of 300 unrelated individuals (200 schoolboys from the island of Kefalonia and 100 unrelated members of hemophilic families). Two of these five variants have been characterized (Rattazzi et al., 1969) and found to be similar if not identical to the Sardinian ones and to the Seattle variant itself. Thus, it may well be that the Seattle variant did in fact originate in the Mediterranean basin.  152  LENZERINI ET AL.  Finally, it seems fair to conclude that the biochemical and linkage data, together with the constant finding of a single electrophoretic band in male carriers and a "fused" or double band in their mothers and daughters, add substantial strength to the hypothesis that the G6PD Seattle-like variant is indeed due to an X-horne mutant allelomorphic to the Gd locus. SUMMARY  Three apparently unrelated families, the members of which carried an incomplete type of red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with decreased electrophoretic mobility of the enzyme, have been found in Sardinia. Partially purified preparations of the variant enzyme showed decreased Michaelis constants for glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), increased utilization of galactose-6-phosphate (Gal 6-P) and 2deoxyglucose-6-phosphate (2dG6P), normal thermal stability, and a slightly biphasic pH-activity curve. Very similar if not identical electrophoretic and biochemical features were shown in a sample of G6PD Seattle tested at the same time, suggesting that this enzyme may be identical to the variants described. Pending a final proof of this identity, we propose to call this variant G6PD Seattle-like. In one pedigree, the variant was found to segregate together with the G6PD Mediterranean variant, and, in another pedigree, with colorblindness of the deuteranopic type. Biochemical, electrophoretic, and genetic data strongly support the hypothesis that the G6PD Seattle-like variant is due to an X-linked mutant allelomorphic to the Gd locus.

"1","The clinical aspects of a study of a large family suffering from glomus tumors are presented. A great deal of fragmentary information is obtained from the literature, but never before has so much information been obtained from one single family. The aim of this study was to screen the individual members of this family by careful history, with special interest taken in symptoms which could be indicative of glomus tumors, and by a physical examination. Because these tumors may be without symptoms or signs, the screening was extended with dynamic angioscintigraphy.Familial non-chromaffinic paragangliomas (glomus tumors) : clinical aspects."

This paper surveys the literature on familial nonchromaffin paragangliomas and presents the results of a study of a family with 295 living members.  Introduction The names adopted in the literature to designate the tumours described in the present paper, have not been uniform from the beginning. This discrepancy is largely attributable to a difference of opinion. Originally, the terms glomus tissue and glomus tumour were used to designate the normal physiological condition and the hyperplastic condition respectively. The term glomus was adopted because of the ball-like character of the tissue when it was examined under the light microscope. This name was retained later in view of its neutral character. The problem of embryogenesis of the glomera was initially a controversial matter in the literature. Today it is universally accepted that the paraganglionic cells, like spinal and sympathetic ganglia, are derived from the neural crests (Kjaergaard 1973). Paraganglia belong to two systems, viz. to the orthosympathetic system and to the parasympathetic system. The parasympathetic paraganglia are situated along the course of the parasympathetic nerves (ninth, tenth, and eleventh cranial nerves), particularly at those points at which they intersect with the large vessels. The specification nonchromaffin was added as it was a characteristic of these paraganglia that they were not stainable by chromates. They show an afferent (sensory) parasympathetic innervation and their function is probably chemoreceptive in character (Lattes 1950; Fernandez et al. 1975). The terms glomus body and glomus body tumour predominate in the clinical literature, in which a topographic designation is added, such as carotid body and carotid body tumour. Because of the presumably chemoreceptive function, chemodectoma is also commonly used. In the genetic literature (McKusick 1978; no. 16800), the name nonchromaffin paraganglioma (NCP), suggested by Lattes and Waltner (1949), is adopted. This is done to avoid problems of nomenclature regarding a related clinical picture, e.g. multiple glomus tumours (McKusick 1978, no. 13800). Multiple glomus tumours are multiple flesh-coloured to blue nodules in the skin, 0.3 to 3.0 cm in diameter. They may occasionally involve deeper structures Offprint requests to: C. Cremers  such as bone. The characteristic histopathological features are endothelium-lined dilated vascular spaces which are surrounded by one or more layers of the oval glomus tumour (small muscle) cells. The most common localizations of NCP in the region of the head and neck are the tympanic and jugular glomera, also jointly designated as glomus jugulotympanicum, the gtomus vagale, and the carotid glomus. Occasionally there are high cervical localizations in the region of the arch of the aorta and the branch of the pulmonary artery, and retroperitoneal localizations in the region of the branches of the mesenteric artery. The clinical aspects of this study are discussed in detail elsewhere (van Baars et al. 1981).  Survey of the Literature The literature includes 32 papers in which cases of familial NCP were reported. As shown in Table 1, there were 160 patients, 83 males and 77 females. Eight families were described in sufficient detail to make it possible to calculate the numbers affected per generation (Table 2). The ratio of number of patients to the number of all members examined in the second generation is 34 : 59. In the third generation, 21 patients were detected among 71 descendants of identified patients. The localizations of tumours described in the literature are given in Table 3.  Family Studies Subjects and Methods  Four large branches of a family were united into a single pedigree by genealogical studies. Each branch had its own proband. The mutual relationships of branches 16.08.06, 16.08.08, 16.08.16, and 16.12.07 are shown in Fig. 1. All lineal descendants over 15, subsequently 20 years of age, were invited to undergo an examination. A total of 162 subjects were studied. The methods of investigation included otorhinological examination, including palpation of the neck; neurological examination of the cranial nerves; hearing tests; and scintiscanning of the blood vessels. Dynamic and skeletal scanning (Ruys et al. 1978; Veldman et al. 1980) were used as supplementary methods of screening. At the same time blood from many members of the family was used for the typing of genetic markers in the search for a possible linkage of the gene for NCP with some marker.  0340-6717/82/0060/0305/$ 01.00  306 Table 1.

The sex ratio a m o n g proven cases of familial N C P reported in the literature is male (M): female (F) = 83:77. H e r r m a n n (1977) claims that the offspring of female patients includes a significantly smaller n u m b e r of patients. He actually states that the n u m b e r of mothers with affected offspring is significantly smaller than expected in view of the sex ratio. The 26 patients in the presented family included 20 men and 6 women. This differs significantly from a normal sex ratio (P > 0.001). Nevertheless, the sex ratio a m o n g members of the family ( M : F = 86:76; P > 0 . 4 0 ) and the offspring of proven patients ( M : F = 35:31; P > 0.30) was not actually disturbed. In examining a family as large as the one described in the present study, some selection of male patients is indeed f o u n d to have occurred when viewed in retrospect. The study started with branches 16.08.06 and 16.08.08, with two propositi that had the same family-name and were first cousins once removed. The third b r a n c h o f the family, 16.08.16, was also traced as this branch had the same family-name. Finally, a fourth branch (16.12.07) was added, and on inquiry the propositus stated that his g r a n d m o t h e r had the same family-name as the other propositi. This m e a n t that there was a selection of male patients (the quoted n u m b e r e d brothers and a niece), who had patients a m o n g their offspring with the same name. None the less, it is possible that the sex difference observed in our study, and claimed by H e r r m a n n , is actually due to a difference in penetrance in the two sexes. This is also k n o w n to be the case with some other autosomal clinical pictures, e.g. Alport's syndrome. The results obtained in the marker gene studies show that absolute linkage (0% recombination) is out of the question using those markers which supplied enough information. Even on a 5% r e c o m b i n a t i o n level Rhesus, AK, GPT, Pi, GC, and K M are found to be excluded. If slightly more information was available, even 10% recombination would also be excluded for a n u m b e r of genetic markers. There is one notable exception to this interpretation o f the lod scores and that is the positive score for low recombination fractions with LU. The collection of more data on this point and on Secretor would be desirable, but will be hampered by the late (45 years) penetrance of NCP. A close linkage would give an optimal possibility of early diagnosis.  Acknowledgements. The genealogical study was performed by Mrs. A. Cremers-Vroom.

Sequence analysis of DNA from 19 unrelated patients detected six novel mutations and three previously reported mutations. Identification of additional mutations extends the distribution of connexin32 mutations in X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and shows that specific mutations recur in additional families. NEUROLOGY 1995;45:1863-1866  X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a peripheral neuropathy characterized by progressive distal extremity weakness, atrophy, sensory loss, and areflexia. Males are more severely affected than females, with usual onset of symptoms in adolescence. Nerve conduction velocities range between 25 a n d 40 mlsec i n affected males, whereas heterozygous females have values between 25 and 50 d s e c . Linkage studies and recombination analysis'-'j mapped the CMTX gene to the proximal long arm of the X chromosome at Xq13.1. Connexin32 (Cx32) was also mapped within this region of the X ~ h r o m o s o m esuggesting ,~~~ it as a candidate gene for CMTX. Northern blot analysis demonstrated Cx32 expression i n normal peripheral nerve, and we9 identified mutations associated with CMTX by direct sequencing of the coding region of  the Cx32 gene. Cx32 is a 32-kD gap junction protein originally isolated from liver.1°-12It is expressed in kidney, intestine, lung, spleen, stomach, testes, and brain as well as in peripheral n e r ~ e . Gap ~ J ~junctions are intercellular channels made of two hemichannels, each composed of connexin molecules arranged around a central pore.I4J5The pore is thought to be lined by polar residues from the third transmembrane domainl'j and allows passage of ions and small molecules of up to 1,000 daltons. The channel diameter is estimated to be 1.2 nm, preventing the passage of larger molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Others have confirmed our finding of Cx32 mutations in CMTX familie~.'~-~l Here, we describe additional mutations in Cx32. Our results show that  From the Department of Neurology (Drs.

Methods. Blood samples were obtained from family members under a protocol of informed consent. Genomic DNA was extracted from venous blood by established methods2 Two fragments that together encompass the entire Cx32 gene coding region, one of 306 and one of 666 base pairs, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers and conditions previously publ i ~ h e d These .~ fragments were purified with t h e Geneclean DNA purification kit (BIO 101). The PCR fragments were directly analyzed by automated cycle sequencing with fluorescent tagged terminators on an Applied Biosystems, Inc. sequencer, using the same primers as for amplification plus two additional internal primers that were also previously p ~ b l i s h e dPatient .~ sequences were compared with control sequences to reveal mutations within the coding region of the Cx32 gene. 1864 NEUROLOGY 45 October 1996  For those mutations that result in changes in restriction sites, as determined by computer analysis of the new sequence, genotypes of individuals were determined by restriction endonuclease digestion of the appropriate PCR fragment. Each reaction was analyzed by electrophoresis in 1 to 5% agarose gels, with ethidium bromide for visualization.  Results. Direct sequencing of the Cx32 gene in CMTX patients revealed five novel missense mutations and one novel frameshift mutation (table). These mutations included a valinejleucine substitution at codon 13 in the amino terminal intracellular domain i n p a t i e n t sample PQ; a n isoleucinejasparagine substitution at codon 30 in the middle of the first transmembrane domain in family 266; a tyrosinejcysteine substitution at codon 65 in the first extracellular loop adjacent to the third highly conserved cysteine residue in family 1850; a valinejmethionine substitution at codon  Table.

Three recurrent mutations were also identified during sequencing. Two families (nos. 264 and 265) showed a previously reported nonsense mutation predicting truncation of t h e protein a t amino acid 22O.l7 One family (no. 69) showed a codon 139 valinejmethionine missense mutation, also in the third transmembrane domain.y Another family (no. 269) showed recurrence of the codon 156 leucine-arginine missense mutation located in the second extracellular loopg None of the reported families with the same mutation a r e known to be related. In most cases, families with the same mutation are from different geographic regions. For example, family 69 is from New York, and the other two families with the identical mutation are from South Dakota and Michigan, with no known New York connection. Nine families analyzed had no mutation within the coding region of Cx32. Seven of these represent sporadic cases, one has affected members in only two generations, and another is a large, multigenerational kindred previously reported t o be Xlinked.23Affected individuals in all these families had features clinically consistent with CMTX. For seven of the nine mutations, changes in restriction endonuclease sites allowed the analysis of mutation segregation. These seven changes include the gain of a Nla 111 site in family 69, the gain of a Dde I site in families 264 and 265, the loss of a Mbo I1 site in family 266, the gain of an Hha I site in family 269, the loss of a BbrPI site in family 272, the gain of a Mae I11 site in family 1850, and the gain of a Dra I11 site in family VA. Restriction-site changes allowed these mutations to be analyzed in unrelated normal individuals to rule out the possi-  Reference 9 Reference 17 Reference 17 Reference 9  bility that they represent naturally occurring polymorphisms, to be traced through the remainder of the families, and to be used to diagnose carrier status in females. In each case, the putative mutations were not found in a screening of 50 unrelated, normal females.  Discussion. Cx32 mutations are directly associated with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The mechanism by which these mutations cause the phenotype remains unknown, but the presence of mutations in almost all regions of the molecule indicates that most of the molecule is important to the function of Cx32 in Schwann cells. Cx32 localizes by immunohistochemistry to the nodes of Ranvier and the Schmidt-Lantermann incisures in peripheral n e r ~ eOther .~ forms of Charcot-MarieTooth disease, types 1A and l B , are associated with mutations in myelin genes, peripheral myelin protein 22 kD (PMP-22) in type 1A and protein zero (PO) in type lB.24These proteins are in compact myelin, whereas Cx32 is in noncompact myelin. However, the similarities of the resulting disease phenotypes indicate t h a t each of these Schwann cell proteins has an important function in peripheral nerve. The variety of mutations found suggests that virtually all regions of Cx32 are important in its function. Families linked to the region of the X chromosome where Cx32 is located but without mutations in the open reading frame suggest that mutations in noncoding regions of the gene, such as the promoter and splice sites, may be responsible for causing the d i s e a ~ e .These ~ , ~ ~regions need to be further studied. Gap junctions allow the passage of ions and small molecules as well as conduction of electrical currents. The loss of junctional conductance in the paired oocyte expression system with three of the originally described mutant Cx32 molecules suggests that these mutations cause a loss of Cx32 function.25Analysis of these mutants revealed a October 1995 NEUROLOGY 45 1865  dominant negative effect for one mutation when coexpressed with connexin 26 but not connexin 40. Depending on the mutation, the mechanism of disease may be either a loss of product effect or a dominant negative effect, as reported in Marfan’s syndrome.26Further identification of mutations may allow a genotype-phenotype correlation, which could aid in defining the CMTX disease mechanism.

Here we report defects in a third member of this biochemical pathway in still other patients with this disease. We screened 94 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant RP and 173 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive RP for mutations in the gene encoding the a subunit of the rod cGMP-gated cation channel. Five mutant sequences cosegregated with disease among four unrelated families with autosomal recessive RP. Two of these were nonsense mutations early in the reading frame (Glu76End and Lysl39End) and one was a deletion encompassing most if not all of the transcriptional unit; these three alleles would not be expected to encode a functional channel. The remaining two mutations were a missense mutation (Ser316Phe) and a frameshift [Arg654(1-bp del)] mutation truncating the last 32 aa in the C terminus. The latter two mutations were expressed in vitro and found to encode proteins that were predominantly retained inside the cell instead of being targeted to the plasma membrane. We conclude that the absence or paucity of functional cGMP-gated cation channels in the plasma membrane is deleterious to rod photoreceptors and is an uncommon cause of RP.  The genomic structure and sequence of the 10 exons encoding the a subunit have been determined (12, 13), allowing one to screen this sequence for defects in patients. This a subunit can also be expressed in vitro and its channel activity can be quantified (9, 13).  MATERIALS AND METHODS Ascertainment of Patients. Patients were categorized by the inheritance pattern of the disease as described (14). A set of 96 unrelated individuals without known photoreceptor degeneration were recruited as normal controls. After informed consent, blood samples were collected from each patient and normal control, and leukocyte DNA was purified. Screening for Mutations. The single-strand conformation polymorphism technique was used to screen for point mutations or other small-scale sequence changes (15). The PCR was carried out in 96-well microtiter plates with the following sets of primers (sense/antisense): exon 3, TTCTCCTCAGATATGAAACT/TAAATTAAAGAACITGTAGCT; exon 4, CTG-  CAGTGGTTGAAAACATT/GCACCAAGGGATGGATCATA; exon 5, TATTGTGATTTCACTGCATG/GATTCAGATATATTCCTACA; exons 6 and 7, AAATAAGAGTGGAAGACTGT/GGAAAATCATCCCTGCATCT7; exon 8, TTCTTGTATCTTGGTAACTA/TGAACTTGGAAACTAGAAAT; exon 9, TTTATTTATACAAGTGTTTC/AAATATTCAAAACTGAACAT; exon 10a, AAGGAGAAA-  Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a genetically heterogeneous set of diseases in which affected individuals develop progressive degeneration of the rod and cone photoreceptors. Patients typically experience night blindness by age 20 followed by progressive loss of peripheral visual field and later central visual field that leads to blindness usually in middle age. Oral vitamin A supplementation slows the course of the disease in most cases (1). Dominant, recessive, X chromosome-linked, and digenic patterns of inheritance are exemplified by families with RP, and even among the families with the same inheritance pattern, there is nonallelic heterogeneity. More than 15 genes have been implicated by linkage studies, five of which have been identified to date. Two of these genes encode proteins known to function in the phototransduction pathway [namely, rhodopsin (2) and the ,3 subunit of rod cGMPphosphodiesterase (3)], two are photoreceptor-specific proteins of unknown function [peripherin/RDS (4-6) and ROM1 (6)], and one is an unconventional myosin (7). Here we report the analysis of the gene encoding the a subunit of the rod cGMP-gated cation channel, which is the protein involved in the last stage of the phototransduction pathway (for review, see ref. 8). The rod cGMP-gated cation channel is a heterooligomer composed of two homologous subunits (a and (3), each with cytoplasmic N and C termini, six putative transmembrane domains, and a pore region (9-11).  CACTGAATTGA/CGTAACAACCTGTTTAATCT; exon 10b, GTTAGGGTGGAACTATCCAG/CCTATGTTACCAACGATGGT; exon 10c, CTTTGTGGTGGTTGATTTCC/TTGCAATTTCAAGACCAACT;exonlOd,TTTGCTGATTGTGAAGCTGG/GCCAAGATTCGGGCAAACCT; exon 10e, CAGTAGACCTCCITGCAAACC/CATGTCCCTGTTAATGACCA. Variant bands were evaluated by direct genomic sequencing of the corresponding PCR-amplified DNA segments (16). Sequence variations expected to affect protein sequence or expression were evaluated by the singlestrand conformation polymorphism technique for cosegregation with the disease in the relatives of the respective probands. In selected cases, Southern blot analysis was used to screen for gene deletions or rearrangements with radiolabeled cDNA fragments (probe pCNCG) derived from the human a subunit of the cGMP-gated channel gene (13). Expression of the Ser316Phe and Arg654(1-bp del) Alleles in Vitro. The cDNA encoding the a subunit of the human cGMP-gated cation channel was inserted into the polylinker site of pCIS (17). In vitro mutagenesis of the wild-type channel cDNA to produce the Ser316Phe and Arg654(1-bp del) mutations identified in patients was carried out with standard procedures with single-stranded DNA and oligonucleotides.

Electrical Recordings. At 48-72 hr after transfection, patchclamp recordings were made from excised inside-out membrane patches of transfected HEK-293 cells at room temperature. The patch pipette contained "O-Ca2+" solution (140 mM NaCl/5 mM KCl/1 mM Na2-EGTA/10 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6). The bath perfusate before establishment of a membrane seal was Ringer's solution (140 mM NaCl/5 mM KCl/10 mM HepesNaOH/2 mM CaCl2/1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.6). Before excision of the patch, the bath perfusate was switched to "0-Ca2+" solution. Appropriate concentrations of cGMP were added to the bath solution. Immunocytochemistry. Transfected cells were harvested from a culture dish, centrifuged, and, after resuspension, pipetted onto a poly(D-lysine)-coated microscope slide. The cells were fixed overnight in 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.3) at 4°C and then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Triton X-100 (0.1%) was A.

We identified two categories of deviations from the published sequence (13). The first group of anomalies were deemed polymorphisms or rare variants unrelated to disease because (i) they were predicted not to alter the sequence of the encoded protein, (ii) they did not cosegregate with RP in families carrying them, or (iii) they were found with approximately equal frequency among patients with dominant disease, recessive disease, or no disease (i.e., unaffected individuals who served as controls). In this category of presumably nonpathogenic sequence variations were three silent changes in the coding region (affecting codons Glu-100, Thr-469, and Phe-540), two missense changes (Arg28Gln and Aspll4Asn), two single-base variations in introns (A vs. T 29 bp upstream of exon 4 and C vs. T 26 bp upstream of exon 6), and a variation in the length of a poly(A) repeat in intron 8 (see Table 1 for allele frequencies). The second group of anomalies all altered the sequence or expression of the encoded protein and were ultimately interpreted as pathogenic mutations. Of the five mutations in this group, three clearly were null alleles: two nonsense mutations occurring early in the reading frame (Glu76End and Lysl39End, Fig. 1 A and B) and a deletion of most or all of the transcriptional unit that was indicated by the reduced intensity of hybridizing bands by Southern blot analysis (data not illustrated). Although the remaining two mutations altered the sequence of the encoded protein, it was not obvious from inspection whether they would interfere with the protein's function. These were a missense mutation (Ser3l6Phe, Fig. 1C) in the fifth putative transmembrane domain and a frameshift mutation [Arg654(1-bp del), Fig. ID] near the end of the reading frame that leads to the alteration of aa 654 and truncation of the C-terminal 32 aa residues. Cosegregation Analysis. Four families with autosomal recessive RP each segregated one or two of the five mutations. In three of the families, the affected individuals were either homozygous for a mutation [Arg 654(1-bp del) in family 6162, Fig. 1E] or were compound heterozygotes (Lys139End and Ser316Phe in family 7067, Fig. iF; Ser316Phe and gene deletion in family B162, Fig. 1G). Unaffected relatives either had no mutation or were heterozygote carriers for only one mutation. Based on the cosegregation of these mutations with the disease and the results from the expression of the Ser316Phe and Arg654(1-bp del) mutations in vitro (see below), we concluded that these mutations are the cause of RP in these three families. In the fourth family with recessive RP (family 6829, Fig. lH), the nonsense mutation Glu76End was present heterozygously in the two affected sisters and in their unaffected father. No mutation was detected in the maternally derived allele in the two affected sisters. In fact, analysis with the polymorphism  s@  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92 (1995)  10179  Aspll4Asn showed that they received different alleles at this locus from their mother (Fig. 1H). Because of the absence of a pathogenic mutation in the maternally derived alleles in these two sisters, it is possible that there is a pathogenic mutation in a gene encoding another subunit of the channel protein or some other protein that interacts with the a subunit and that the combination of the two defects is the cause of RP. This explanation would be reminiscent of the digenic inheritance that has been previously discovered among some families with RP in which affected members are double heterozygotes for mutations in the unlinked peripherin/RDS and ROMI genes (6). An alternative possibility is that this mutation is not the cause of RP in this family. One individual with autosomal dominant RP carried the Ser316Phe mutation heterozygously. Five available affected members of the corresponding family (6003) had been previously found to carry heterozygously the rhodopsin missense mutation Pro347Leu (20), whereas the channel protein mutation was present only in two affected siblings and their unaffected mother. There was no clear difference in phenotype between the relatives who carried only the rhodopsin mutation  A.Wild Type  1.0.  control  control  0  0  _  E  0.42  j4 pA 100  10  30 ms  1600  [cGMP] (gM  B.

We concluded that the rhodopsin mutation was the cause of the siblings' retinitis pigmentosa and that in addition they carried the recessive channel protein mutation Ser316Phe by chance and without obvious effect. Expression of the Ser316Phe and Arg654(1-bp del) Alleles in Vitro. To check for any functional defects in the Ser316Phe and Arg654(1-bp del) mutant proteins that might support their role in RP, we introduced these mutations into a rod channel cDNA sequence and transiently expressed the mutant proteins in cultured HEK-293 cells. Inside-out patches of plasma membrane were excised from transfected cells and tested for sensitivity to bath-applied cGMP. With either mutant, the frequency of detecting functional cGMP-activated channels was extremely low. With the Ser316Phe point mutation, only 3 out of a total of 85 patches tested responded to cGMP. Two of these responsive patches apparently had a single cGMPgated channel, while the third had perhaps 7 channels, as judged from the size of the macroscopic current at a saturating cGMP concentration. In parallel transfections with the wildtype cDNA, 15 out of 28 tested patches were responsive to cGMP; the induced current was also generally much larger, indicating the presence of a much greater number of channels (between 8 and 470). With the Arg654(1-bp del) mutation, only 1 out of 83 patches responded to cGMP, and it again had a single channel; in contrast, 17 out of 37 patches in parallel experiments with the wild-type channel responded to cGMP with much larger currents (equivalent to between 13 and 170 channels per patch). Despite the low frequency of detected mutant channels in the plasma membrane, these channels nonetheless did not show significant deviations from the normal channels in either the open-channel current or the dependence on cGMP concentration. In Fig. 2 Left, singlechannel openings of the wild-type and the two mutant channels are compared. In all three cases, the single-channel current at +60 mV was -1.8 pA. The open times also appeared to be comparable, though this parameter has not been examined closely. In Fig. 2 Right, the dose-response relations between current activation and cGMP concentration are plotted. There is good agreement in this relation between wild-type channel and the Arg654(1-bp del) mutant. The deviation in this relation between wild-type and the Ser316Phe mutant also may not be significant, because the sample size for the mutant is too small; K112 values for the wild-type channel have been observed to be as large as 100 ,uM (10, 13). The possibility that the cGMP-gated channels on the plasma membrane of cells transfected with the mutant cDNAs represented endogenous  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92 (1995) Table 2.

To examine whether the paucity of expressed mutant channels on the plasma membrane of HEK-293 cells is due to poor expression of the proteins or their failure to reach the surface membrane, we stained the transfected cells with the monoclonal antibody PMc 2G11 (19), which recognizes an epitope on the C-terminal segment; this epitope is still present in the Ser316Phe and Arg654(1-bp del) proteins. Confocal microscopic images of the stained cells clearly show the wild-type protein located almost exclusively on the surface membrane of the HEK-293 cells (Fig. 3A), whereas the mutant proteins appear to be predominantly trapped inside the cell (Fig. 3 B and C). Collected data leading to a similar conclusion are presented in Table 2. Mock-transfected cells were also examined, and they did not show any staining (data not shown). Thus, the mutant proteins were expressed, and the rare presence of functional channels as assayed electrophysiologically appeared to be due to their failure to reach the plasma membrane.  DISCUSSION We have presented evidence that mutations in the gene encoding the a subunit of the cGMP-gated channel protein are  FIG. 3.

The nonailelic heterogeneity in RP is highlighted by the recognition that '80% of cases are still without an identified cause. Since three of the six identified genes code for proteins in the phototransduction cascade, it is likely that genes encoding other members of this pathway will be found to be the cause of some of the remaining cases.

Arrows point to the first residue altered by four of the mutations described in this paper. The fifth mutation is a deletion of the entire gene (not illustrated).  of autosomal recessive RP. Three of the mutant alleles (Glu76End, Lysl39End, and a deletion of the gene) are null either because they would encode a protein without the transmembrane domains and the pore forming region (Fig. 4) or because they would encode no protein at all. When expressed in vitro, the remaining two alleles [Ser316Phe and Arg654(1-bp del)] encoded channels that, while functional, mostly failed to reach the plasma membrane. Based on these observations, it is likely that the pathogenesis of photoreceptor degeneration due to these mutations is a consequence of the paucity or lack of cGMP-gated channels on the plasma membrane of the rod outer segments. An alternative explanation, at least for the Ser316Phe and Arg654(1-bp del) mutant proteins, would be that these mutant proteins cause disease by accumulating inside the rod inner segment and by interfering with protein processing or the general metabolism of the photoreceptors, as thought to be the case for some rhodopsin mutants causing autosomal dominant RP (21, 22). However, this latter explanation does not seem likely in view of the recessive nature of these channel mutations. The molecular basis for the intracellular retention of the Ser316Phe and Arg654(1-bp del) mutant proteins remains to be identified. In normal rod photoreceptors, wild-type channels close in the light due to a reduction in cytoplasmic cGMP. In patients with RP due to these recessive null mutations, the rod photoreceptors would functionally mimic wild-type photoreceptors exposed to constant bright light because there would be few or no open cGMP-gated channels. It remains undetermined whether this predicted perturbation in the physiology of photoreceptors is actually the cause of their degeneration. Mutations associated with the a subunit of the cGMP channel were found to be responsible for only 3 or 4 out of 173 unrelated cases of recessive RP and none of 94 cases of dominant RP. Since about half of all cases of RP are due to autosomal recessive mutations, the gene encoding the a subunit of the channel protein accounts for only -1% of cases of this disease. If one includes both dominant and recessive mutations at the six RP loci so far identified, one locus (rhodopsin) accounts for -10% of all cases (20) and the remaining five loci together (peripherin/RDS, ROMI, the subunit of cGMP-phosphodiesterase, myosin VIIA, and the a subunit of the cGMP-gated channel) account for another -10% of cases (refs. 3, 6, and 23 and unpublished observaa cause  1.

We have analysed 60 families with a history of breast and/or ovarian cancer for germline mutations in BRCA1. Twenty-two different mutations were detected in 32 families (53%), of which 14 are previously unreported. We observed a significant correlation between the location of the mutation in the gene and the ratio of breast to ovarian cancer incidence within each family. Our data suggest a transition in risk such that mutations in the 3' third of the gene are associated with a lower proportion of ovarian cancer. Haplotype analysis supports previous data which suggest some BRCA1 mutation carriers have common ancestors; however, we have found at least two examples where recurrent mutations appear to have arisen independently."
"1","Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) is an autosomal dominant disorder manifesting as cardiac hypertrophy with myocyte disarray and an increased risk of sudden death. Mutations in five different loci cause FHC and 3 disease genes have been identified: beta cardiac myosin heavy chain, alpha tropomyosin and cardiac troponin T. Because these genes encode contractile proteins, other FHC loci are predicted also to encode sarcomere components. Two further FHC loci have been mapped to chromosomes 11p13-q13 (CMH4, ref. 6) and 7q3 (ref. 7). The gene encoding the cardiac isoform of myosin binding protein-C (cardiac MyBP-C) has recently been assigned to chromosome 11p11.2 and proposed as a candidate FHC gene. Cardiac MyBP-C is arrayed transversely in sarcomere A-bands and binds myosin heavy chain in thick filaments and titin in elastic filaments. Phosphorylation of MyBP-C appears to modulate contraction. We report that cardiac MyBP-C is genetically linked to CMH4 and demonstrate a splice donor mutation in one family with FHC and a duplication mutation in a second. Both mutations are predicted to disrupt the high affinity, C-terminal, myosin-binding domain of cardiac MyBP-C. These findings define cardiac MyBP-C mutations as the cause of FHC on chromosome 11p and reaffirm that FHC is a disease of the sarcomere.Mutations in the cardiac myosin binding protein-C gene on chromosome 11 cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.© 1995 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/naturegenetics  © 1995 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/naturegenetics  © 1995 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/naturegenetics  © 1995 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/naturegenetics  "

The majority of the mutations detected correlate with a severe clinical presentation of the disease, which is normally associated with pancreatic insufficiency and severe or moderate lung involvement. As the majority of CF mutations are uncommon it is difficult to obtain a reasonable phenotype/genotype correlation, which would serve to asses the severity of the different CF mutations. The complete identification of the CF genotypes in the different CF patients, in which a severe mutation is known to be present, provides an important resource for the characterization of the level of severity of the other mutation in the patient (2). In other cases, homozygosity for a given mutation can serve in the analysis of severity of CF mutations, although patients homozygous for a mild mutation are rare (3). We report here, a new missense mutation (P205S) in the first transmembrane domain of the CFTR gene, which is associated with a mild CF phenotype, pancreatic sufficiency and without gastrointestinal symptoms. Mutation P205S was identified, in one patient, in exon 6a, after SSCP analysis of 20 exons of theCT77?gene ( 1 - 7 , 10-14a, 15-16, and 17b-21) in a panel of 40 unrelated Spanish CF patients. Further association of P205S with CFTR microsatellites (4) and screening in a large sample of Spanish CF chromosomes were performed. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes according to standard protocols. PCR conditions were: denaturation at 95°C for 30 sec, annealing at 56°C for 30 sec and extension at 74°C for 40 sec in 35 cycles. The reaction mix contained 0.1 yX of [a-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 1 yX of PCR buffer (Perkin Elmer Cetus N808-0006), 60 yM of each dNTP, 10 pmols of each primer, 100 ng of DNA and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase in a final volume of 10 yX. The primers used were 6ai-5 and 6ai-3 (5). After PCR, DNA products of exon 6a were digested with MbdQ.. SSCP electrophoresis was run at 4°C on a 6% nondenaturing poly aery lamide gel without glycerol, at 30 watts for 5 hours. One abnormal band was detected in the samples analysed. The individual with the abnormal band was PCRamplified and then purified with Strategene PrimeErase Quik columns (#400705). Direct automatic sequencing was performed with 3.5 pmols of sequencing primer, and 7 yX of the purified PCR product, using Taq DyeDeoXy™ Terminator Cycle * To whom correspondence should be addressed  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article-abstract/2/10/1741/637846 by Reprints Desk user on 23 May 2018  Sequencing Kit (ABI) (#401113), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Sequencing conditions were denaturation at 96°C for 30 sec, annealing at 50°C for 30 sec and extension at 60°C for 4 min for 28 cycles. In the analysis of exon 6a we have detected one sample (91-229) with an abnormal SSCP-migration pattern. Direct sequencing of the sample, using primers 6ai-5 and 6ai-3, showed a C to T substitution at nucleotide 745 that replaces serine with proline at codon 205 (mutation P205S) (Figure 1). This causes the substitution of a polar amino acid for a non-polar one, in a membrane spanning region of the first transmembrane domain, which could affect the normal folding of the CFTR protein and be the cause of the CF phenotype. P205S does not affect any restriction enzyme site and it was found associated with haplotype 1 6 - 4 4 - 1 3 (TVS8CA-IVS17BTA-IVS17BCA) (4). For a rapid screening of the mutation, we designed a mutagenesis primer (6) E6XD1 5'-TGGCACATTTCGTGTGAATCGC-3', which creates a Xmnl site if the change C to T, that leads to P205S, is present. Screening of mutation P205S in our sample of CF chromosomes was partially based on its association with the microsatellite haplotype 16—44-13. CF patients with this haplotype were PCR amplified using the E6XD1 mutagenesis primer and primer 6ai-3 and digested with Xmnl. A total of three independent P205S alleles were found in the sample analysed (3/950) with a final estimated frequency of 0.3%. Clinical data (Table 1) were available for four CF patients carrying mutation P205S (3 were from the same family). The patients were between 4 and 24 years-old, 2 of which were diagnosed when they were 12 and 15 years of age. None of the patients have had gastrointestinal symptoms or pancreatic disease. All patients have had lung colonization with bacterial pathogens, but they have an excellent general status. Patient (91—394) was also diagnosed for congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, which has been associated with mutations in the CFTR gene (7). The mutations in the other chromosome of the patients, for which clinical data were available, were AF508 or 36O1-111G->C. AF508 is known to be a severe mutation and 3601-111G—C is also associated with a severe CF phenotype with pancreatic insufficiency and lung disease (M.Chilldn and X.Estivill, unpublished). Clinical presentations of patients carrying P205S suggest its association with a mild CF phenotype, with pancreatic suffiency and without gastrointestinal symptoms.

The proline in codon 205 is conserved in the CFTR gene of Human, Mouse, Bovine, Xenopus and Dogfish (8). The change could alter thefoldingof the CFTR protein and so, weakly affect, but not completely, the correct functioning of the CFTR protein. Functional studies of this mutation, regarding the chloride channel activity of CFTR for P2O5S, should provide further insights about its role in the CF phenotype.

In most CMT1 families, the disease cosegregates with a 1.5-Mb duplication on chromosome 17pl 1.2 (CMT1A). A few patients have been found with mutations in the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP-22) gene located in the CMT1A region. In other families mutations have been identified in the major peripheral myelin protein P0 gene localized on chromosome lq21-q23 (CMT1B). We performed a rapid mutation screening of the PMP-22 and P0 genes in non-duplicated CMT1 patients by singlestrand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by direct polymerase chain reaction sequencing of genomic DNA. Six new single base changes in the P0 gene were observed: two missense mutations in, respectively, exons 2 and 3, two nonsense mutations in exon 4, and two silent mutations or polymorphisms in, respectively, exons 3 and 6.

Martin Laboratory of Neuropathology, Born Bunge Foundation (BBS) and Department of Medicine, University of Antwerp (UIA), Antwerpen, Belgium  Introduction Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) represents a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders of the peripheral nervous system (Dyck et al. 1993). C M T type 1 (CMT1) disease or H M S N type I is the most frequent subtype characterized by progressive atrophy and paresis of distal limb muscles. CMT1 disease is mostly inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with an estimated prevalence between 5 and 40 per 100000 (Skre 1974; Kurtzke 1984). The major electrophysiological and neuropathological features are depressed or absent deep-tendon reflexes, pes cavus deformity, reduced median motor nerve conduction velocities (NCV) of less than 38 m/s, and segmental de- and remyelination with onion-bulb formation on peripheral nerve biopsy. A major locus for autosomal dominant CMT1 disease (designated CMT1A) was identified on chromosome 17pl 1.2 on the basis of cosegregation of CMT1 disease with a duplication of 1.5 Mb (Lupski et al. 1991; Raeymaekers et al. 1991, 1992). The CMT1A duplication comprises the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP-22) gene (Patel et al. 1992; Valentijn et al. 1992a; Timmerman et al. 1992; Matsunami et al. 1992), and is present in 6 8 % - 8 2 . 5 % of CMT1 families (Wise et al. 1993; Nelis et al. 1992; unpublished results). The majority of the genetically sporadic C M T I patients also have the CMT1A duplication (Hoogendijk et al. 1992; Palau et al. 1993). A few CMT1 families have been reported with a point mutation in the PMP-22 gene, providing further evidence that PMP-22 is involved in CMT1 pathogenesis (Valentijn et al. 1992b; Roa et al. 1993a; Nelis et al. 1994a). A minor autosomal dominant CMT1 locus (designated CMT1B) has been assigned by linkage analyses to chromosome lq21-q23 (Bird et al. 1982; Lebo et al. 1991). The CMT1B locus was shown to coincide with the gene for the major peripheral myelin protein P0 on the basis of cosegregation of mutations in the P0 gene with CMT1B  654 disease ( H a y a s a k a et al. 1993a, b, c; H i m o r o et al. 1993; K u l k e n s et al. 1993; Nelis et al. 1994b). So far, all k n o w n mutations are localized in exons 2 and 3 o f the P0 gene and involve a single a m i n o acid change, i.e. a substitution or deletion in the extracellular d o m a i n o f P0-  Materials and methods Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis The coding region of the PMP-22 gene was amplified using primers published by Roa et al. (1993a). The coding region of the P0 gene was amplified using six primer sets (Table 1). The standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out in a 25 btl volume containing 100 ng genomic DNA template and 25 pmole of each oligodeoxynucleotide primer in the presence of (ot32p)dCTP (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). They were processed through 22 cycles of 1 min at 94~ 1.5 rain at the appropriate annealing temperature (P0: Ta, Table 1) (PMP-22: 60~ for exons 1 and 4, 58~ for exon 2, 64~ for exon 3), and 2min at 72~ Samples (5 btl) of amplified DNA were mixed with 3 btl formamide sample buffer and, alter denaturation for 2 min at 100~ subjected to electrophoresis on a 1 x HydroLink MDE (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NY) gel at 15W for 18-20 hr. Gels were vacuum dried and autoradiographed for 4 h at 70~ We used DNA samples from patients with a PMP-22 mutation in exon 1 (Leul6Pro; Valentijn et al. 1992b), exon 3 (Ser79Cys; Roa et al. 1993a) and exon 4 (Thr118Met; Roa et al. 1993b), and a P0 mutation in exon 2 (ASer34; Kulkens et al. 1993) as positive controls in the Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) analysis.  Patient selection B l o o d s a m p l e s for D N A extraction were obtained from C M T patients and their family m e m b e r s , either following a "call for patients" in several European scientific j o u r n a l s (CMT-series) or after referral for D N A diagnostic purposes (PN-series). All patients were analysed for the presence o f the C M T 1 A duplication b y Southern blot hybridization o f Mspl-digested D N A with the markers p V A W 4 0 9 R 3 a (D 17S 122) and pEW401 (D 17S61 ) (Raeym a e k e r s et al. 1992) and pulsed field gel electrophoresis o f FspI-digested D N A h y b r i d i z e d with p V A W 4 0 9 R 3 a (D17S 122) ( T i m m e r m a n et al. 1992). A m o n g the non-duplicated patients, 23 were selected for mutation screening o f candidate myelin genes, since their clinical phenotype was c o m p a t i b l e with CMT1 disease. In 15 of these cases, C M T 1 disease was c o n f i r m e d by e l e c t r o p h y s i o l o g i c a l examination showing reduced NCV. Seven patients were isolated cases, however, in six o f them, neither the parents nor the siblings were clinically evaluated, so that genetic transmission o f the disease cannot be excluded. Twelve cases were familial, i.e. multiple patients were present in the p e d i g r e e and, in nine o f them, the disease was autosoreal d o m i n a n t l y inherited. In four cases, no or i n c o m p l e t e information regarding f a m i l y history was available.  Mutation analysis  Sequence analysis For manual sequencing, we used a biotinylated primer in the PCR amplification and the PCR product was bound to streptavidincoated magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). After denaturation, the single-stranded DNA was sequenced using the Sequenase kit version 2.0 (US Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH). For automated sequencing, we used the Prism Sequenase Terminator Double Stranded Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The electrophoresis and analysis were performed on a 373A DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

The Tyr154stop and the Tyrl 8 l stop mutations destroy a RsaI recognition site, allowing the detection of these mutations by restriction enzyme digestion of the exon 4 PCR fragment (data not shown). The different P0 mutations are depicted in Fig. 1. None of the P0 mutations was detected in 30 unrelated control individuals when their DNA was analysed by SSCP under the same conditions that allowed the detection of the P0 mutations, indicating that these mutations are pathogenic for CMT1 disease.

Circles represent missense mutations, squares represent nonsense mutations. The glycosylation site is indicated as  We subsequently analyzed the P0 gene for the presence of mutations using SSCP and direct sequencing analysis. On the basis of the intron-exon boundaries of the P0 gene (Pham-Dinh et al. 1993; Nelis et al. 1994b) we designed intronic primers for PCR amplification of each of the six exons. The primer sequences and PCR conditions are listed in Table 1. The primers can be used for both PCRSSCP analysis and direct PCR sequencing of genomic DNA. In six of the 23 unrelated non-duplicated CMT 1 patients, sequence variations were detected in, respectively, exons 2, 3, 4 and 6 of the P0 gene.  P0 mutations In patient PN-24.1, the SSCP analysis of exon 2 of the P0 gene showed an altered mobility of the PCR fragment. Sequence analysis of exon 2 in this patient revealed a C to T base change at position 277 (numbering according to Hayasaka et al. 1991), resulting in an amino acid substitution of Ser to Leu at codon 78. SSCP analysis indicated that the Ser78Leu mutation was also present in the DNA of the affected sister of the PN-24.1 patient. Patient CMT-47.1 produced an altered SSCP pattern of exon 3 of the P0 gene and sequencing revealed a base change of G to A at position 444, resulting in an amino acid substitution of Asp by Asn at codon 134. By SSCP analysis, the Asp134Asn mutation was shown to be present in four other available patients of family CMT-47, indicating that the mutation segregates with the disease. An altered SSCP pattern in exon 4 of the P0 gene was detected in patients PN-35.2 and PN-78.1. Sequencing of exon 4 in these patients revealed a single base change at positions 587 and 506, respectively. The mutations lead to the replacement of the codons Tyrl81 and Tyr154 by a stop codon. The Tyrl81stop mutation was detected in the affected mother of patient PN-35.2 but not in the un-  An altered SSCP pattern of exon 3 and exon 6 was observed in two of the 23 unrelated CMT1 patients and subsequent sequence analysis illustrated that these patients carried silent mutations in the P0 gene. In patient CMTR1, the exon 3 SSCP pattern resulted from a mutation of G to A at position 320, which does not change the Val residue at codon 92. All 11 CMT-R family members who were available for DNA testing were analysed for the mutation by SSCP analysis. As expected, the mutation, although inherited in a Mendelian fashion, did not segregate with the disease. The altered SSCP pattern of exon 6 in patient CMT-70.2, resulted from a C to T mutation at position 728 and did not change the Ser at codon 228. Moreover, in this case, the mutation did not segregate with CMT1 disease. The exon 6 polymorphism created a RsaI recognition site allowing the detection of the polymorphism at position 728 by restriction enzyme digestion of the PCR fragment comprising the exon 6 sequence (data not shown). The frequency of the P0 polymorphisms was estimated by SSCP analysis of the respective exons in unrelated control individuals without a CMT phenotype. The exon 3 polymorphism could not be detected in 30 control individuals indicating that it is an extremely rare polymorphism with an estimated frequency of 1.6%. The exon 6 polymorphism, however, was detected in four out of 60 control individuals, resulting in an overall allele frequency of 4.1%.  Discussion We screened genomic DNA of 23 unrelated non-duplicated CMT1 patients for mutations in the coding regions of the PMP-22 and P0 genes. No alteration in the SSCP pattern of the four exons of PMP-22 were observed in any of the patients. Although the SSCP results suggest that mutations in the PMP-22 gene in these patients are highly unlikely, we cannot exclude that mutations may be present that are not visible under the conditions used (Nelis et al. 1994a). Altered SSCP patterns of the P0 gene were detected in six patients and direct PCR sequencing identified six new single base changes: two missense mutations in,  656 T a b l e 2 Overview of P0 mutations and polymorphisms Exon  Family  Codon  Mutation  Amino acid substitution  2 3  PN-24 CMT-R CMT-47 PN-78 PN-35 CMT-70  78 92 134 154 181 228  TCG--+TTG GTG--+GTA GAC---->AAC TAC-->TAA TAC--+TAG AGC-+AGT  Ser--+Leu Val-~Val Asp~Asn Tyr-+stop Tyr-gstop Ser--+Ser  4 6  respectively, exons 2 and 3, two nonsense mutations in exon 4 and two silent mutations or polymorphisms in, respectively, exons 3 and 6. An overview of these P0 mutations and polymorphisms is given in Table 2 and the location of the P0 mutations is depicted in Fig. 1. All four mutations involve amino acids that are conserved in P0 among such different species as human (Hayasaka et al. 1991), bovine (Sakamoto et al. 1987), rat (Lemke and Axel 1985) and mouse (You et al. 1991). The mutations were found in familial CMTI patients of whom two had proven autosomal dominant CMTI disease (CMT-47 and PN-35). In the latter two CMTI cases, the mutation segregated with the disease in the family. The two polymorphisms in exons 3 and 6, respectively, were found in autosomal dominant CMTI patients (CMT-R and CMT-70) but did not segregate with the disease in the family. The exon 6 polymorphism was also detected in unrelated control individuals with no CMT1 phenotype; an overall allele frequency of 4.1% was calculated. The gene for the major peripheral myelin protein P0, localized in the l q21.3-q23 region in close proximity to the FcyRII gene (Pham-Dinh et al. 1993), was identified as the CMT1B gene on the basis of the cosegregation of mutations with CMT1B disease (Hayasaka et al. 1993a, b, c; Himoro et al. 1993; Kulkens et al. 1993; Nelis et al. 1994b). P0 is the most abundant protein in peripheral myelin and its expression is restricted to myelinating Schwann cells (Lemke and Axel 1985; Greenfield et al. 1973; Filbin et al. 1993). P0 is an integral membrane glycoprotein of 28 kDa that functions as a structural element in the compaction of myelin. So far, all seven mutations reported in CMTI B patients are distinct mutations located in exons 2 or 3 coding for the extracellular domain of P0. We also found two new mutations in, respectively, exons 2 and 3 (Fig. 1, Table 2). The extracellular domain shows similarity to members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It has been hypothesized that this domain takes part in myelin compaction by homophilic interaction. The influence of these mutations on P0 functioning is not known. It is possible that the mutation affects the homophilic interaction and therefore disturbs myelin compaction. Another possibility is that the mutated P0 protein is not properly inserted into the Schwann cell membrane and that, if it remains intracellular, it is metabolically toxic to the Schwann cell. The two other mutations that we found are located in exon 4 and, since both mutations are nonsense mutations,  they cause early termination of the translation resulting in an aberrant P0 protein (Fig. 1, Table 2). The Tyr154stop mutation involves the first codon of the transmembrane domain of P0. The transmembrane and intracellular domains will therefore be completely deleted. The Tyrl81stop mutation is localized in the cytoplasmic domain of P0 and will result in a deletion of the cytoplasmic domain. The intracellular domain may function as a membrane adhesion molecule by electrostatic interaction with acidic lipids or via protein-protein interactions (Lemke and Axel 1985). Therefore, this domain may also be important for the compaction of myelin. Autosomal dominant CMT1 is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. In the majority of CMT1 patients, a duplication of 1.5 Mb on chromosome 17pl 1.2 is present comprising the PMP-22 gene. In non-duplicated CMT1 patients, three single base mutations in the PMP-22 gene have been described whereas seven mutations have been detected in the P0 gene at lq21.3-q23. In this study, SSCP analysis identified a pathogenic mutation in the P{~gene in four out of 23 (17%) CMT1 patients, whereas no mutation was found in the PMP-22 gene. These data suggest that mutations in the P0 gene are more frequent than PMP-22 mutations. However, DNA data on a larger number of CMTI patients will be needed in order to obtain an accurate estimate of the frequency of the different mutations in CMT1 disease. Moreover, if a larger number of CMTI patients with a mutation is available, a correlation can be made between the clinical expression of the disease and a particular CMT1 mutation. Nevertheless, for DNA diagnostic purposes, it is worthwhile to test the non-duplicated C M T I patients first for mutations in the P0 gene using the SSCP conditions presented in this study.

We performed a rapid mutation screening of the PMP-22 and P0 genes in non-duplicated CMT1 patients by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by direct polymerase chain reaction sequencing of genomic DNA.

KEY WORDS: Adrenoleukodystrophy,  ALD, Mutation detection, SSSCP, lmmunofluorescence  INTRODUCTION  X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that involves mainly the adrenal cortex, nervous system white matter and testis (Moser et al., 1994). The principal biochemical abnormality is the accumulation of saturated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA), particularly hexacosanoic acid, C26:O (Igarashi et al., 1976). This accumulation is primarily the result of their impaired degradation in peroxisomes due to reduced activity of the peroxisomal VLCFA Coenzyme A synthetase (VLCS) (Lazo et al., 1989; Wanders, et al., 1988). The ALD gene was mapped to Xq28 in 1981 (Migeon et al., 1981) and a candidate gene was isolated by positional cloning in 1993 (Mosser et al., 1993). Surprisingly, the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein (ALDP) corresponding to the ALD gene suggests 8 1995 WILEY-USS, MC.  that it is not the VLCS itself, but rather is a member of a super-family of transmembrane transporters, the ATP binding cassette ( A X ) proteins (Hyde et al., 1990) or traffic ATPases (Mimura et al., 1991). The ABC transporter super-family includes more than 30 known proteins that share significant sequence homology and have a similar overall structure (Higgins et al., 1988). All members of the ABC family whose function is known are transmembrane channel proteins that participate in the transport of ligands ranging from ions to  Received October 7. 1994,accepted March 14, 1995. *To whom reprint requestdcorrespondence should be addressed.  ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY GENE  proteins. The striking sequence similarity among ABC proteins suggests that they are likely to have common mechanistic features. The best studied eukaryotic ABC proteins are the mammalian P-glycoprotein (multiple drug resistance, MDR (Chen e t al., 1986), the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (Riordan e t al., 1989), and the product of the yeast STE6 gene (Kuchler et al., 1989; McGrath et al., 1989). These molecules are comprised of two homologous halves, each with six predicted membrane spanning regions and a putative nucleotide binding fold (NBF). Two highly conserved sequences (Walker A and B) have been identified at the borders of each NBF (Walker et al., 1982). Certain ABC proteins, including the bacterial hemolysin transporter, HlyB (Felmlee e t al., 1985; Mackman et al., 1986) and the human 70Kd peroxisomal protein, PMP70, (Gartner et al., 1992) are “halftransporter” versions with a single set of six transmembrane regions and a single NBF domain. In other ABC transporters, including the bacterial nutrient permeases, the membrane spanning regions and the NBF domains are on separate polypeptides (Ames et al., 1986; Hyde et al., 1990). ALDP is a “half-transporter” with striking sequence similarity to PMP7O (Mosser et al., 1993). The gene, comprised of 10 exons, spans approximately 21 Kb of genomic sequence and encodes a predicted mRNA with an open reading frame of 2,235 bases encoding a protein of 745 amino acids (Sarde et al., 1994). This gene was initially suggested as a candidate for ALD on the bases of its map position within Xq28, its sequence similarity with PMP70 and the occurrence of large deletions in 7% of the initial population of ALD patients screened (Mosser et al., 1993). Subsequently, mutations in the ALD gene have been described in individual ALD patients (Uchiyama et al., 1994; Cartier et al., 1993; Contreras et al., 1994; Fanen et al., 1994) and immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that ALDP is indeed associated with the peroxisomal membrane (Mosser et al., 1994). In this paper we examine 112 unrelated ALD patients for large deletions and systematically determine the mutations in 25 unrelated ALD probands whose ALD genes lack gross alterations. The identification of mutations in 24 of these patients provides additional evidence linking this gene with ALD. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients The subjects included in this study were selected from more than 1200 patients with X-linked ALD  105  who have been diagnosed at the Kennedy Krieger Institute as part of a national screening program. Diagnosis was based on clinical criteria (Moser et al., 1994) and the demonstration of abnormally increased levels of VLCFA in plasma or cultured skin fibroblasts (Moser et al., 1991; Moser et al., 1981). Patients were classified as cerebral ALD (CER: including childhood, adolescent and adult forms), adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN: including cases with subsequent cerebral involvement) and Addison’s only (ADD) (Moser et al., 1994; Moser et al., 1992; Moser et al., 1989). We initially screened 112 unrelated patients and 40 normal individuals for major deletions and insertions in the ALD gene. Subsequently, 25 apparently intact ALD genes, as judged by Southern blot analysis, were subjected to detailed mutational analysis. Table 2 lists their age, ethnic background, phenotype, and kindred phenotypes. Isolation of Nucleic Acids Genomic DNA from whole blood, EBV transformed lymphoblasts or fibroblasts and plasmid DNA from recombinant clones containing partial cDNAs of ALDP, Ex13 and Ex3 (Mosser et al., 1993), and the recombinant clone for the microsatellite locus, DXS52, at Xq28 (St14) were isolated by standard procedures (Sambrook et al.,  1989). Southern Blot Analysis Genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI, Hind111 or BamHI according to the conditions described by the supplier (Gibco-BRL: Gaithersburg, MD) with addition of BSA and spermidine to final concentrations of 100 Fgiml and 4 mM, respectively. The resulting DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes (Genescreen Plus, DuPont: Wilmington, DE) in 0.4M NaOH and probed with partial cDNA clones Ex13 and Ex3 (Mosser et al., 1993). The probes were labeled by random primer extension using [321‘]-dCTP (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1984) to a specific activity of 2-3 x lo8 c p d p g . Filter hybridization and washing followed the manufacturers’ suggestions. When necessary to reduce filter background or the presence of cross reacting DNA fragments the filters were subjected to two washes in 0.1 x SSC, 1% SDS at 65°C for 30 min each. The filters were exposed to Kodak X-Omat film with intensifying screens at -80°C for one to six days. When a change in a restriction fragment was observed indicating a deletion, additional hybridizations  106  KOKETAL.  were performed using probes specific for each exon. PCR Primers used for amplifying genomic ALD sequences were designed according to the genomic sequence of the ALD gene (Sarde et al., 1994). They are listed in Table 1 together with the size of the amplified fragment. The regions amplified by this set of primers included the presumptive promoter region, extending 657 BP 5' to the ATG initiation codon, all 10 exons and flanking intronic sequences, including the splicing branch point and 100-150 BP of the untranslated 3' sequence. PCR amplifications were performed in an Ericomp programmable thermal cycler in a volume of 50 p1 using Ampliwax (Perkin-Elmer Cetus: Foster City, C A ) in order to achieve a hot start. Except where noted, 100 ng of genomic DNA was amplified with the concentration of each primer at 500 nM and each deoxynucleotide at 0.5 mM. The promoter region and exon 1 of the ALd gene have a very high GC content and amplify poorly with Taq polymerase. T h e promoter fragments were amplified in reaction mixtures that consisted of 2 mM MgCl,, 0.1 mM 7deaza2'GTP, 0.1 mM dGTP, 0.2 mM dATP, dCTP, TTP, 0.1% gelatin, 1% DMSO, and 2.5 U of the Stoffel fragment of DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus: Foster City, CA). The PCR thermal cycle was: initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min; 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 63°C for 40 sec and 72°C for 2 min with a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. Exon 1 is approximately 1.5 kb in length and was amplified in 7 overlapping segments in order to generate fragments appropriate for mutational analysis. The reaction mixture was 2.5 mM MgCl,, 20% sucrose and 2.5 units of the Stoffel fragment of DNA polymerase. For thermal cycling the template was first denatured at 95°C fr 3 min followed by repeated denaturation at 94" for 1 min, annealing at 68" for 1 min and extension at 72" for 2 min with a final extension at 72" for 7 min. To improve the yield of this amplification the initial amplification of 35 cycles was followed by a 16 cycle second amplification with a nested primer. Exons 2 through 6 were amplified in a reaction mixture containing 1.25 units of recombinant Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus: Foster City, C A ) and a final concentration of 1.5 mM MgC1,. Following an initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, thermal cycling was for 28 cycles with denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 60°C (exons  2,4,6) or 65°C (exons 3,5) for 1 min, extension at 72" for 2 min with a final extension for 7 min. All primers designed for examining exons 7 through 10, both intronic and exonic, amplified a set of autosomal sequences as well as those from the ALD gene on the X chromosome. Thus, the first step in the analysis of exons 7-10 was the generation of an X-specific 4 Kb fragment that extended from the X-specific 5' primer of exon 6 to a 3' primer in exon 10. This long range PCR was accomplished using 1 pM of each primer, 1 mM of each deoxynucleotide, 2.4 mM Mg(OAc),, 20 mM Tricine (pH 8.7), 80 mM KOAc, 1% DMSO, 10% glycerol and 2.5 units of T t h DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus: Foster City, CA) plus 0.025 units of Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs: Beverly, MA). Thermal cycling was: initial denaturation at 94°C for 20 sec then 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 sec, annealing at 63°C for 1 min, extension at 72°C for 5 min and a final extension at 72°C for 15 min. Nested PCR reactions were performed with intronic primers specific for each of the exons using 0.5 p1 of the initial PCR product and the same conditions established for exon 2 with the number of cycles reduced to  18. Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) Analysis This analysis was modified from the procedure described by Orita et al. (Orita e t al., 1989a; Orita e t al., 1989b). In brief, 5 to 10 p1 of alkali denatured PCR product was loaded onto a 16 x 20 cm gel containing 0.75 X MDE (AT Biochem: Malvern, PA) prepared in 1X TBE according to the manufacturers' instructions. Samples were fractionated using a vertical gel electrophoresis system (Gibco-BRL: Gaithersburg, MD) at both 4" and 22°C. Gels were stained with silver nitrate (Bassam e t al., 1991) and analyzed for migrational conformers. The migration patterns obtained with patient DNA were always compared with the patterns achieved with DNA from normal individuals and with DNA from a somatic hybrid cell, AHA 1l a , in which the only human chromosome is the X, to confirm that the fragments were from the X-chromosome. DNA Sequence Analysis Variant SSCP migration confomers were sequenced in both directions using a dsDNA cycle sequencing system (Gibco-BRL: Gaithersburg, MD), with one labeled primer. The resulting sequence was compared with the sequence obtained  ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY GENE  with DNA from a normal individual and to the published cDNA sequence (Mosser et al., 1993). Possible mutations were confirmed by analysis of a second independent PCR reaction, either by sequence determination or by restriction endonuclease analysis when the putative mutation altered a restriction site. In patients where no SSCP migration variant was detected the entire gene was sequenced.  DXS52 (St14) Genotype Analysis  To establish that certain X-chromosomes with the same mutation had separate origins, alleles at the highly variable DXS52 locus were determined. This locus is a mini-satellite that is closely linked to the ALD locus and is frequently used for pedigree analysis of ALD (Aubourg e t al., 1978). Southern blots of genomic DNA digested with Taq I were hybridized with a recombinant probe, St14, for the locus. St14 was provided by J. Nathans. Hybridization was as described above. Antibodies  A synthetic peptide was generated that corresponds to the predicted amino acid residues 728745 in ALDP. This region was chosen because it was predicted to have a high probability of surface exposure, high antigenicity (MacVector, IBI: New Haven, CT) and no similarity with PMP70. The synthetic peptide was coupled to bovine serum albumin with the bifunctional cross-linking agent Bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate (BS3; Pierce). Antiserum was raised in rabbits at Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA). Antiserum to this peptide was used in immunofluorescence experiments on human primary fibroblasts. Cells were fixed, permeabilized with Triton X-100 and incubated for 1 hour with the anti-peptide antiserum and then with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson Immuno Research: Westgrove, PA) (Harlow and Lane, 1988); the cells were examined by Fluorescence microscopy using Leitz Aristoplan Microscope. For double-label immuno-f luorescence studies, anti-human catalase antibody raised in sheep (Jackson Immuno Research) was included with the antiALDP peptide antiserum and was detected with LRSC-conjugated anti-sheep IgG antibody (Jackson Immuno Research).  RESULTS Southern Blot Analysis  To detect major changes in the genomic structure of the ALD gene, we studied DNA from 112 unrelated ALD patients and 60 X-chromosomes  107  from normal individuals. EcoRI, Hind111 and BamHI digests of genomic DNA were probed with partial ALDP cDNA clones (Ex13 and Ex3) that together span exons 2 through 9 (Mosser et al., 1993). Both of these probes detect several DNA fragments in each digest, only some of which are from the X-linked ALD locus. The cross reacting fragments remained after stringent washing of the filters. The identity of the X-chromosome fragments was determined by comparison to the pattern of hybridizing bands obtained with DNA from a somatic hybrid cell line (AHA1l a ) in which the only human chromosome is the X. N o restriction fragment size changes were observed in the controls. In four patients (41112 = 3.6%) deletions affecting the 3’ region of the gene were observed. The deletions are diagrammed in Fig. 1. Their clinical and pedigree information is included in Table 2. The 3’ end of the deletion was beyond the end of the gene in each case and was not determined. No deletions altering exons 1 or 2, that code for the putative transmembrane segments of ALDP, were detected. The presence and absence of the exons indicated in Figure 1 were confirmed by hybridization with PCR probes specific for each exon. The frequency and pattern of deletions in this population of patients are similar to those described in the initial population examined (Mosser et al., 1993).  SSCP Analysis A detailed mutational analysis was undertaken in 25 of the 108 unrelated probands that had intact ALD genes by Southern blot analysis. The remaining probands from the original group of 112 have not yet been examined. Clinical and pedigree information on these individuals is included in Table 2 together with results of the mutation study. One patient was adopted. Seven of the others were the only known affected individuals in their kindred. These included all three ALD phenotypes. Patient 23 had a new mutation since the mutation was not present in his mother. The remaining patients were members of kindreds with multiple affected individuals. In three instances all had AMN but the other kindreds had a mixture of phenotypes (see Table 2). The plasma levels of VLCFA ((2260) are not correlated with either the ALD phenotype or the type or position of the mutation. In order to minimize the amount of DNA sequencing required to identify mutations, all patient DNA was initially examined by SSCP analysis of ALD specific PCR fragments to determine the approximate location of possible mutations.  108  KOKETAL.

PCR amplification of exons 7-10 individually from genomic DNA, using either exonic or intronic primers, gave single bands of the expected sizes when assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis. However, when these PCR products were assayed by SSCP several bands were observed suggesting that both exonic and intronic primers were amplifying autosomal sequences in addition to those of the X-linked ALD gene. This was confirmed by SSCP analysis of exons 7 through 10 amplified from AHAl l a where a single pair of bands from the X-chromosome was detected (Fig. 2). Thus, the apparent single PCR fragment generated from genomic DNA is a mixture of frag-  ments from several chromosomes. There is remarkable sequence identity (>97%) among the X-chromosome and autosomal sequences (data not shown). In order to detect mutations in this region of the ALD gene, we first amplified a 4Kb X-specific PCR fragment using an X-specific primer in exon 6 and a reverse primer in exon 10. Nested primers specific for each exon were then used to amplify PCR fragments for SSCP analysis and subsequent DNA sequencing if appropriate. These nested PCR products for exons 7 through 10 were X-specific as judged by comparison with results obtained with DNA from AHAl la. A comparison of the SSCP patterns obtained by direct and nested PCR amplification of exon 7 is shown in Figure 2. No SSCP migration variants were observed with  109  ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY GENE TABLE 2.

SSCP migrational conformers were detected in all but 3 of the 25 ALD patients examined, approximately 90%. In addition a silent nucleotide change present in one of the patients also generated a SSCP variant. An example of SSCP variants obtained with exon 5 is shown in Figure 3. ALD Mutations Examples of the DNA sequence changes resulting in ALD mutations are shown in Figure 4. All of the ALD mutations determined in this study are listed in Table 2 and diagrammed in Figure 5. Mutations were found widely distributed through the gene but none were detected in the promoter region, in the untranslated part of the predicted mRNA or in exons 2, 4 and 10. Fourteen single nucleotide substitutions were found. One was a G to A change at the splice donor site of exon 3, one resulted in a stop codon in exon 5, one was a synonomous change, and the remainder were all missense mutations. One patient had two single bp  substitutions, one producing a silent mutation and the other a missense mutation. Frameshift mutations were detected in 10 patients. Unexpectedly, seven of these were an identical AG deletion at nucleotide position 1415/16 in exon 5 (Figure 6). Five AG deletions were detected in an initial screen of 22 ALD patients. Subsequently, we examined another 35 of the original probands by SSCP for mutations in exon 5. We found two additional cases with the AG deletion and one patient with an adjacent AA deletion. Thus, 7 of 57 patients (approximately 12%) examined in this study have an identical AG deletion in exon 5 and 2 additional patients (nos. 10 and 11) also have a small insertion or deletion in the same region. As indicated in Table 2, these patients have different ethnic backgrounds. They also have distinguishable X-chromosomes as judged by the presence of different DXS52 alleles (data not shown). Interestingly, each of the three ALD phenotypes is present among the individuals with this dinucleotide deletion.  110  KOKETAL.  FIGURE 3.

The left lane shows the native PCR fragment generated from genomic DNA assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Lane 1 shows the SSCP profile of the genomic exon 7 PCR fragment. Lane 2 shows the SSCP profile of exon 7 amplified from a somatic cell hybrid in which the only human chromosome is the X. Lane 3 shows the SSCP profile of the X-specific nested PCR products amplified from the X-specific long-range PCR fragment. Lane 4 is a negative control without template.  Three ALD patients had normal SSCP patterns for all regions of the gene examined. The entire ALD gene was sequenced in each patient, including the promoter region from -657 to the ATG initiation codon, each exon and 30 to 100 bp of their flanking intronic sequence, including each of the splice branch points, and 300 bp of the 3’ untranslated portion of exon 10. In one, patient no. 9, a nonsense mutation was found. N o mutation was found in the other two patients. It should be noted that DNA sequnce analysis of exon 1 from an ALD gene derived from a cosmid clone and from normal and patient genes isolated from the collection at the Kennedy Krieger Institute consistently differed from the published sequence (Mosser et al., 1993). In these samples nucleotide 368 was a T rather than a C resulting in an amino acid change, A123V, that presumably is a normal variant.  Anti-serum raised against a synthetic peptide predicted from the sequence of the ALD gene was used to examine fibroblasts from a normal individuals and 3 ALD patients for the presence and subcellular distribution of ALDP. The results are shown in Fig. 7. In panel A the expected punctate staining of peroxisomes (Gould et al., 1989) is seen with anti ALDP antibody. Panel B shows the same cells as panel A reacted simultaneously with anti-catalase antibody. T h e identity of punctate staining seen with the two antibodies confirms that this anti-ALDP antibody recognizes peroxisomes and is consistent with the localization of ALDP to the peroxisome. Panel C shows the reaction of anti-ALDP antibody with fibroblasts from a normal subject. Panel D shows a negative reaction obtained with fibroblasts from a patient (Table 2, no. 29) with a major ALD deletion. Panels E and F show fibroblasts from the patients without detectable ALD mutations. The patient shown in panel F (Table 2, no. 24) is clearly deficient for ALDP associated with peroxisomes while the patient in panel E (Table 2, no. 25) has a normal pattern of ALDP antibody staining. DISCUSSION We have undertaken a detailed mutational analysis of the ALD gene in 25 unrelated ALD patients. The most significant observation is that the vast majority of patients with X-linked ALD have mutations in the ALD gene. In a series of 112 unrelated ALD patients we confirmed the earlier results of Mosser e t al. (Mosser et al., 1993) that a small fraction of ALD patients (3.6% in this study)  ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY GENE  Representative DNA sequences comparing normal and mutant ALD genes. Patient 7 has a G + A transition at nucleotide 1166 causing a missense mutation, R389H. Patient 8 has a G --z A transition at nucleotide 1224, changing the 3’ splice site of exon 3. Patient 22 has a G + A transition  111  at nucleotide 1850resulting in the substitution of histidine for a highly conserved arginine in the ATP binding domain, R617H. Patient 6 has a G + T transversion at nucleotide 829 resulting in a G277W mutation.  FIGURE 4.

Each deletion was unique but all included the ATP binding domain. The relationship of this gene, with its presumed transport function, to the biochemical abnormality of ALD, characterized by elevated levels of VLCFA due to a failure of their beta-oxidation in peroxisomes, is uncertain. In principle, mutational anal-  ysis of the gene could provide insights into its function. In this survey of 25 unrelated X-linked ALD patients with intact ALD genes, we identified mutations in 24. Approximately 88% (22125) were detected by SSCP.

The DNA sequence from a normal subject is shown on the right and that from patient 12 on the left. The position of the dinucleotide deletion in patient 12 is indicated by the arrow on the left. The positions of the nucleotides deleted from normal DNA are indicated by the arrows on the right.  FIGURE 6. DNA  With the exception of the seven patients with the AG dinucleotide deletion in exon 5, each patient had a unique mutation. Thus no single recurrent mutation suggesting an important functional domain was observed. T h e identified mutations included one presumptive splice site mutation, one nonsense mutation and a silent mutation. The remainder of the mutations were either missense or frameshift changes. All of these mutations occurred within the coding region of the gene. We did not find mutations in the promoter region 5’ to the translation start codon, in the untranslated portion of the last exon or in intronic sequences. An intronic mutation can be inferred in patient no. 24 (see below) but has not yet been demonstrated. The frameshift mutations all result in premature termination and thus would lack a functional protein. In most instances the putative missense mutations have been identified solely o n the basis of predicted amino acid substitutions and need to be confirmed by functional studies. Missense mutations accounted for 44% (11/25) of the ALD patients examined in detail. This is comparable to the situation in the cystic fibrosis gene (CFTR) where missense mutations are about 50% of the total (Tsui, 1992). Frameshift mutations, which include one single nucleotide insertion and 9 dinucleotide deletions, accounted for 40% of the observed ALD sequence changes in this group of ALD patients. Missense mutations should be the most informative for inferring functional domains in the protein. Five missense mutations were found in re-  Analysis of ALDP in fibroblasts. Panels A and B show double-label indirect immunofluorescence of control human fibroblasts with anti-ALDPand anti-catalase antibodies. Fibroblasts were permeabilized with Triton X-100 and incubated with both antibodies as described in methods. Panel A shows detection of ALDP with FITC-conjugated antirabbit antibody and Panel B detection of catalase with LRSC-conjugated anti-sheep antibody. The punctate immunofluorescence patterns are identical, indicating that the anti-ALDP antibody recognizes a peroxisomal protein. Panel C and D compares the immunofluorescence patterns of fibroblasts from a normal subject (C) and a patient (29) with a major ALD gene deletion demonstrating the antibody is specific for ALDP. Panels E and F display the immunofluorescence patterns in fibroblasts from 2 ALD patients (25and 24, respectively) in which mutations were not detected. FIGURE 7.  gions of exon 1 that code for 4 of the presumed transmembrane segments of this postulated transmembrane transport protein. Two of these are within the predicted membrane spanning segment (Patients 1 and 2) and one (Patient 3 ) is at the edge of such a segment. These mutations result in a change of charge and polarity (see Table 2). T h e transmembrane region has a role in determining the specificity of a transporter (Higgins, 1992) and thus changing the charge or polarity of the amino acid residue could interfere with the specificity of the transporter. In the CFTR gene, it was found that many mutations that affect the transmembrane domains and their neighboring sequences involve changes of charge or polarity (Tsui, 1992). Four mutations were found within the ATP bind-  ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY GENE  ing domain, one in Walker A (G512S), one in Walker B (R617H), one in the highly conserved sequence preceding Walker B (S606L), and one in the middle of the domain. In most instances the ALDP missense mutations correspond to residues that are conserved between ALD and human PMP70 (Gartner et al., 1992). The mutations in Walker A and B motifs and the conserved sequence affect amino acids that are invariant among ABC transporters and that are sites of CFTR mutations (Tsui, 1992, Cutting et al., 1990; Kerem et al. 1990; Ferec et al., 1992). The mutation in patient no. 23 involves an amino acid residue that is also highly conserved among ABC proteins. The remainder of the missense mutations were found in regions outside of the known conserved functional domains of this family of proteins. Some caution must be exercised in the functional interpretation of these mutations. First, about 64% of the missense mutations can be explained by deamination of methylcytosine in CpG dinucleotides even though CpG dinucleotides represent less than 6% of the nucleotides in the translated portion of the gene. These mutations are common and account for about 35% of all single bp substitutions that cause human genetic disease (Cooper and Youssoufian, 1988). The most frequent amino acid substitution found in this series involves arginine. Because arginine is a charged amino acid, mutations that result in a charge change at these positions could affect function and/or conformation. However, five of the six substitutions at arginine residues can be explained by C to T or G to A transitions and may be a reflection of the CpG mutational hot spot. In addition, many missense mutations in the ALD gene result in an unstable protein that is degraded (Watkins, manuscript submitted). Since peroxisome structure is normal in patients with X-linked ALD, it can be inferred that ALDP is not required for normal biogenesis or stability of peroxisomes. However, ALDP is clearly associated with peroxisomes, appears to be required for normal beta-oxidation of VLCFA and must contain residues that are important for its interaction with peroxisomes. Mutations that weaken the interaction of ALDP with peroxisomes might result in the degradation of the unbound protein. Direct functional analysis of potential missense mutations is required before conclusions about the association of specific mutations with function can be drawn. A small region of six nucleotides within exon 5 is particularly susceptible to small deletions and insertions. Among the 28 mutations described in  113  this study, nine were frameshift changes in this region: 1 A insertion, 1 AA deletion and 7 identical AG deletions. The AG deletions occurred in kindreds with different ethnic and geographical origin and included several different DXS52 markers. Thus it is likely that these are recurrent mutations and not the result of a founder effect. Similar results have been reported by Kemp et al. (1994). The origin of these mutations is not clear. Sequence motifs that are typically associated with slipped mispairing, hairpin stem and loop formation or misalignment due to direct or inverted repeats (Krawczak and Cooper, 1991) are present in this region but not in configurations that can easily account for the observed changes. The region of instability in exon 5 is preceded by a sequence, TGGATGTGGAAC, that is similar to a motif known to predispose to short deletions and insertions (Krawczak and Cooper, 1991) and is flanked by several repeats and possible palindromic motifs that could lead to complicated mispairing or structural changes leading to the observed changes. However, none of the hypothesized structures specifically expose the insertioddeletion region in any obvious way. The preponderance of evidence indicates that variations in the primary molecular defect in the ALD gene do not explain the striking phenotypic variability in ALD. We reported earlier that the co-occurrence of widely varying phenotypes within the same kindred and nuclear family is common (Moser e t a]., 1992). Mosser et al. (1993) previously noted that the childhood cerebral and “Addison only” phenotypes occurred in two brothers who were shown to have the same deletion. In confirmation of this point, mutations associated with each of the 3 phenotypic categories included in this study are distributed throughout the gene. In addition all 3 phenotypes are found among the patients with the identical AG deletion. Of particular interest are the 2 patients in which we were unable to determine a mutation within the region of the ALD gene examined. Patient 24 (Figure 7F) lacks detectable ALDP in fibroblasts and thus presumably has a mutation somewhere in his ALD gene that accounts for his lack of ALDP and thus his disease. The most likely explanation is a mutation leading to a new splice site and a down stream stop codon in a region of an intron that we did not examine. The cause of disease in the other patient (no. 25) is more obscure. He has elevated plasma levels of VLCFA (Table 2) and abnormal beta oxidation of VLCFA (data not shown). Yet, he has a normal distribution of ALDP in his fibro-  114  KOKETAL.  blasts (Figure 7, panel E) and no discernable mutation within the open reading frame of the ALD gene. Thus, his biochemical abnormality and disease may not be the result of altered ALDP function. While exon shuffling that retains open reading frames and splice sites but alters the protein structure or subtle quantitative variation in the production of ALDP cannot be ruled out at this time, the possibility of the involvement of a second gene as the primary genetic defect in ALD needs to be considered. Finally, confirmation that the ALD gene is defective in the vast majority of ALD patients has important practical implications. While the demonstration of abnormally elevated VLCFA has proven to be a reliable assay for the identification of affected males (Moser et al., 1994), including male fetuses (Moser et al., 1982), it is not fully satisfactory for the identification of heterozygotes because of the risk of false negative results (Moser et al., 1983). Linkage analysis with the DXS52 probe (ST14) can be used but only if appropriate family members are available and the probe is informative in the family at risk. In addition, carrier status cannot be predicted by linkage analysis in the case of a de novo mutation. The capacity for intragenic analysis will clearly improve the accuracy of heterozygote identification. When the kindred’s mutation is known this approach would replace the VLCFA assay as the preferred diagnostic tool in potential carriers of ALD.

They are tyrosine kinases which are activated by fibroblast growth factors binding extracellularly in the presence of proteoglycans and are expressed from embryo gastrulation onwards. The extracellular domain contains three immunoglobulin loops (Fig. 1). In FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3 the third immunoglobulin domain consists of two isoforms, Hlb and IIIc, which differ in their carboxyl ends and whose expression is cell-type specific. The two forms are created by alternative splicing in which one of two exons, (also referred to as exon Mb or IIIc *To whom correspondence should be addressed  in this paper) is spliced to an invariant upstream exon, IIIu (Fig. 1). The family of human FGFR genes contains four members which map to chromosome 8 (FGFR1), 10 (FGFR2), 4 (FGFR3) and 5 (FGFR4). Mutations associated with three members of the FGFR family have been found in human malformation syndromes. Mutation of a single nucleotide in the transmembrane domain of FGFR3 accounts for almost all cases of achondroplasia (3,4,28). Mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR1 have been found in the syndromes Crouzon, Pfeiffer, Apert and Jackson-Weiss (5-9), all of which involve craniosynostosis as a common feature. Changes in the digits vary from normal development in Crouzon syndrome, through broadening of the thumbs and great toes in Pfeiffer syndrome to severe syndactyly in Apert syndrome. To date mutations causing Crouzon syndrome have been reported only in exon IIIc of FGFR2. In view of the patterns of expression of Iglllb and IIIc (10,11), we had previously predicted, and demonstrated, that mutations in patients with Crouzon syndrome would occur in exon IIIc (5). In view of the failure to find mutations in 11 of 20 patients in the initial study, we extended the screen to include exon IIIu, which forms the other half of the IgHI loop and is common to both forms.  RESULTS Patients All patients showed typical features of Crouzon syndrome, of which the principal features were craniosynostosis, associated proptosis and mid-face hypoplasia. In particular there was no significant broadening of the thumbs or big toes. The diagnosis in all cases was clinical, with occasional radiological confirmation of normal limb anatomy. Several patients manifested minor digital abnormalities such as 2/3 syndactyly, commonly found in the normal population and consistent with a Crouzon phenotype (Fig. 2). Two patients have been described previously (C7 in ref. 23, 12529 in ref. 27). Mutations in exon IIIu Thirty-one patients with Crouzon syndrome were analysed for sequence changes in the third immunoglobulin domain of  Downloaded from http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/ at Reprints Desk on July 8, 2016  Craniosynostosis, which affects approximately 1 in 2000 children, is the result of the abnormal development and/or premature fusion of the cranial sutures. Studies of mutations in patients with craniosynostosis have shown that the family of fibroblast growth factor receptor genes are extremely important in the correct formation of the skull, and digits. Mutations in the third immunoglobulin domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), in part of the molecule corresponding to a tissue specific isoform (Me), can cause both Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes. Two specific mutations in the linking region between the second and third immunoglobulin domains of FGFR2 occur in Apert syndrome. We present here mutations associated with the Crouzon syndrome, also in the third immunoglobulin domain but in an upstream exon. This exon is expressed in both tissue isoforms. Five different mutations were detected in 11 unrelated individuals. A cysteine to phenylalanine change was found in six individuals. This cysteine forms half of the disulphide bridge maintaining the secondary structure of the immunoglobulin domain. The first deletion within an FGFR gene is reported. Together with mutations in exon Illc these account for 25 mutations out of 40 Crouzon patients studied in our combined series (5).  707*  Human Molecular Genetics, 1995, Vol. 4, No. 6 IG1  IG2  IG3  or  EXON 7  Figure 1. Schematic diagram of FGFR2 gene.  FGFR2 using single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP). SSCP analysis of exon IIIu revealed a number of different band shifts. DNA from patients with band shifts was sequenced and five mutations found. Several of the patients appeared to have an identical band shift. The first three of these patients to be analysed showed a TGC to TTC mutation, changing a cysteine at position 278 to phenylalanine. As this creates a Bbsl restriction site, all the remaining samples were tested for creation of this site. Six patients were found with the mutation (Fig. 3). A full list of the mutations found is presented in Table 1. The mutations were shown, by restriction enzyme analysis in both parents and the child, to arise de novo in three of the patients with a Cys278Phe change, in the patient with a Gln289Pro mutation and the Ser267Pro mutation. The mutations include a deletion of nine base pairs resulting in a three amino acid deletion. In this case, which is sporadic, the smaller fragment which is revealed most clearly after Mnll digestion, was shown to have arisen de novo. This is the first deletion described in the fibroblast growth factor receptor genes. One other recurrent mutation is found, Trp290Arg. None of the mutations described occur at the sequence CpG. Identification of further mutations in exon Hie Exon IIIc (8) was amplified from genomic DNA. Mutations in five patients, in addition to those previously published, were found (Table 2; Fig. 4a). All involved the loss or creation of a cysteine residue. One of them, Cys342Phe, represents a newly reported mutation and three others (one observed twice) have been previously reported. Of these, one also involves mutation of the critical cysteine (Cys342Tyr) and the other two disturb the S-S cross-linking in a different way, by creating a new cysteine residue (Ser347Cys and Ser354Cys). Cys342Phe destroys a BsaAl site. The Cys342Tyr mutation,  Figure 2. Members of a family with Crouzon syndrome before surgery.

In total, of the 40 Crouzon patients analysed, 14 have been found to have a mutation in this exon (this paper and ref. 5). DISCUSSION Crouzon syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder of craniofacial development, characterized clinically by an abnormal skull shape and prominent eyes. Changes in the hands and/or toes are not observed (20,21). The underlying physical cause is premature fusion of the cranial sutures or craniosynostosis. The consequence may be raised pressure on the developing brain requiring surgical intervention. With planned surgery a much improved facial appearance is achieved and normal intellectual development generally follows.

A gene for Crouzon syndrome was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 10 by genetic linkage (12) and although few large families have been studied no evidence for genetic heterogeneity has been found (13). In view of the chromosomal localisation of Crouzon syndrome, FGFR2 was tested as a candidate gene and mutations in this gene in Crouzon patients were demonstrated (5).

However, the two alternatively spliced forms showed distinct patterns of spatial expression (11). The form using the Illb exon, which is also called keratinocyte growth factor receptor because of its specific binding to FGF7 or keratinocyte growth factor, is expressed mainly in epithelia and was predicted to have a particular part in the formation of skin and its derivatives, while the form using exon IIIc is preferentially expressed during osteogenesis (11). Based on this prediction, changes were sought in exon IIIc in patients with Crouzon syndrome. The mutations found were believed to be causative because (i) many of them involved the cysteine which is essential for the three-dimensional structure of the immunoglobulin-like loop; (ii) de novo changes were found in sporadic patients; (iii) the changes segregated with the disorder in familial cases; and (iv) no such variants were found in normal individuals (5,6). In the initial study (5) mutations were found only in nine of 20 patients studied.  Patients with Pfeiffer syndrome have similar craniofacial changes to those with Crouzon syndrome but additionally have characteristic broad thumbs and toes (20-22). A gene for Pfeiffer syndrome was mapped to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 8, in some but not all families, in a linkage study (14) and, in view of the findings in Crouzon syndrome, the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene (FGFRl), which also maps to that region of chromosome 8, was regarded as a candidate. In contrast to the situation in Crouzon syndrome, there is a common mutation in the Pfeiffer families of a proline to arginine substitution located in exon IIIu, upstream of the cysteine residue involved in S-S binding, in the region linking immunoglobulin-like loops II and III (7). The FGFRl gene has a similar structural organization to the FGFR2 gene with alternative exons for the second half of immunoglobulin-like loop III (1) and so the Pfeiffer mutation would be expressed in all transcripts from the FGFRl gene locus. Apert syndrome is a further syndrome involving cranio-  Downloaded from http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/ at Reprints Desk on July 8, 2016  transmembrane  Human Molecular Genetics, 1995, Vol. 4, No. 6 1081  Although, including this work, there are now 14 described mutations in the third immunoglobulin-like loop which cause the Crouzon syndrome, the distribution is clearly not random as four different mutations account for 16 cases. None of the mutations corresponds to a CpG to TpG change, which has been well documented as having a high frequency and, therefore, the non-random distribution is likely to reflect the phenotypic consequence of the change rather than be an indirect consequence of mutation rate. The recurrent mutation at a specific nucleotide in FGFR3 in achondroplasia occurs  with an estimated frequency of between 1 per 15 000 and 1 per 40 000. This represents a remarkably high mutation rate. However, the nucleotide involved is indeed a G to A transition (corresponding to CpG to TpG in the antisense strand). There is some overall pattern in the range of mutations found in Crouzon syndrome patients (5,6, this work). The majority disrupt the intrachain disulphide bonding typical of immunoglobulin-like domains by mutations of either of the two cysteines, one from each exon, or by creation of a new cysteine. The disulphide bond stabilizes the whole structure by increasing hydrophobic interactions between amino acid residues inside the immunoglobulin fold. If the S-S bridges are removed or reformed a major conformational change of the secondary structure would be expected. The formal requirement for cysteine residues for the ligand binding activity of FGFR was shown by site-directed mutagenesis of each of the cysteines in FGFR1 (19). In addition the creation of free sulphydryl groups could allow aberrant disulphide bonding with other mutant FGFR2 molecules. This might lead to constitutive activation of the mutant homodimer, a mechanism that has previously been described for erythropoietin, epidermal growth factor and RET receptors (24-26). Two other recurrent mutations, Tyr340His and Trp29OArg, also occur at particularly highly conserved positions of both the FGFR family and the more extended family of immunoglobulin-like loops (18). This again suggests that they have a major part in preserving the structure. The difference in phenotypes between the Crouzon and Apert syndromes may be attributed to mutations which significantly disrupt the secondary structure and function of the FGFR2 molecule resulting in the Crouzon syndrome whereas specific mutations subtly affecting receptor function cause the Apert syndrome. There remain a number of patients with Crouzon syndrome, all of whom have been fully clinically assessed, in which we have found no mutation in exon IIIu or exon Me. No SSCP changes have been found in exon Mb (unpublished results) and there remains the possibility that these cases may be caused by mutations elsewhere in FGFR2, in FGFR1 or even in one of the ligands for FGFR2, such as FGF1, 2 or 4.  MATERIALS AND METHODS Exon IIIu analysis Sequences from exon IIIu were either obtained from cDNA using published methods (8) or from genomic DNA. Primers for PCR amplification of the exon from genomic DNA were designed, using PRIMER program (Version 5.0) from the extreme 5' end of the sequence and from the downstream intron. Forward: 5'-GAGCGATCGCCTCACC-3' Reverse: 5'-TGTGGGTACCTTTAGATTCAGAAAG-3'. The reverse primer was biotinylated at the 5' end and the sequencing carried out using magnetic streptavidin coated beads (Dynal UK). SSCP analysis was carried out as previously described (5,8). Restriction enzyme digestion PCR products from exon IIIu were digested with Bbs\ (New England Biolabs), Bsfl. (New England Biolabs), Bsall (New England Biolabs) or Mnh (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the resulting product separated on a 2% agarose or 4.5% Metaphor (Flowgen) gel. PCR products from exon IIIc were digested with BsaAl (New England Biolabs) and separated on a 2% agarose gel. Exon IIIc analysis SSCP and DNA sequencing was carried out as previously described (5).

Owing to the severity of the condition, large families suitable for linkage studies do not exist, but it was possible to analyse a number of small families in an exclusion analysis of the loci for the fibroblast growth factor receptor genes 1, 2 and 3 (8) which predicted that FGFR2 was again the most likely candidate. All 40 cases of Apert syndrome analysed showed missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acids, either serine 252 to tryptophan or proline 253 to arginine (8). This second mutation is exactly equivalent, in position and sequence, to the Pfeiffer causing mutation on chromosome 8 and would, therefore, also be expressed in both isoforms of the gene. In view of these results, exon IIIu of FGFR2, which encodes the first half of the Iglll domain, was screened, initially by SSCP, for mutations causing Crouzon syndrome. We report here five such mutations in 11 unrelated individuals. The evidence that these changes are disease causing follows that given above for the mutations in exon Me. They are nonconservative and in five cases involve the cysteine involved in S-S binding, several were observed de novo and no such changes have been observed in at least 200 individuals without craniosynostosis. Correlation of the phenotype and genotype poses a fascinating problem in the case of FGFRs. In addition to the results just discussed it has been shown that mutations in FGFR2, exon Me, can also cause Pfeiffer syndrome (9), presumably explaining at least some and maybe all of the genetic heterogeneity observed by Robin et al. (14). Surprisingly, two of the mutations described, both involving Cys342, are identical to mutations described in the Crouzon syndrome and three additional mutations have been found including a splice site mutation (9,15). A further missense mutation in exon Me, Alanine 344 to Glycine, causes Jackson-Weiss syndrome in a single family. The findings to date are summarized in Fig. 5. It was impossible to distinguish clinically between the cases of Crouzon syndrome arising from exon Me mutations and those arising from exon IIIu mutations. Therefore, apparently the phenotype arises from disruption of the Me exon form of FGFR2 with little additional contribution from KGFR (Mb). Conversely, it seems that KGFR mutant molecules may not result in an abnormal phenotype in the heterozygous state. It also remains unknown why mutations in a position in the molecule which will affect both forms should have such a limited effect on the phenotype. Fibroblast growth factor receptors interact with the growth factors via a heparin complex (16,17) and their action in vivo will be modulated by cellular proteoglycans. The Igll-IgM regions of the molecules are involved in this interaction (17). It is possible that the clinical effects reflect to some extent the exact proteoglycan content at the site of the sutures or in the digits.  1082  Human Molecular Genetics, 1995, Vol. 4, No. 6  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the Medical Research Council (UP, WR, RMW, SM) and the Wellcome Trust (MO, AOMW, SFS).

Studies of mutations in patients with craniosynostosis have shown that the family of fibroblast growth factor receptor genes are extremely important in the correct formation of the skull, and digits. Mutations in the third immunoglobulin domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), in part of the molecule corresponding to a tissue specific isoform (IIIc), can cause both Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes. Two specific mutations in the linking region between the second and third immunoglobulin domains of FGFR2 occur in Apert syndrome. We present here mutations associated with the Crouzon syndrome, also in the third immunoglobulin domain but in an upstream exon. This exon is expressed in both tissue isoforms. Five different mutations were detected in 11 unrelated individuals. A cysteine to phenylalanine change was found in six individuals. This cysteine forms half of the disulphide bridge maintaining the secondary structure of the immunoglobulin domain. The first deletion within an FGFR gene is reported. Together with mutations in exon IIIc these account for 25 mutations out of 40 Crouzon patients studied in our combined series (5)."

This is a Duchenne-like disease affecting both males and females first described in Tunisian families. Adhalin deficiency has been found in SCARMD patients from North Africa Europe, Brazil, Japan and North America (SLR & KPC, unpublished data). The disease was initially linked to an unidentified gene on chromosome 13 in families from North Africa, and to the adhalin gene itself on chromosome 17q in one French family in which missense mutations were identified. Thus there are two kinds of myopathies with adhalin deficiency: one with a primary defect of adhalin (primary adhalinopathies), and one in which absence of adhalin is secondary to a separate gene defect on chromosome 13. We have examined the importance of primary adhalinopathies among myopathies with adhalin deficiency, and describe several additional mutations (null and missense) in the adhalin gene in 10 new families from Europe and North Africa. Disease severity varies in age of onset and rate of progression, and patients with null mutations are the most severely affected.Primary adhalinopathy: a common cause of autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy of variable severity."
"1","We report five novel mutations in the human Ca(2+)-sensing-receptor gene that cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) or neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism. Each gene defect is a missense mutation (228Arg-->Gln, 139Thr-->Met, 144Gly-->Glu, 63Arg-->Met, and 67Arg-->Cys) that encodes a nonconservative amino acid alteration. These mutations are each predicted to be in the Ca(2+)-sensing receptor's large extracellular domain. In three families with FHH linked to the Ca(2+)-sensing-receptor gene on chromosome 3 and in unrelated individuals probands with FHH, mutations were not detected in protein-coding sequences. On the basis of these data and previous analyses, we suggest that there are a wide range of mutations that cause FHH. Mutations that perturb the structure and function of the extracellular or transmembrane domains of the receptor and those that affect noncoding sequences of the Ca(2+)-sensing-receptor gene can cause FHH.Mutations in the human Ca(2+)-sensing-receptor gene that cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.Am.

Each gene defect is a missense mutation  (228Arg-Gln, 139Thr-+Met, 144GlyGlu 63Arg--Met, and 67Arg-*Cys) that encodes a nonconservative amino acid alteration. These mutations are each predicted to be in the Ca2+-sensing receptor's large extracellular domain. In three families with FHH linked to the Ca2+sensing-receptor gene on chromosome 3 and in unrelated individuals probands with FHH, mutations were not detected in protein-coding sequences. On the basis of these data and previous analyses, we suggest that there are a wide range of mutations that cause FHH. Mutations that perturb the structure and function of the extracellular or transmembrane domains of the receptor and those that affect noncoding sequences of the Ca2+sensing-receptor gene can cause FHH. Introduction  The human Ca2+-sensing receptor plays a critical role in determining the level of extracellular Ca2+ (Brown et al. 1993; Pollak et al. 1993). This receptor is expressed in the parathyroid gland and kidney, where interaction with Ca2+ inhibits release of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and modulates renal reabsorption of Ca2+, respectively, by unknown mechanisms. The proposed topology of the bovine Ca2+-sensing receptor (Brown et al. 1993) is that of a large N-terminal extracellular domain and seven membrane-spanning regions, similar to Received October 12, 1994; accepted for publication February 21, 1995.

The Ca2"-sensing receptor's extracellular domain contains regions with a high density of acidic amino acids that are comparable to ion-binding sites in low-affinity Ca2"-binding proteins. The seven membrane-spanning regions and intracellular loops are believed to be important for signal transduction, presumably by coupling to G proteins. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH; also known as familial benign hypercalcemia) and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) can be caused by mutations in the Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene (Pollak et al. 1993). FHH is generally an asymptomatic disorder inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with -100% penetrance in childhood. Affected individuals exhibit mild or modest hypercalcemia, relative hypocalciuria, and inappropriately normal PTH levels (reviewed in Marx et al. 1981; Attie et al. 1983; Law and Heath 1985). In contrast, NSHPT is a rare life-threatening disorder characterized by very high serum Ca2" concentrations (sometimes >20 mg/dl), skeletal demineralization, and parathyroid hyperplasia. In some instances NSHPT has been demonstrated to be the homozygous form of FHH (Steinmann et al. 1984; Marx et al. 1992) and is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait (Pollak et al. 1994b). Elsewhere, we have reported three mutations that cause FHH and NSHPT (Pollak et al. 1993). In two families the mutation is located in the extracellular domain; in another family the defect is in the third intracellular loop of the receptor. To further elucidate the functional consequences of defects in the Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene encoded on chromosome 3, we studied additional families with these clinical conditions. We report five novel missense mutations in the extracellular domain of the Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene in probands from five FHH families. A mutation was not identified in three probands from families with FHH linked to chromosome 3. Collectively, these data suggest that mutations in the large extracellular domain are a common 1075  Am. J. Hum. Genet. 56:1075-1079, 1995  1076  cause of FHH. We also speculate that gene defects that perturb expression of the Ca2+-sensing receptor can also produce this disorder. Material and Methods Collection of Samples  Informed consent was obtained from all participants or their guardians, in accordance with standards established by local institutional review boards for the protection of human subjects from research risks. DNA from members of 22 unrelated families or individuals with definite or possible FHH or NSHPT was studied. The diagnosis of FHH was based on the finding of asymptomatic hypercalcemia accompanied by normal levels of PTH. The diagnosis of NSHPT was made on the basis of marked hypercalcemia presenting shortly after birth and marked elevation of serum PTH levels. Total serum and urinary calcium concentrations were measured by colorimetric assays. Detailed clinical and laboratory descriptions of several of these families have been reported elsewhere. Amplification of Genomic DNA and RNase Protection Assays  RNase protection assays to detect mutations in the Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene, described elsewhere (Pollak et al. 1993; Watkins et al. 1994), involved the following steps: Genomic DNA was isolated from either peripheral lymphocytes or Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cell lines (Holcombe et al. 1987; Jacobs and Celeste 1989). Ten segments (100-900 bp each) of the Ca2+-sensingreceptor gene encompassing the entire coding region were amplified by PCR (Pollak et al. 1993). PCR-amplified proband DNA was hybridized to 32P-labeled RNA probes. The resulting RNA-DNA hybrid was digested with RNase A (Sigma). The digestion was stopped by the addition of SDS and proteinase K and analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Riboprobes 1-5 were derived from the restriction fragments of genomic clones and contained splice donor/acceptor sequences; riboprobes 6-8 were derived from subclones of a kidney cDNA. To increase the probability of identifying all mutations, both sense and antisense riboprobes were used. Amplified DNA samples yielding abnormal RNase cleavage patterns were reanalyzed with new DNA isolates to exclude artifacts arising from the PCR.  Sequencing of PCR Products To demonstrate the presence of these mutations in the Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene in genomic DNA samples, the relevant PCR product was either sequenced directly (using the Stratagene Cyclist kit) or subcloned into the BamHIIEcoRI site of the Bluescript II SK vector (Stratagene) and sequenced (Sequenase kit, USB). To exclude possible sequence differences that arose  during PCR amplification or cloning, the samples were reamplified and assayed for the mutation by one of two techniques. The mutations detected in families I (63Arg-+Met) and Q (67Arg-*Cys) are predicted to change a restriction site and were confirmed by digests with relevant restriction enzymes. Mutations found in families A (228Arg-+Gln), C (139Thr-+Met), and D (144Gly" Glu) were confirmed by oligo-specific hybridization (Jacobs and Celeste 1989). LOD Score Calculations LOD scores were calculated using the computer program MLINK (Ott 1991) assuming recombination distance 0, 100% penetrance, and FHH gene frequency or mutant allele frequency of .01. Results Clinical Data  Affected individuals from 20 families with FHH and! or NSHPT were studied. Both affected and unaffected individuals were available for study from eight of these families. Their pedigrees and clinical evaluations have been reported elsewhere (families A, B, C, and D in Chou et al. 1992; family I in Marx et al. 1985; family P in Menko et al 1983; and families Q and S in Pollak et al. 1994b). Only one proband was available for study in the remaining 12 FHH families. The clinical features of FHH in these probands were not significantly different from those described previously (Marx et al. 1981; Law and Heath 1985). RNase Protection Analysis of the Ca2&-Sensing-Receptor Gene in FHHINSHPT Probands RNase protection assays were used to screen the six exons of the Ca2+-sensing receptor, as described elsewhere (Pollak et al. 1993). Riboprobes 1-5 were derived from subcloned restriction fragments of genomic clones; riboprobes 6-10 were derived from subclones of a kidney cDNA clone (fig. 1). To increase the probability of identifying all point mutations or small alterations, both sense and antisense riboprobes were used. Genomic DNA from two affected members, each, of eight kindreds (families A, B, C, D, I, Q, and S) and 12 unrelated FHH probands was amplified using PCR, followed by RNase protection assay (see Material and Methods). Sequence variations between the riboprobes (derived from the wild-type Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene) and DNA samples from these individuals were recognized by abnormal-sized cleavage products (fig. 1). DNAs bearing single point mutations generally produce two abnormal RNA fragments resulting from cleavage of the riboprobe.

Point Mutations in the Ca2'-Sensing Receptor  DNAs yielding aberrant RNase protection patterns were characterized by nucleotide sequence analysis of subcloned PCR products (see Material and Methods). The nucleotide sequences of these variants were independently confirmed either by hybridization to oligonucleotides specific for the nucleotide change or by digestion with a restriction enzyme whose recognition site was altered by the sequence change (data not shown). Five novel sequence changes were identified (table 1). Each of the observed nucleotide changes are predicted to cause amino acid substitutions in the Ca2"-sensing receptor. To demonstrate that these sequence variants are not common polymorphisms and are associated with disease, two experiments were performed. First, we examined DNAs from 50 normal individuals for the presence of these mutations. None of the 100 normal chromosomes represented in these individuals had any of the missense mutations (data not shown). Second, DNAs from affected and unaffected family members were tested for the presence of the mutation initially identified in probands. In each family, the mutation was present in all DNA samples derived from affected individuals Table I Mutations in the Ca2'-Sensing-Receptor Gene  Amino Acid  Family  Exon  Codon Change  Change  A .....

The likelihoods that the disease and the mutation are co-inherited in each of the five families are indicated in table 1. RNase protection assays of probands from three families (B, P, and S) and 12 unrelated probands failed to identify a mutation. To determine whether genetic heterogeneity could account for this finding, linkage studies were performed in the three families. FHH/NSHPT was linked to the Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene on chromosome 3 in each of these kindreds. By using the polymorphic locus D3S1303 (Weissenbach et al. 1992), a maximum two-point lod score of 4.52 was achieved in FHH family B, 4.5 was achieved in FHH family P, and 1.89 was achieved in NSHPT family S. To determine whether mutations in the splice donor or acceptor sequences might account for the disorders in these families, small regions of flanking intron sequences were analyzed (data not shown); no abnormalities were identified. Discussion  We describe five sequence variations, found in the Ca2+-sensing receptor, that cause FHH and NSHPT. All five sequence variations share three features. First, they each alter a single nucleotide that changes the encoded amino acid (228Arg--Gln, 139Thr-+Met, 144GlyGlu, 63Arg-*Met, and 67Arg-+Cys). Second, they are not found in >100 normal chromosomes. Third, they are co-inherited with disease in the affected individuals' families. We conclude that all five sequence variations cause FHH. The Ca2+-sensing receptor is translated from a 5.4-kb mRNA that is encoded in >20 kb of genomic DNA (Brown et al. 1993). On the basis of homology with previously described receptors, the Ca2+-sensing receptor appears to be a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily (fig. 2). The consequences of mutations in this receptor may be indirect and alter polypeptide folding, receptor processing, or stability. However, the distribution of FHH/NSHPT mutations within this gene suggests that specific structure-function relation-  1078  Am. J. Hum.

To date, 13 mutations have been reported in exons 2, 3, and 6 (Pollak et al. 1993, 1994b; Pearce et al. 1994; and data in the present paper). Mutations in exons 2 and 3, which are postulated to encode the large extracellular domain of this protein, produce two different phenotypes. While most of the mutations identified in this region cause FHH and NSHPT, one mutation, 128Glu-Ala, results in autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (Pollak et al. 1994a). The divergent phenotypes associated with these mutations suggest that the extracellular domain is critical for determining the receptor's affinity or interaction with Ca2+; mutations within this region appear to reset (up or down) ion binding and receptor activation. Four mutations have also been identified within exon 6 (Pollak et al. 1993; Pearce et al. 1994), which encodes the membrane-spanning segments, intracellular loops, and carboxy-terminal tail of the receptor. It seems likely that FHH produced by these mutations results from perturbation of signal transduction following ligand binding. It is noteworthy that mutations were not identified in coding sequences of the Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene, in splice donor or acceptor sequences (data not shown) in probands from three families with FHH that is linked to chromosome 3q, or from 12 individual FHH probands.  While genetic heterogeneity may explain the absence of mutation detection in the latter group, several studies (Heath et al. 1993; Pollak et al. 1994b) have demonstrated that most FHH is due to a gene defect at the 3q locus. RNase protection assays were employed to detect mutations. Because the sensitivity of mutation detection by assays that employ both sense and antisense riboprobes is quite high (Kaufman et al. 1990), it is unlikely that these analyses failed to identify coding sequence mutations. Our previous studies (MacRae et al. 1994) suggested that >95% of all missense mutations are detected using these methods. The riboprobes used in these studies (detailed in Pollak et al. 1993) contained all intron and exon boundaries except those flanking exons 5 and 6. Therefore, most mutations that interrupted splice signals should have been identified. We presume that the gene defects in some FHH families are located in the noncoding sequences but not in the conserved splice signals immediately 5' and 3' of each exon. These mutations may cause subtle alterations in the regulated expression of the Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene or may have more substantial effects on gene transcription, as has been recently described in the factor VIII gene (Naylor et al. 1993). Regardless, it appears that mutations that alter receptor number and/or density can also cause the FHH phenotype. The effect of different missense mutations on the hypercalcemic phenotype is difficult to ascertain from these studies. As multiple different clinical laboratories were used to measure serum Ca2" levels, we are unable to draw conclusions regarding the effect of a specific mutation on serum Ca2" concentration. However, affected individuals in family I (63Arg--Met) had quite mild hypercalcemia. In contrast, one family I member who was homozygous for this mutation had NSHPT with marked hypercalcemia (Marx et al. 1985). We conclude that the potential of a mutation to cause life-threatening disease in the homozygous state cannot be predicted from the heterozygous phenotype. We suggest that many mutations within the Ca2+sensing receptor cause FHH, NSHPT, or familial hypocalcemia. Of the 13 mutations identified to date, each are unique, implying little if any founder effect in these disorders. In view of the mild symptoms associated with FHH and the absence of any effect on the reproductive fitness in affected individuals, it also seems possible that individuals with mild asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism and/or borderline hypercalcemia may actually have mutations (or polymorphisms) in their Ca2+-sensing-receptor genes.

"0","Thermodynamic parameters for the intramolecular disordered-to-beta transition of poly(L-tyrosine) in aqueous solution.We have examined the disordered-to-beat transition of two samples of high molecular wieght poly(L-tyrosine), a polypeptide with an ionizing side chain, by potentiometric titration of solutions of this polymer in aqueous buffer. The degree of ionization was determined spectrophotometrically from the absorption of the tyrosinate anion at 293.5 nm. By using polymer solutions of high dilution the region of the conformational transition was separated from that of aggregation. As a consequence it was possible to obtain titration data for the intramolecular transition which we believe are free of interference from aggregation. For this transition we found that deltaHO=-1330 cal/mol of residue. The two samples gave values of -3.42+/-0.14 and -3.85+/-0.10 u for the change in entropy. Possible artifactual origins for this distinction have been examined and may be dicounted. Rather, it probably reflects a difference in the beta structures formed which depends on molecular weight."

PEARSE* From the Department o{Urology, University o{Oregon Health Sciences Center, Portland, Oregon  ABSTRACT  The pedicled omentum can be used effectively to cover the ureterointestinal anastomosis and to fill the irradiated, denuded pelvis after a radical cancer operation. The use of the pedicled omentum in a reconstructive operation on the urinary tract has been described by Kiricuta and Goldstein, 1 and popularized by Turner-Warwick. 2• 3 Its primary use to support the ureterointestinal anastomosis and to fill the irradiated, denuded and empty pelvis after a radical cancer operation is described. The principles of omental mobilization are well outlined by Turner-Warwick and include 1) use of absorbable suture material and individual vessel ligation (this may not be necessary on the gastric side but is indicated on the pedicle  omental pedicle in a retroperitoneal position, 5) adequate abdominal exposure and 6) anticipation that the procedure may be used. 2 Part A of the figure shows an omental pedicle graft based on the right gastroepiploic artery. The colon is then mobilized and retracted medially. The omentum covers and supports the ureteroileal anastomosis (part B of figure). The right colon is returned to its normal position. The omentum is now in a retroperitoneal position and the dependent portian is allowed to fill the pelvis (parte of figure).
