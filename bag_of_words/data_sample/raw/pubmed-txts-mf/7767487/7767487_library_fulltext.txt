This report describes clinical, neuropathological and
molecular genetic findings in a Swiss family with
four brain tumours i n only t w o generations. The
neoplasms observed covered a w i d e range o f
biologic behaviour, from a slowly growing lesion
already apparent at birth, t o anaplastic astrocytoma
in a young adult and glioblastomas at the age of
less then 10 years. The only non-neural neoplasms
in t h i s f a m i l y were a case o f leukemia and an
adrenocortical carcinoma. A germline deletion of
codon 236 of the p 5 3 tumour suppressor gene was
identified as an underlying cause and detected in all
affected family members. This mutation has not
previously been reported as germline transmission
or in sporadic tumours. The unusual accumulation
of CNS tumours may be due t o a certain organspecific effect of this particular p 5 3 mutation or it
may reflect the specific genetic back-ground of this
family.

Introduction

Alterations of the p 5 3 tumour suppressor gene
detected in sporadic tumours represent the most
common genetic alteration in human neoplasms and
occur as somatic point mutations in the four highly
conserved regions of the gene (1-4). Evidence for the
role of inherited p53 mutations in familial cancer
predisposition came from their detection in the
germline of patients with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome

(LFS) (5, 6). This inherited neoplastic disease was
initially described as a familial clustering of softtissue or bone sarcomas, breast cancer and an excess
of other neoplasms, including leukemia, brain
tumours and adrenocortical carcinomas in children
and young adults (7). Many, but not all families
affected by this autosomal dominant disease carry
p53 mutations. This report describes a familial brain
tumour syndrome with four central nervous system
(CNS) neoplasms in two generations of a Swiss
family. The absence of sarcomas and breast tumours
puts this pedigree outside the classical LFS. Genetic
analyses revealed a p53 germline deletion of codon
236 in all affected family members.
Family and Case Histories

Generation I. The mother 1 grandmother of the
described patients is 68 years old and is well (I B in
Fig. 1). Her husband (I A) died of leukemia at the age
of 47. He had twelve brothers and sisters. Five have
died between the ages of one and 24 years, but none
from cancer. Three sisters and five brothers are still
alive and well.
Generation II. The couple described as I A and I B had
five children: two of t h e m have died of brain
tumours (I1 C and I1 D), and three are well (I1 A, I1 E
and I1 F).
The youngest daughter (I1 C) was well until the age
of 9 1/2, w h e n she began complaining about
cephalea and nausea. Clinical examination revealed a
temporobasal tumour in the right hemisphere, and a
temporal lobectomy was performed. Fractionated
radiation (50 Gy) and cytostatic therapy were carried
o u t b u t three m o n t h s after surgery, a t u m o u r
recurrence became apparent and the patient died at
the age of 10 years.
Except for tonsillectomy, the elder sister (I1 D) was
well until the age of 22, when she experienced visual
disturbances and weakness of the left arm, followed
by episodes of unsteady gait, blurred speech and lack
of concentration. Two m o n t h s later, she had a
generalized epileptic seizure and was admitted to the
hospital where she presented with a Foster-Kennedy
syndrome on the right side, central facial paresis on
the left side, and left-sided hemiparesis. CT showed a

carriers of the germline mutation have been identified with the exception of the putative founder of the disorder, patient I A.

very large cystic mass in the frontoparietal right
hemisphere. The tumor was surgically removed and
the patient underwent fractionated radiation therapy
(total dose, 50 gy) postoperatively. Four years later,
an androgen producing adrenocortical carcinoma
was diagnosed and surgically removed. One year
later, the patient had a grand-ma1 seizure and a CT
scan revealed a large butterfly-shaped glioma
recurrence. The patient died 2 1/2 months later at
the age of 27 years.
Generation III. One female member of generation (I1
A) had three sons (111 A, B, C). At the age of 4 1/2
years, patient 111 A was admitted to the hospital in a
stuporous state, with deviation conjugee to the left,
and clonic seizures of the left leg. CT and MRI scans
showed an ill-defined occipital lesion in the right
hemisphere that was surgically removtd (Fig. 2).
Three months later the patient again developed
raised intracranial pressure. MRI scans suggested
tumour recurrence. The tumour was surgically
removed and the patient died three months later.
Patient 111 B developed signs of hydrocephalus
shortly after birth. CT scans showed an irregularly

shaped central mass and a marked hydrocephalus. A
ventriculo-atrial shunt was inserted at the age of 10
months. Repeated CT controls suggested the
presence of a slowly growing tumour with signs of
calcification, most likely a pilocytic astrocytoma
(WHO Grade I) or oligodendroglioma (WHO Grade
11). The last MRI was performed at the age of 9 years
in 1994 and there was no unambiguous evidence of
tumour growth (Fig. 2). The youngest of the three
brothers (111 C) and two cousins (111 D and I11 E) are
healthy.
Materials and Methods

lmmunohistochemistry. The sections for the
immunohistochemical stainings for GFAP and P53
protein were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated
in graded ethanol. The endogeneous peroxidase was
blocked by 3% H,02 in absolute methanol for 20
minutes. The sections were preincubated with
normal swine serum (diluted 15 in PBS, Dako) or
normal rabbit serum (diluted 1:lO in PBS, Dako) for
GFAP and P53, respectively, followed by incubation
with the primary antibody for 60 minutes (GFAP

polyclonal antibody, diluted 1:300 in PBS, Dako; P53
monoclonal antibody, diluted 1:300 i n PBS,
Cambridge Research Biochemicals). After rinsing in
PBS, sections were incubated with swine anti-rabbit,
biotinylated (GFAP) or rabbit anti-mouse,
biotinylated (P53) for 30 min (Dako). This was
followed by a 30 minute incubation with the avidinbiotin complex (Dako) and finally the reaction was
revealed with diaminobenzidine. Immunohistochemical stains for MIB-1 were performed according
t o t h e microwave oven h e a t i n g m e t h o d . Deparaffinized slides were placed in 10 mM citrate
buffer (pH 6.0) and incubated in a 750 W microwave
oven for 3 cycles of 5 minutes each. The slides were
then allowed to cool for 20 min, rinsed in distilled
water twice, and equilibrated in PBS for 5 min.
Sections were t h e n stained with monoclonal
antibody MIB-1 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany;
dilution: 1:lO).
In all MIB-1 and P53 immunoreactive specimens, the
staining was quantified at 400 x magnification on
3-5 visual fields each, using a square graticule. More
than one thousand nuclei were counted in each
specimen.

Extraction of DNA. DNA was extracted from white
blood cells, fresh frozen biopsy specimens, or
archival paraffin embedded tissue. Blood could be
obtained from I B, I1 A, I1 B, I1 E, I1 F, 111 A, I11 B, and
I11 C. White blood cells were digested with proteinase
K in equal volumes of phosphate buffered saline

(PBS) and 2x lysis buffer (Applied Biosystems) for
three hours at 50°C. DNA was precipitated in ethanol
after phenol-chloroform extraction, and diluted with
H 2 0 to a final concentration of 100 ng/pl. From
patient 111 A, tumour biopsies were obtained directly
from surgery, shock frozen and stored at -80°C until
further use. From patients I1 C and I1 D, only archival
paraffin embedded tissue was available. About four 8
p m t h i n a n d lcm2 large sections were used for
extraction. Under microscopic control, the neoplastic
parts of the sections were scraped off with a razor
blade and directly shifted into 1.5 ml reaction tubes.
The same was done with surrounding normal tissue,
if present. The material was incubated with 100 pl
DNA extraction buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 1 mM
EDTA pH 8.0 and 0.5% Tween 20), heated to 95°C for
30 min, and spun down in a benchtop centrifuge for
30 min at 13000 g, while cooling down to 4°C. A
solid paraffin cap formed during the procedure
which could easily be removed. The solution was
digested with proteinase K at 37°C overnight. The
product was then heated at 95°C for ten minutes to
inactivate the proteinase K.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR was carried
out with 70 to 150 ng of genomic DNA, 2.0 pmol of
each primer, 50 pM deoxynucleotide triphosphates,
0.8 pCi of [a-32P] dCTP (Amersham, specific activity
3000 Ci/rnmol), 0.8 p1 PCR-buffer I1 (Perkin Elmer
Cetus), 0.5 units Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer
Cetus) and 0.8 to 1.5 mM MgC12 in a final volume of

8 pl. After addition of 10 pl mineral oil (Sigma), the
samples were subjected to 35 cycles of denaturation
(95°C for 6 0 s), annealing (60°C for 60 s) a n d
extension (72°C for 70 s) using an automated DNA
Thermal Cycler (Perkin Elmer Cetus). The primers for
exons 5 to 8 were designed from intron sequences (8)
as described earlier (9). The following primers were
used for exon 7: 5' ACTGGCCTCATCTTGGGCCTGT 3',
and 5' CGGTGAACGGTGGGACGTGT 3'.

Single-strand conformation analysis (PCR-SSCA).
Screening of the samples for detection of mutations in
the p53 gene was performed basically according to the
method described by Orita et al. (10). Two pl of the
PCR product were mixed with 2 p1 0.1 M NaOH and 9
p1 of sequencing stop solution (USB). Samples were
heated at 95°C for 10 min and immediately loaded
o n t o a 6Yo polyacrylamide nondenaturating gel
containing 10% glycerol. Gels were ruri at 7 W for
13-15 hours at room temperature. For autoradiography, dried gels were exposed for 12-36 hours
with an intensifying screen at -80°C and the banding
patterns were analyzed for abnormal shifts. Negative
controls, with confirmed normal base sequence in the
respective exon, were run on each gel. All samples
were subjected to at least two PCR-SSCAs.

Direct sequencing of PCR products. The amplified
product of a 40 pl PCR (not 3zP-labeled) was loaded
on to a 6% polyacrylamide gel, run at 160 Volts for
20 m i n , stained w i t h e t h i d i u m bromide a n d
visualized under UV light. The specific bands were
cut out, eluted in 0.5 M ammonium acetate and 1
mM EDTA at 37°C overnight, and precipitated with
ethanol. DNA was pelleted, dried, and dissolved in
13 p1 H 2 0 . Sanger dideoxynucleotide sequencing
was performed using the sequencing kit from USB.
Four p1 dissolved DNA and 7.5 pmol primer were
mixed with 2 p1 5x reaction buffer and 1 p1 DMSO
in a final volume of 10 pl, heated at 95°C for 5 min,
and shock frozen in liquid nitrogen. An aliquot

reaction product was mixed with 4 pl stop solution,
heated at 90°C for 2 min and immediately loaded
onto a 6% polyacrylamide 7 M urea sequencing gel
(Gibco) preheated to 50°C. The gel was run at 1700

Sefective oligonucleotide hybridization. cDNA was
prepared from the tumour of patient 111 A using the
RNA isolation method described by Chomczynski
and Sacchi (11) and performing reverse transcription
with oligo-dT or random primers using a RNA-PCR
KIT (Perkin Elmer). A 505 base pair (bp) fragment,
containing bp 740 to 1246 of the p53 cDNA was
amplified by PCR using nested primers. Ten pl of the
PCR-reaction were run on a 1% agarose gel, which
was blotted o n t o a N-bond plus membrane
(Amersham) under alkaline conditions. Synthetic
19-mer oligonucleotides, centered on codon 236 or
on the deletion of codon 236 (bp 841-843) were used
as probes for the normal sequence or the deletion
mutant, respectively. The oligonucleotides were
endlabeled with [y-32P]ATP (Amersham) and T4
polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) and
purified on Nick Columns (Pharmacia) prior to use.
The filters were hybridized and washed mainly
according to the dot-blot method of Verlaan-de Vries
et al. (12). For higher stringency the hybridization
solution contained 30% formamide and 0.5% SDS.
The blots were washed two degrees below Tm of the
respective oligonucleotide. No hybridization of the
oligonucleotide, lacking codon 236 to a PCR product
from normal p53 cDNA was observed.
Results

Surgical pathology and immunos tainings.
Brain tumour, p a t i e n t I1 C : Histopathological
examination revealed a highly anaplastic, loosely
textured neoplasm with marked mitotic activity and
focal necrosis. Tumour cells were round or polygonal

shaped and showed a tendency to cluster around
vessels. Immunohistochemically, there was a marked
expression of GFAP and a nuclear accumulation of
the P53 protein (Fig. 3C) in 44% of tumour cells. The
growth fraction (percent of MIB-1 stained nuclei)
amounted to 9.8%. According to the criteria of the
World Health Organization (13) the neoplasm was
diagnosed as glioblastoma multiforme (WHO Grade
IV) .
Brain tumour, patient I1 D: In most areas, the tumour
displayed t h e typical features of a fibrillary
astrocytoma with low cellularity and numerous
microcysts. However, there were foci with a n
admixture of neoplastic gemistocytic astrocytes,
increased cellularity, occasional giant cells and
occasional small foci of necrosis. GFAP expression
was moderate. A significant fraction of tumour cell
nuclei (13%) showed an immunohistochemically
detectable accumulation of the P53 protein (Fig.
3A). Mitoses were rare but immunostaining for
MIB-l/Ki-67 showed a growth fraction of 14.5%.
On the basis of these criteria, the tumour was
classified as anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO Grade
111).

Adrenocortical carcinoma, patient II D: The biopsy
exhibited a highly polymorphic tumour of
characteristic endocrine structure (Fig. 3B). It
consisted of small cells with round nuclei and in
addition showed a marked pleomorphism
including bizarre cells and multinucleated tumour
giant cells. There were mitotic figures including
abnormal forms. Furthermore, there appeared to be
a focal capsular infiltration as well as infiltration of

cells. Lanes 1-6 represent samples from family members as
shown in Fig. 1. Lane 7 exhibits the wild-type (wt) sequence of
a normal control proband. Mobility shifts are present in
samples from patients II A, Ill A, and Ill B, indicative of a
mutation in p53 exon 7.

several veins inside t h e tumour. No immunohistochemically detectable P53 expression was
observed.
Bruin turnour, patient 111 A: Histopathologically, the
biopsy showed the features of a highly anaplastic
tumour of astrocytic origin (Fig. 3D). Tumour cells
varied considerably in shape and size and there was a
marked mitotic activity, with a growth fraction of
11.7%. A small number of tumour cell nuclei (6%)
showed an immunohistochemically detectable
accumulation of the P53 protein. The second biopsy
revealed similar histopathological features (growth
fraction, 17.5%; P53 labeling index, 13%). The
diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme was made,
based on the high degree of anaplasia and presence
of vascular proliferations and focal necrosis.

this tumour harbored an additional p 5 3 mutation
(C->T in codon 273, exon 8) as previously
documented (14). The germline deletion of codon
236 was not present in white blood cell DNA from
four healthy pedigree members (I B, II E, I1 F, 111 C )
and from the husband (I1 B) of II A. The deletion
mutation was also confirmed in the cDNA isolated
from the tumour of patient Ill A using selective
oligonucleotide hybridization. Expression of the
deletion mutant protein was present in all the brain
tumours as indicated by immunohistochemical
staining and the apparent loss of the wild-type p53
allele. In addition, expression of the mutant mRNA
was determined in the tumour from patient 111 A. For
a synopsis of the genetic analyses see Figs. 4 to 6 and
Table 1.

p53 Mutations. SSCA of white blood cell DNA was
carried out on a total of 8 family members. Of these,
three individuals (I1 A, Ill A, I11 B) showed an altered
migration pattern, indicative for the presence of a
mutation in p53 exon 7 (Fig. 4). In these samples,
sequencing analysis identified a deletion. of codon
236 in exon 7 of the p 5 3 tumour suppressor gene
(Fig. 5, 6). The sequence ladder of DNA from white
blood cells suggested the presence of both, the
deletion mutant and the wild-type allele, whereas
glioma-derived DNA sequences did not show wildtype bands, indicating loss of heterozygosity in these
tumours (Fig. 5, 6). In contrast, the sequencing
pattern adjacent to codon 236 of the adrenocortical
carcinoma of patient II D suggested the presence of
both, the mutant and the wild-type allele. However,

Discussion

The association of a p 5 3 germline mutation with a
familial clustering of brain tumours as reported here
is exceptional: (i) four members in only two
generations developed a brain tumour, (ii) only two
non-neural neoplasms were observed (leukemia,
adrenocortical carcinoma), and (iii) the underlying
mutation, i.e. deletion of codon 236 has n o t
previously been reported. The types of CNS tumours
observed span a wide range, from a benign, slowly
growing inborn lesion to highly malignant
glioblastomas. To date, 68 unrelated pedigrees or
individuals with p 5 3 germline mutations have been
described (15 and T. Soussi, personal communication; Kleihues, manuscript in preparation). For

half of t h e m , a t least o n e individual has been
diagnosed with a brain tumour. Nine of the pedigrees
show more than one brain tumour case (5, 6, 16-20).
In 6 families two individuals developed a brain
tumour and three families have three members with
a brain tumour. Recently, Kyritsis and coworkers (18)
uncovered a n exceptionally high frequency of
germline m u t a t i o n s i n patients affected with
multifocal glioma, glioma a n d secondary
malignancies, glioma and a family history of cancer,
or all three risk factors combined. However, in none
of t h e published pedigrees with p 5 3 germline
mutations are brain tumours t h e predominant
neoplasm.
The deletion of codon 236 in exon 7 of the p53 gene
leads to the loss of tyrosine in the gene product
which is located i n the second loop of the P53
protein that binds to DNA within the minor groove
(21). This codon has been reported to be affected by
point mutations in a variety of sporadic tumours,
and in one case was part of a larger deletion (22). The
predominant mutational type in both somatic and
germline p53 mutations are missense mutations.
Deletions are less frequent and usually change the
genetic reading frame, producing truncated proteins
(2, 23). However, the deletion mutation detected in
this study is in frame, i.e. a n untruncated gene
product is likely to be synthesized. Accordingly,
reverse transcription and PCR of the mRNA derived
from the glioblastoma from Patient I11 A yielded
mutant cDNA. Sequence analysis of the p53 gene in
this tumour suggested loss of the wild-type allele,

hence indicating that the P53 accumulated in the
tumour cell nuclei is the product of the mutant
allele.
The unusual association of this p 5 3 germline
mutation with a familial brain tumour syndrome
allows some speculations on possible organ-specific
properties of this novel deletion mutant. There is
evidence that not all alterations of the p53 gene lead
t o abolished function but instead may confer a
mutation dependent gain of function and thereby
provide a growth advantage to tumour cells (24).
These i n vitro assessed functional properties
encompass the ability of mutant P53 proteins to
transactivate reporter genes, to bind to cellular or
viral proto-oncogenes or to increase tumorigenic
potential of cells lacking endogenous p 5 3
(summarized in 24, 25). However, tissue-specific
properties of distinct p53 mutations have not been
described, and the mutational hot spot, codon 249
observed in certain liver tumours is thought to reflect
t h e involvement of a specific e n v i r o n m e n t a l
carcinogen, i.e., aflatoxin B 1 (26, 27). Furthermore,
p53 mutations in brain tumours (9, 28) or in the
germline of kindreds with brain tumours have not
been reported to display an organ specific mutation
clustering at certain sites of the gene. Monitoring
p53 knockout mice of different genetic background
indicated that loss of function enforces a prior strain
specific tumour predisposition reflected in both the
rate and the spectrum of tumours developing (29).
Furthermore, no mouse model exists for a potential
gain of function p53 mutant that exhibits organ

specific tumorigenic properties (30). However, tissue
specific expression of a p53 transgene mediated by
intron sequences has been reported (31).
In all brain tumour-derived DNA of the presented
kindred, the sequencing patterns of exon 7 indicated
the loss of the wild-type allele in contrast to the
white blood cells in which both the wild-type and
mutant allele were present (Figs. 5, 6). Loss of the
wild-type allele has been frequently observed in
tumours t h a t arose in carriers of p 5 3 germline
mutation (32) as well as in sporadic tumours (33-35)
and has been associated with tumour progression
(36). This is consistent with the concept of tumour
suppressor gene function (37). The adrenocortical
carcinoma of patient I1 D contained two mutations,
the deletion of codon 236 and a point mutation in
exon 8, (C->T, Arg -> Cys, codon 273) as reported
earlier (14). With paraffin-embedded tissue as the
only source of DNA, we could n o t determine
whether both mutations were located on the same
allele. Sequence analysis at codon 273 (exon 8)
indicated loss of t h e second allele (14), while
sequence analysis adjacent to codon 236 (exon 7)
exhibited both, the wild-type allele and the allele
containing the deletion mutation. This discrepancy
could be d u e t o t u m o u r heterogeneity or
contamination with non-neoplastic tissue. Zhang et
al. (38) reported the frequent occurrence of tandem
or even multiple mutations in the p 5 3 gene of
pontine gliomas of juvenile onset. Otherwise, double
mutations are rare except for nonmelanoma skin
tumours, which in 4SYo carry a second mutation,
usually without loss of heterozygosity (39). It was
concluded that UV-light exposure increases the
probability of a second mutational event.
Astrocytic brain tumours, WHO grade I1 to IV exhibit
an apparent grade independent frequency of p53
mutations (9, 28) suggesting t h a t this genetic
alteration represents a fairly early event during
carcinogenesis. However, other studies found this
alteration prevalent in high-grade gliomas, and
emphasized its importance in the progression from
low-grade tumors (40-42). The early onset of the
astrocytic brain tumors observed in this family in
association with a p53 germline mutation represents
another important indication for the significance of
p53 alterations early in carcinogenesis of this tumour
type.
In conclusion, the family described in this report
offers an exceptional insight into the wide range of
adverse biological effects of an unusual 953 germline
mutation. The results obtained led to an effective
genetic counseling and a probable termination of the
disease after the third generation.
