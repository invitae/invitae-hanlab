We detected a germ-line mutation of the p53
ABSTRACT
gene in a patient with a malignant ependymoma of the posterior
fossa. This mutation, which was found at codon 242, resulted
in an amino acid substitution in a highly conserved site of exon
7 of the p53 gene; the same mutation was found in both the
germ-line and the tumor tissue. This is the most common region
of previously described somatic p53 mutations in tumor specimens and of the germ-line p53 mutations in patients with the
Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome. Evaluation of the patient's
family revealed several direct maternal and paternal relatives
who had died at a young age from different types of cancer. The
association of a germ-line p53 mutation with an intracranial
malignancy and a strong family history of cancer suggests that
p53 gene mutations predispose a person to malignancy and, like
retinoblastoma mutations, may be inherited.

Tumor-suppressor genes, recessive oncogenes that are associated with a variety of human cancers (1), were initially
detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP) analyses showing deletion of specific chromosome
sequences (2). Recently, studies have shown both deletion
and mutation of the p53 gene (human gene symbol, TP53) on
chromosome 17 in several different types of tumors (3, 4).
These and related findings (5, 6) have established that the p53
gene has tumor-suppressor activity like that of the retinoblastoma gene (RB), the prototype of a recessive oncogene.
Whereas inherited and somatically acquired mutations of RB
were initially identified in specimens of peripheral blood as
well as tumor tissues from patients with retinoblastoma (7),
mutations ofthe p53 gene were shown primarily only in tumor
specimens (4). Recently, germ-line mutations of the p53 gene
have been detected in affected members from families with
the Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome (8, 9).
We have detected a germ-line mutation in the p53 gene in
a boy with an intracranial malignant ependymoma, a type of
brain tumor not previously reported to be part of the LiFraumeni series of tumors (10). The same mutation was found
in both the germ-line and the tumor tissue. This patient also
had a strong family history of cancer in both the maternal and
paternal kindreds, suggesting that the p53 gene mutation may
underlie the etiology of his tumor.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Molecular Genetic Tumor Studies. The patient, a 5-year-old
boy, presented with headache, nausea and vomiting, and
unsteady gait that had progressively worsened over a period
of several months. A contrast-enhanced computerized tomography scan showed a large mass arising from the floor of

the fourth ventricle. The patient underwent excision of the
tumor mass. Pathologic examination of the tumor specimen
showed features consistent with a low-grade ependymoma.
Although the patient also received postoperative radiation
therapy, the tumor recurred 2 years after surgery. A second
operation was performed, at which time specimens of peripheral blood (20 ml) and tumor tissue were obtained following protocols previously approved by the Human Sub-

jects Committee, Stanford University Medical Center.
Pathologic examination of these tumor specimens showed
features of a high-grade malignant ependymoma, consistent
with the relatively rapid regrowth of the mass. His condition
was stable for approximately 3-4 months, when the tumor
recurred, ultimately resulting in his death.
Leukocytes from the peripheral blood were separated by
centrifugation at 5000 x g for 15-20 min. The tumor specimen
was stored at -800C and was disaggregated manually at the
start of the experimental procedure. Genomic DNA was
extracted by published procedures (11). To determine
whether there was a deletion of DNA sequences in the tumor
specimen, RFLP analysis was performed using Southern blot
hybridization techniques (11, 12). We selected the following
probes from chromosome 17p because of our earlier results
showing deletion of DNA sequences from this chromosome
in medulloblastoma, another pediatric tumor of the posterior
fossa (12): 144D6 (17p13.3), YNZ22.1 (17p13.3), HRP5.5
(17pl3.1), Hp53b (p53 gene-17pl3.1), EW 503 (17p12),
MYH2 (17p12), and HF12-2 (17p12) (Howard Hughes Medical Institute Gene Mapping Data Base, Yale University,
1990). For electrophoresis, following digestion of the DNA,
samples from the leukocytes and the tumor were run in
adjacent lanes and the blood and tumor specimens were
compared to determine any difference in their respective
hybridization patterns for each of the probes. Absence of a
band in the tumor tissue that was seen in the leukocytes from
the same patient was scored as a deletion. The results were
confirmed by densitometric analysis (12).
DNA amplification by means of the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) was used in combination with screening of the
reaction products by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
(DGGE) to study the blood and tumor specimens for p53
mutations. PCRs were performed using each of four pairs of
oligodeoxynucleotide primers that were synthesized from
published sequence data to cover the entire evolutionarily
conserved region of the p53 gene (13). The primers were
modified by the addition of a 40-base-pair G+C-rich sequence ("G-C clamp"), which had previously been shown to
improve the sensitivity of the DGGE technique (14-16). The

primers** for exon 7 that proved to be informative were AOG
3 (5'-CGCCCGCCGCGCCCCGCCCGGCCCGCCGCCCCCGCCCGGGATCCGTGTTGTCTCCTAGGTTGGCT-3'; GC clamp at 5' end) and AOG 4 (5'-GCCGGAATTCCAAGTGGCTCCTGACCTGGA-3'). The PCR was performed using previously described variables (17).
DGGE was performed with gel conditions and an optimal
time of electrophoresis that were determined empirically
based on previous studies (16). The PCR samples were
prepared for DGGE by ethanol precipitation and resuspension in 30 1.l of 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5/1 mM EDTA/0.3 M
NaCl. The samples were then denatured at 950C for 5 min and
were reannealed at 580C for several hours, after which 10 ,.l
of each sample was added to 10 gl of orange G loading dye
and loaded on a DGGE apparatus. Electrophoresis was
performed at 160 V on a parallel gradient gel containing a
linear gradient of DNA denaturants ranging from 35% to 65%
[100%o denaturant = 7 M urea with 40%~(wt/vol) formamide]
at a constant temperature of 60'C for 8 hr. The gels were then
stained with ethidium bromide and photographed. The presence of a novel band and heteroduplex bands on the gels
indicated a gene mutation (14-17).
Multiple isolates of the p53 gene defined by the primers
AOG 3 and 4 were subcloned and sequenced by standard
methods (18, 19). A modified bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase, United States Biochemical) and
[a-[35S]thio]dATP were used for the sequencing reactions.
The four termination-reaction mixtures were then heated to
750C for 2 min and loaded on an 8% polyacrylamide gel
containing 7 M urea. Electrophoresis was then performed at
60-W constant power for 3-6 hr, after which the gel was dried
for 1 hr at 80°C and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film for 36 hr.
The sequence for the fragment of the p53 gene defined by the
primers was read from the gel and was compared with the
published data for the p53 gene (7).
Family Studies. Historical information obtained from the
patient's maternal and paternal relatives included the sex of
family members, their current age or age at death, history of
a cancer diagnosis, and cause of death. Diagnoses of cancer
were verified with an examination of records and pathologic
specimens whenever possible. In addition, molecular genetic
studies were performed on peripheral blood specimens from
paternal family members who were available for venipuncture. Early death from cancer of many younger relatives on
the maternal side of the kindred limited the available data. No
maternal relatives were available for molecular genetic analyses, nor were we able to obtain tissue blocks from those who
had died. The family members studied were those identified
in the pedigree as III-K; IV-J, -K, -L, and -M; and V-D, -E,
and -F (Fig. 1). Peripheral blood (20-30 ml) was obtained
from each person, and DNA was extracted as described (11).
The DNA was then used for PCR amplification of exon 7 of
the p53 gene followed by screening by DGGE.
DNA obtained from the blood of the available paternal
relatives was analyzed to investigate the possible inheritance
of the p53 gene mutation shown in the patient. Southern blots
were prepared and hybridized with probes from chromosome
17p. In an attempt to identify the pattern of inheritance of the
p53 gene region of chromosome 17p for the patient, a
comparison was made of the allelic fragments obtained after
hybridization for each informative probe tested against the
DNA from each family member.
RESULTS
RFLP studies showed preservation of both alleles of all of the
informative chromosome 17p probes tested against the DNA

from the patient's leukocyte and tumor specimens. In particular, no deletions of the p53 gene were detected. The
combined PCR-DGGE analysis, however, showed a mutation at codon 242 in exon 7 of the p53 gene in both the blood
and tumor tissue of the patient. The mutation was detected on
the denaturing gradient gel by the presence of a novel band
and novel heteroduplex bands (Fig. 2A). The patient was
heterozygous for the p53 mutation in the peripheral blood.
Sequencing of the p53 exon 7 fragment confirmed this result
(Fig. 2B). The mutation is a substitution of an adenine for a
guanine, resulting in the replacement of a cysteine residue by
a tyrosine residue. The site of the mutation in exon 7 is highly
conserved across species (Fig. 3) and is one of the most
common sites of p53 mutation in many types of neoplasms (4,
20) as well as in the blood and tumor tissue of affected family
members with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (8, 9).
No p53 gene mutations were detected in the DNA from
available paterpal family members who were screened with
the combined PCR-DGGE technique. The chromosome 17p
markers tested against those same DNA specimens gave no
information to resolve whether the mutation was inherited or
arose spontaneously. The lack of either fresh or archival
tissue from the maternal family members therefore precluded
verification of the origin of this germ-line p53 gene mutation.

DISCUSSION
We analyzed the p53 gene because previous studies have
shown mutations in a variety of tumors in which deletions of
chromosome 17p are well documented (3, 4), findings that
project an important role of the p53 gene in human neoplasia
(4, 20, 21). Studies such as those documenting the transformation of early-passage rodent cells by the p53 gene in
cooperation with the ras oncogene suggested that the primary
activity of the p53 protein was growth stimulation (5, 22).
Subsequently, however, it was determined that those initial
investigations were performed with a mutated version of the
gene (5). The wild-type p53 protein has since been shown to
be growth-suppressive, most recently in transfection experiments performed in colon cancer and glioblastoma cell lines
(23, 24).
Although studies of breast cancer biopsy specimens that
overexpressed a mutated p53 protein in a tumor-specific
fashion suggested a role for the gene in human neoplasia (5,
25), a significant role for mutant p53 proteins was shown by
molecular genetic analysis of colorectal cancer (3, 26). Deletion of the region of chromosome 17p containing the p53
gene was first detected with RFLP analysis in a large percentage of colorectal cancer specimens (26). Thereafter,
PCR-based amplification studies of the p53 gene in colorectal
cancer detected frequent point mutations, both in specimens
that, with RFLP analysis, showed deletion of p53 alleles and,
later, in the specimens in which both p53 alleles appeared to
be preserved (3).
Our study shows a germ-line p53 gene mutation in a patient
who developed an intracranial ependymoma. The mutation
was detected in one of the four regions where p53 mutations
are clustered ("hot spots"), sites that have been observed in
colorectal, breast, lung, and adult brain tumors and that
correspond to highly evolutionarily conserved exons of the
p53 gene (4, 20, 21). Although definitive proof of altered gene
function resulting from a mutation requires an assay of
cellular transformation, the identification of a germ-line p53
mutation provides strong circumstantial evidence for its role
in the etiology of our patient's tumor. At present, the
mechanism by which mutation of the p53 gene results in
neoplastic transformation has not been established. Transgenic mice produced from mutant p53 gene constructs show
a phenotype consisting of several different kinds of tumors
(6). Studies using a temperature-sensitive mutant p53 con-

only small amounts of genomic DNA, which can be obtained
from materials ranging from needle biopsy specimens of
tumor tissues to archival paraffin-embedded human specimens. Cancer family pedigrees can therefore be screened
rapidly with the use of the PCR-DGGE technique for p53 and
other tumor-suppressor gene mutations, provided that sufficient tumor tissues are available for study. We therefore hope
that this work serves not only to identify a germ-line p53 gene
mutation but also to act as a reminder to preserve archival
specimens for such future investigations.

struct have shown that the cellular proliferation and transformation induced by the gene is lost when the permissive
temperature is raised and is restored when the temperature is
lowered. This finding suggests that p53 activity may be
reversible (27). A strong transcription-activating sequence in
the amino-terminal part of the protein has also been detected,
suggesting that p53 may activate an inhibitor of cellular
proliferation genes (28).
Several familial cancer syndromes have been reported in
which there is a high incidence of brain tumors associated
with other types of neoplasms (29). In Li-Fraumeni syndrome, there is a predisposition to sarcomas, leukemias,
breast and colon cancers, and gliomas of the brain (10), and
affected individuals have been shown to harbor germ-line
mutations of the p53 gene in exon 7 (8, 9). Although the
members of our kindred did not show an increased incidence
of the most common tumors in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, one
of the family members (IV-N) developed an osteogenic
sarcoma and several members (III-E, III-I, and V-C) had
brain tumors. The detection of a p53 mutation in the family
at exon 7 suggests that there is overlap of the family's
pedigree with the more classic type of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Moreover, as ependymomas of the brain are not
typically part of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, our results
suggest that the syndrome may include other types of tumors.
The finding of a germ-line p53 mutation in the member of
a cancer family kindred whom we describe, as well as the
recent studies on several Li-Fraumeni kindreds (8, 9), suggest that, like mutations of RB, inherited mutations of the p53
gene can result in malignancy. Our results provide additional
incentive to examine exon 7 of the p53 gene whenever
Li-Fraumeni syndrome is suspected.
The PCR-DGGE combination technique allows rapid
screening of DNA mutations in all types of tissue specimens.
The specificity of the DGGE technique in detecting single
base-pair mutations, particularly with the use of the G-C
clamp, has been well documented (15, 16). The PCR requires
