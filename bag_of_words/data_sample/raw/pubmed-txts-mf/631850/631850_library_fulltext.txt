Summary. This paper describes two families in which four boys and two girls
were affected with geroderma osteodysplastica. The major features of this
syndrome include a droopy, jowly, prematurely aged appearance that has
been likened by previous authors to the dwarfs in Walt Disney's 'Snow
White.' Also, their skin lacks normal elastic recoil. The bones are osteoporotic
and susceptible to fractures, particularly the vertebrae, which show compression with anterior wedging and biconcavity. The findings in the present
families are compared with those in the originally reported family. There was
a high degree of consanguinity between the parents in both of the present
families and the previous hypothesis of X-linked inheritance is questioned.

In 1949 Bamatter et al. coined the term 'geroderma osteodysplastica h&6ditaire'
to describe a Swiss family with lax, wrinkled skin, osteoporosis, and a marked
susceptibility to fractures. This same family has since been reviewed by Bamatter
et al. (1950), Franceschetti (1953), Brocher et al. (1968), Klein et al. (1968), and
Boreux (1969). The major features of the syndrome in this family included: thin,
creased skin with decreased turgidity and elasticity, most marked over the hands
and feet; a sad-looking face with droopy eyelids and jowly appearance, malocclusion, delayed dental eruption, and a high palate, a span greater than height;
dislocated hips; and joint laxity, especially of the hands and feet but also of the
knees and sternoclavicular joint. Intelligence was normal. Radiologic findings
included generalized osteoporosis, frequent compression fractures, occasional biconcavity of the vertebrae, and minor variations of the ossification centres at the
wrist. All affected family members were related through unaffected women and
X-linked inheritance with occasional manifestation in females was postulated.
This paper reports six children, from two additional families, affected with
this rare condition. Three of the affected children in the first family were
previously reported by Pieron (1968) as having 'Dislocation of hip associated
with hypotonia.'

Case Reports
Family 1
The pedigree of this Dutch-Russian-Mennonite family is shown in Figure 1. The parents of the
proband (V-4) are double second cousins and three of their eight children are affected with
geroderma osteodysplastica. A second cousin (V-10) is also affected. There is no other family
history of susceptibility to fractures, dislocated hips, or skin abnormalities.

Patient V-4 (M. DO. This boy was the first born of dizygotic twins. The term pregnancy was
complicated by minimal bleeding during the third month and by breech presentation. Birth
weight, length, and head circumference were not available. Hyperextensible joints and loose
skin were noted at birth. Bilateral dislocation at the hips was diagnosed at age 9 months and was
treated successfully with a hip spica. Walking and other early motor milestones were delayed,
but development of other milestones has been within normal limits; he has always done very
well at school. Marked joint hyperextensibility was noted at the time of initial assessment and
has previously been reported in detail (Pieron, 1968).
At 91°/12years of age he was admitted to the Health Sciences Children's Centre with compression fractures of several thoracic vertebrae that were caused by jumping down from a
tractor. Numerous physical measurements were obtained at that time and are available on
request. Except for a less than mean upper-segment/lower segment ratio (0.87), a high cephalic
index (0.98) due to a relatively wide biparietal diameter and low-set ears, all those measurements
were within normal limits (Feingold and Bossert, 1974; Lubchenco et al., 1966; Preus, 1976). At
that time he looked older than his chronological age and had a droopy facial appearance with
prominent jowls, malar flattening, relative prognathism and rosy cheeks (Fig. 2 c). His skull was
square with a prominent forehead, two parietal whorls, one right anterior whorl, a widow's
peak, and hair or normal texture. The palpebral fissures were horizontal, the funduscopic and
ocular examination normal, and a mild degree of ptosis was present. His mandible was of
normal size and shape, whereas the palate, although of normal height, appeared narrow because
of prominent lateral palatal ridges. There was a marked Angle Type III dental malocclusion.
His ears appeared to be large, but were normal by measurement. However, they were low-set
(Feingold and Bossert, 1974) and the increased biparietal diameter of the skull caused them to
be directly slightly downward when viewed from the front (Fig. 2c).
A Grade I I / V I early systolic ejection murmur was heard over the left sternal border which
radiated to the left axilla. This murmur was considered fuctional. The abdomen and genitalia
were normal. Marked hyperextensibility was noted at the metacarpophalangeal, 'interphalangeal (Fig. 3 a), and knee joints, but this appeared to be less severe than that noted during
infancy (Pieron, 1968). There was mild winging of the scapulae. Overall muscle strength was
normal. The skin appeared older than expected for a boy of his age, particularly in the area over
the dorsum of the hands. Recoil of tented skin was markedly delayed (Fig. 3 b) but there was no
abnormal scar tissue, increased skin fragility, or easy bruisability. An excess .of fine creases
('white lines') was noted on the palms and soles although the dermatoglyphics were otherwise
-unremarkable. The nails were normal. The veins over the dorsum of the hands were prominent
(Fig. 3 b) but the skin was not transparent.

Patient V-3 (G. DO. This boy was born at 40 weeks gestation weighing 3827 g. Pregnancy and
delivery were normal. Generalized joint laxity and wrinkly skin were noted at birth, and at age
23 months he was diagnosed as having one dislocated and one subluxated hip. At this time his
anterior fontanelle was still open, coxa valga was noted, and a healed fracture of the sixth rib
and generalized bone demineralization were observed. There was marked joint hyperextensibility, which has been reported previously in detail (Pieron, 1968).
On examination at age 114/12years he was of normal intelligence and appeared much older
than his chronological age (Figs. 2 b and 4 b). Except for an arm span that was significantly less
than his height and slightly decreased upper/lower body segment ratio (0.89), all physical
measurements recorded were normal, (Details available on request.) His head was brachycephalic with a square, slightly prominent forehead, but with less relative increase in his

biparietal diameter than seen in his siblings. He had a right, clockwise parietal whorl, a widow's
peak, and hair of normal texture. His face was droopy and jowly with rosy cheeks, mild ptosis of
the upper eyelids, malar flatness, maxillary hypoplasia, and a promient, downturned lower lip.
The palate was narrow due to prominent palatal shelves and marked maxillary hypoplasia.
There was a severe Angle Type III dental malocclusion and relative prognathism. The ears had
the same downward slope seen in his brother (Fig. 2 b) and although they looked large, were
normal by measurement. The cardiovascular and abdominal examinations and external
genitalia were normal.
The metacarpophalangeal, interphalangeal, and knee joints were hyperextensible although
this appeared to be less than at an earlier age (Pieron, 1968). Loose patellae, winged scapulae,
pes cavus, and slightly increased lumbar lordosis were noted. Muscular strength was normal.
There was an increased space between the first and second toes and slight clinodactyly of the
second toe of both feet. There was a generalized excess of fine skin creases and although elastic-

ity was normal, there was reduced recoil after stretching, which was most marked on the dorsum
of the hands. The nails were normal. The palms showed an increased number of white lines, but
the dermatoglyphics were otherwise normal. Careful physical examination showed no other
major or minor abnormalities.

Patient Vo6 (A. D.). This girl was the product of a full-term normal pregnancy, labor, and
delivery. Her birth weight was 3402 g. Joint laxity and loose skin were present at birth. Bilateral
dislocation at the hips was noted at 9 months of age and walking was delayed. All other
milestones were normal and she is doing well at school.
When reexamined at 6m/i2 years of age, she appeared older than her chronological age with a
facies very similar to that of her brothers (Figs. 2 a and 4 a). Numerous physical measurements
were made (available on request) and only the foot length was abnormal (>97%tile). Her head
was square with a broad forehead and increased biparietal diameter. The hair was blonde and of
normal texture with a right clockwise parietal whorl. The eyes were normal except for mild
tortuosity of the retinal vessels and minimal ptosis. The nose was bulbous and the malar area
flat. She had jowly cheeks, a downturned lower lip, and a prominent mandible. The palate was
of normal height but appeared narrow because of prominent lateral palatal shelves. Her ears
had the same downward insertion seen in her brothers (Fig. 2a) and, although they looked
large, were of normal length. Her cardiovascular and abdominal examinations, and external
genitalia were normal. The skin showed a generalized increase in fine creases and a slow recoil
of tented skin, most marked on the dorsum of the hands. The skin of the palm was moist and

316

velvety, and palms and soles showed an increase of white lines. The first and second toes were
widely spaced. The first toes were narrow and the second showed clinodactyly. The metacarpophalangeal, interphalangeal, wrist, elbow, and knee joints were hyperextensible. Her scapulae
were winged and she had bilateral pes cavus. The dermatoglyphic patterns were normal. Careful
physical examination failed to show any additional major or minor abnormalities.

Patient V-lO (1".P.). This girl is a second and a double third cousin of the 'D' children, and her
parents are themselves second and third cousins (Fig. 1). She weighed 3200 g at birth, following
a pregnancy complicated by hemorrhage during the third month. She lacked full extension at
the elbows, was hyperextensible at all other joints, and had lax, wrinkled skin that gave her an
aged appearance. Bilateral dislocation at the hips was diagnosed at age 9 months and was
treated by splinting. At age 14 months she sustained fractures of the distal right tibia and fibula
after minimal trauma.
She was first seen at the age of 15 months when the parents returned from Mexico and she
was admitted to hospital for treatment of her dislocated hips. She appeared older than her
chronological age and had a facies similar to her cousins. Except for her weight and chest
circumference, which were less then the 3%tile, and an increased cephalic index (0.81) due to a
relatively wide biparietal diameter, all measurements were within normal limits (available on
request). She had a prominent, square forehead with a right clockwise parietal hair whorl. The
ears were prominent and angled downwards, and the cheeks were droopy with flat malar areas.
She had ptosis of the upper eyelids, the typical 'Walt Disney' nose, prominent palatal shelves, a
downturned lower lip, and two lower central incisors that were malaligned. There was a mild
pectus excavatum and a slight convex left scoliosis. All joints were hyperextensible, and her skin
was generally lax, wrinkled, and lacked normal turgot. There was mild ulnar deviation of the
fingers, the nails were hyperconvex, and there was an excess of white lines on the palms and
soles.

Family 2
Only the proband in this Mennonite family was available for examination at the time of this
study. The pedigree (Fig. 1) was drawn from the best available information. Both affected boys
are reported to be the products of incest between siblings. However, it is possible that the
p r o b a n d (1II-3) may have been fathered by the grandfather.

Patient 111-3 (J. B.). This boy was born at term following an uncomplicated pregnancy and
delivery. At birth he weighed 3190 g, was 48.5 cm long, and had a head circumference of 32 cm.
He was described as hypotonic with lax, wrinkled skin, and an aged appearance. He had slight
restriction of extension at the knees and elbows, but all other joints were hyperextensible and
there was bilateral dislocation at the hips, which remained subluxated despite treatment in a hip
spica from age 4 months to 2 years. Bilateral inguinal heriae were noted shortly after birth, and
a convex left scoliosis was noted at 20 months of age and has been treated by bracing. Developmental milestones were delayed and he first walked at 28 months. At a chronological age of
39 months he was assessed on the Yale Developmental Scale as functioning at a 28-month level
with his language approaching a 36-month level.
On examination at 34/~2years of age he appeared older than his chronological age with a
facies characteristic of geroderma osteodysplastica (Fig. 2 d). Numerous physical measurements
were made and are available on request. Except for an increased cephalic index (0.84) due to a
relatively high biparietal diameter, all measurements fell at or around the 3%tile. The forehead
was broad and square. He had fine, blond hair, a right-sided clockwise parietal whorl, and a
normal posterior hairline. There was ptosis of the upper eyelids, malar flatness, and droopy
cheeks. The upper lip overlapped the downturned lower lip (Fig. 4 c). The palate appeared high
due to prominent palatal shelves, there was a severe Angle Type III dental malocclusion, and
the mandible was prominent. His ears were prominent and of normal length. They were low-set
and had the same downward angulation seen in the other children (Fig. 2 d). He had a thoracic
kyphoscoliosis with mild pectus excavatum and marked wrinkling of the skin over the chest and

Geroderma Osteodysplastica

317

abdomen. He had a Grade II/VI functional murmur. The left testis was in the inguinal canal.
He had generalized joint hyperextensibility and the kneecaps could be easily dislocated laterally.
He had mild ulnar deviation of the fingers and pes cavus. There was marked loss of skin turgor,
most marked over the dorsum of the hands. The veins were prominent over the dorsum of the
hands and feet. There was an excess of white lines on the palms and soles, but the dermatoglyphics were otherwise remarkable. The nails of the hands and feet were slightly hyperconvex.

Patient Ili-2 (11.B.). This boy was not available for examination at the time of this study. He was
born at term following a normal pregnancy and delivery. At birth he weighed 2550g, had a
length of 51 cm and a head circumference of 32 cm. His skin was described as wrinkled and
aged-looking but was not hyperelastic. He had some limitation of extension at the knees and
elbows but all other joints were reported to be hyperextensible and there was bilateral dislocation at the hips. Other physical signs included: a third fontanelle, epicanthic folds, large
low-set ears, a high arched palate, a small mandible, ulnar deviation of the fingers, and undescended testes. A mild convex r!ght scliosis was noted at 8 months. The hip dislocations did
not respond to closed reduction and femoral osteotomies were carried out at 11 months of age.
He had a clinically significant umbilical hernia. He is now reported to be at the 50%tile for
height and weight and is considered to be functioning at the low normal range. The restriction at
the elbows and knees has resolved and he continues to have joint hyperextensibility. He has
severe dental malocclusion that requires orthodontic management. Photographs showed an
appearance characteristic of geroderma osteodysplastica.
Other Family Members. No other members of this family were available for examination. However, all four parents and the two grandparents were reported normal and in good health.
Laboratory Studies. All six children had normal hemoglobin levels, total white cell count and
differential, serum electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase. Normal studies
carried out on some but not all patients included: magnesium, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen,
serum creatine phosphokinase, serum cholesterol, total serum protein and protein electrophoresis, lipoprotein electrophoresis, thyroxine, ceruloplasmin, serum a-l-antitrypsin, urinary
screen for mucopolysaccharides, urine amino acid chromatography, and urinary 17-hydroxy and
17-ketosteroids. Electromyography, nerve conduction studies, electrocardiography, electroencephalography, echocardiography (V-4 only), and chromosome studies with Q-banding were
also normal.
Serum copper was slightly elevated in V-4 (1481ag/dl, normal: 94--134) and in V-6
(150 ~g/dl). Serum triglycerides were slightly elevated in V-4 (163 pg/dl, normali50-- 150) and
in V-6 (1741xg/dl).
Muscle, nerve, and skin biopsies from the three 'D' children in the first family and a muscle
biopsy from 1II-2 showed no histologic abnormalities. In particular there was no identifiable
abnormality of collagen or elastic tissue (Verhoeff's stain). Electron microscopic studies of
muscle and skin in patient V-4 were normal.

concave deformities of their end plates

All six children had dislocated of the hips in infancy and after successful
treatment all five who were walking developed coxa valga. At age 9months V-6
also showed bilateral subluxation at the knees.
Metacarpophalangeal profiles (Poznanski, 1974) were tabulated for the five
patients available at the time of the study and no characteristic profile was seen.
The bone ages were normal (Greulich and Pyle, 1959).
Skull films showed normal pituitary fossae (McCarten and Kuhns, i976),
cranial volumes, and thickness of the cranial vaults. All six patients had multiple
wormian bones in the lambdoid suture (Fig. 6).
There was posterior displacement of the maxilla and some degree of relative
prognathism in the five eldest patients. These findings were confirmed by
cephalometric analysis in the three children from the first family who where old

enough for accurate study (Fig. 6). It might also appear with increasing age in the
youngest child (V-10). The measurements of V-6 and V-3 were definitely
abnormal and those of V-4 were borderline (Silverman, 1976). In the five oldest
children the tooth-bearing alveolar bone of the mandible was diminished (Fig. 7)
and in V-6 there was also evidence of mechanical retention of the first molars. The
dental age was within normal limits in all six children. Intravenous pyelograms in
III-2 and III-3 were normal.
Cephalomeric analysis, skeletal surveys, and metacarpophalangeal profiles of
both parents of the 'D' children (Family 1) were all normal. Cephalomeric
analysis of one of their unaffected children was also normal.

Discussion

The clinical findings in the affected members of the original and the present
families are listed in Table 1. Our six patients demonstrate all the major features
of the condition, in particular: congenital geroderma, resulting in an appearance
older than chronological age; lax skin with decreased recoil; a droopy, jowly face
that has aptly been likened to the dwarfs in Walt Disney's 'Snow White';
mandibular prognathism with mid-face retrusion; marked and generalized joint
hyperextensibility; joint subluxation and dislocation at the hips; and generalized
osteoporosis with a tendency to fracture bones after minimal trauma. All four
children in the first family had compression, anterior wedging, and biconcave
deformities of the end plates of the vertebral bodies. Neither boy in the second
family showed these changes, but they might develop with age. The frequency of
vertebral compression and of linear densities parallel to the end plates of the
vertebrae was not as great in our patients as in those described by Brocher et al.
(1968). Description of further cases will be required to determine more corn~pletely the full spectrum and the relative frequencies of the manifestations of this
condition.
Other clinical features, including premature arcus senilis, high eyebrows, mild
mandibular hypoplasia, narrow, chest, and minor digital and carpal anomalies
were reported in some members of the original family but were not seen in our
patients. We believe that the increased span/height ratio reported in the original
family (Boreux, 1969), and the decreased upper-segment/lower segment ratio
seen in two of our patients represent a degree of vertebral body collapse. Notably,
the patients in the original report are older than ours, and it will be important to
see if vertebral collapse increases with age in our patients.
The genetic aspects of geroaerma osteodysplastica are interesting. The five
affected members in the original family were from three sibships and related
through unaffected women. This led the authors (Bamatter et al., 1950; Boreux,
1969) and others (Gorlin, 1976; McKusick, 1975) to postulate X-linked recessive
inheritance with occasional manifestation in fdmales. However, the severity of the
condition was similar in affected females and affected males, and the 'obligatory
female carriers' showed no manifestations of the condition. One woman was
described as having a characteristic face and large hands, but she had neither the
bony nor the skin changes of the condition, and her appearance may have been

simply due to familial resemblance (D. Klein, personal communication, 1976). An
all-or-none clinical expression in females is unusual for conditions with X-linked
recessive inheritance. Instead, one expects to see partial expression of the
condition in female carriers with variation of the clinical manifestations from
very mild to moderately severe.
It is possible that geroderma osteodysplastica is not an X-linked recessive but
an autosomal recessive condition. Against ' X-linked recessive inheritance in our
cases are the following facts: the girls were as severely affected as the boys, none
of the four mothers were affected, and there was no connection between the two
sibships in Family 1 that did not involve an unaffected male. In support of autosomal recessive inheritance is the fact that the two sibships in the first family are
connected through both paternal and maternal sides to the great-great-grandparents (I-1 and I-2), and that both boys in the second family resulted from incest
between siblings. It is of interest that the original families came from a highly
inbred region where about 50% of the marriages are consanguineous (D. Klein,
personal communication, 1976).
Geroderma osteodysplastica has a number of features in common with other
disorders of connective tissue but it appears to represent a distinct entity. It is
most likely to be confused with nonspecific cutis laxa or other cutis laxa
syndromes. There are both autosomal dominant and recessive forms of cutis laxa
(Beighton, 1972) that generally have more marked skin involvement than geroderma osteodysplastica and with rare exceptions (Sesak, 1962) lack significant
joint hyperextensibility, hip dislocation, osteoporosis, vertebral compression and
fractures. Histologically our cases differ from cutis laxa (McKusick, 1972).
Patients with acrogeria have wrinkled and aged-appearing skin at birth, which
is most marked over the dorsum of the hands and feet (Elefant et al., 1965). A
generalized and a localized form of this disease have been recognized (Lamy et al.,
1961). Flat feet, dislocated hips, and mild micrognathia are common in agrogeria.
However, in contradistinction to geroderma osteodysplastica, there is skin
atrophy with highly visible superficial veins. Persons with acrogeria frequently
have wide cranial sutures, blue sclera, transparent dental enamel, mild distal
radial abnormalities, diaphyseal narrowing, and nail dysplasia, while they lack
the full jowly face, ptosis, dental malocclusion, joint hyperextensibility, and the
osteoporotic bony changes seen in geroderma osteodysplastica.
The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are an etiologically and clinically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by abnormal skin elasticity, joint mobility,
and tissue fragility (McKusick, 1972). These disorders are readily distinguished
from geroderma osteodysplastica on the basis of differences in the skin abnormalities and absence of bony changes.
A number of relatively less well-known but apparently distinct syndromes
also show unusually lax or wrinkled skin. However, each of these disorders has a
specific pattern of associated findings and none demonstrates the bony changes
seen in geroderma osteodysplastica (Dallaire et al., 1976; Debre et al., 1937; Gazit
et al., 1973; Kaye et al., 1974; Hoefnagel et al., 1971).
Of the large number of syndromes with osteoporosis (Taybi, 1975), such as
idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis, some are associated with biconcave vertebrae

Acknowledgements. We are grateful to Professor E. J. N. Briggs, Dr. E. Loadman and Dr. W. De
Groot who originally asked us to see M.D., J.B. and P.P. respectively. We would also like to
thank the D. and P. families for their cooperation and Mrs. D. Thompson who coordinated the
clinical visits. We are indepted to Dr. R. J. Gorlin and Professor D. Klein for their interest and
help. It would not have been possible to report the B. family without the help of the Children's
Aid Society of Manitoba and Mr. H. Neufeld in particular. Mrs. L. Gordon patiently typed the
many revisions of this manuscript.
