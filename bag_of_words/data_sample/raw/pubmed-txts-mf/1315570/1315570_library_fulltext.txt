Diagnosis of Heterozygous
Familial Hypercholesterolemia
DNA Analysis Complements
Clinical Examination and
Analysis of Serum Lipid Levels
Pekka V.I. Koivisto, Ulla-Maija Koivisto, Tatu A. Miettinen, and Kimmo Kontula
The concordance of clinical and molecular genetic diagnoses of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) was studied in 65 subjects (10 propositi and 55 first-degree relatives) from 10 families with FH.
Nine propositi were carriers of the FH-Helsinki deletion of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor
gene, prevalent in the Finnish population, while a new deletion, extending from intron 14 to intron 15 of
the LDL receptor gene, was identified in one family. Serum LDL cholesterol levels used in the clinical
diagnosis (<5.0 mmol/1, not FH; 5.0-5.9 mmol/l, possible FH; 2:6.0 mmol/1, FH; limits are 1 mmol/1 lower
for those <18 years) were derived from an authoritative recommendation. Tendon xanthomas constituted
an additional criterion. With the DNA analysis as the reference, 55 (85%) subjects could be correctly
classified clinically as FH patients or subjects without FH. The remaining 10 subjects were misclassified
or were in the "possible FH" category. When the age- and sex-specific 95th percentile LDL cholesterol
levels were used instead of the rigid values for both adults and children, the percentage of correct
diagnoses rose to 95%. Common genetic polymorphisms of apolipoproteins E and B did not markedly
affect LDL cholesterol levels in FH patients, whereas increasing age and obesity were associated with
elevated LDL levels. In conclusion, DNA analysis is a valuable adjunct to the diagnosis of FH that is
applicable to families with a known mutation of the LDL receptor gene. If DNA methods are not available,
age- and sex-specific LDL levels should be used as an aid in the clinical diagnosis of FH. (Arteriosclerosis

ecent developments in the treatment of hyperlipidemias have led to an increasing need for
systematic recommendations for the recognition and management of these disorders.1-2 The diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) has relied on
its principal clinical features: elevated serum total and
low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations, the presence of tendon xanthomas and premature
coronary heart disease (CHD), and similar findings in a
first-degree relative.3 FH is caused by a mutation of the
LDL receptor gene, resulting in the defective functioning and/or a diminished number of LDL receptors in
the hepatic and other cells, which in turn is accompanied by the slow receptor-mediated catabolism of LDL
and the accumulation of LDL in the circulation.3"5 FH

is inherited in an autosomal codominant way, with the
prevalence of heterozygous patients being approximately one in 500 in most populations.3
The phenotypic expression of heterozygous FH depends on exogenous factors, including diet6 and the use
of hypolipidemic drugs, as well as genetic polymorphism
of the ligands for the LDL receptor, i.e., apolipoproteins E and B.7-8 In one family, a putative "cholesterol
lowering gene" was found to even normalize serum
LDL cholesterol levels of the known carriers of the LDL
receptor gene mutation.9 All these findings call for
unequivocal diagnostic methods for FH.
A cell-biological diagnosis of FH may be accomplished by studying LDL binding, internalization, and
degradation by cultured fibroblasts3 or by lymphocyte
proliferation in response to mitogen administration as a
function of the prevailing LDL cholesterol concentration.1011 These methods are, however, technically very
demanding, and the use of hypolipidemic drugs may
interfere with lymphocyte culture assays. Use of molecular genetic techniques would constitute an ideal diagnostic approach for FH, with no interference by exogenous lipid-modulating factors. The multitude of LDL
receptor gene mutations, ranging from single nucleotide
changes to large deletions and insertions, limits the
usefulness of the DNA approach for the diagnosis of

FH in most populations.5 In some genetically homogeneous populations, such as Lebanese Christian Arabs,12
French-Canadians,13 and South African Afrikaners,14
one or a few LDL receptor gene mutations have been
enriched by a founder gene effect. The Finnish population is another example of a genetically homogeneous
population, and in fact, about 40% of the Finnish FH
patients carry the same type of LDL receptor gene
mutation.15-16 This mutation, designated as FH-Helsinki, deletes exons 16 and 17 and a portion of exon 18
of the LDL receptor gene and results in an internalization-defective phenotype of FH.15
The present study was conducted to clarify 1)
whether in given families with an established LDL
receptor gene mutation the conventional clinical criteria
of FH match with the molecular genetic diagnosis of
FH, 2) if any variation in LDL cholesterol levels could
be explained by genetic variation of apolipoproteins B
and E and whether their effects contribute to any
discrepancy between the clinical and the DNA diagnosis
of FH, and 3) whether any evidence in favor of the
existence of possible cholesterol-lowering gene(s) in FH
families could be provided.
Methods
Patients and Design of the Study
Ten propositi with large deletions of the LDL receptor gene and their first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, and children) were investigated. In addition, if
clinical data favored the diagnosis of FH ("FH" or
"possible FH"; see below) in a relative, the first-degree
relatives of the latter person were also invited to the
study. Very young children (<7 years of age) and
relatives living outside the Helsinki University Central
Hospital district were not invited.
The propositi were identified during an ongoing
screening of hypercholesterolemic subjects for the FHHelsinki gene in Finland. The propositi and their relatives were invited by a letter in which the purpose of the
study was stated. A total of 65 of the 69 invited
individuals visited the outpatient clinic, where fasting
blood samples were drawn and a physical examination
was performed. The clinical diagnoses were set by one
of the investigators following a protocol designed for
this study, while the FH diagnosis by DNA analysis was
accomplished by another investigator. The two judgments were kept blinded to each other until the whole
study had been completed. The study protocol was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the hospital.
Physical Examination
The patients were asked about previous cholesterol
measurements, medications, and illnesses, with a particular attention to findings and symptoms suggestive of
CHD. They were classified as having CHD if a previous
diagnosis of myocardial infarction or angina pectoris
had been established or if they had had exercise electrocardiographic findings compatible with those of
CHD.
During physical examination the presence of tendon
and subperiosteal xanthomas, corneal arcus, and xanthelasmas was registered. For xanthomas, a three-stage
classification was used as follows: 1) no xanthomas, 2)
suspected xanthomas (slight irregularity in a tendon or

olecranon or a slightly predominant tibial tuberosity),
or 3) unequivocal xanthomas. The latero-lateral thickness (in millimeters) of the Achilles tendons was measured using a ruler, by taking the tendon between the
thumb and index finger and applying slight pressure,
with the patient relaxed in bed with the ankle flexed at
90°.
Laboratory Methods
Serum cholesterol17 and triglyceride18 concentrations
were measured by enzymatic methods using commercial
kits obtained from Boehringer (Mannheim, FRG). The
concentration of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was measured enzymatically after precipitation
of LDL and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)
fractions with dextran sulfate and magnesium chloride.19 The concentration of LDL cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald formula.20
To exclude causes of secondary hypercholesterolemia, serum aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, thyroid stimulating hormone, fasting blood glucose, and urine protein were determined
using standard techniques of the clinical laboratory.
Findings in these tests were normal with the exception
of a slightly elevated aspartate aminotransferase activity
in one case and an elevated fasting blood glucose (8.1
mmol/l) in another. Both of these patients were middleaged obese non-FH men. In addition, one male FH
patient had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Clinical Diagnosis of Familial Hypercholesterolemia
Most young FH patients do not have xanthomas.3 The
concentration of LDL cholesterol in serum is a better
discriminator between FH and non-FH patients than is
total cholesterol.21 Therefore, serum LDL cholesterol
concentration was chosen as the main criterion. Serum
cholesterol levels show day-to-day variation,22 and serum LDL cholesterol levels of FH and non-FH patients
overlap.3'21 Therefore, a three-stage classification (not
FH, possible FH, and FH) was used.
The LDL cholesterol limits for these categories were
derived from the Policy Statement of the European
Atherosclerosis Society.2 According to this statement,
LDL cholesterol levels >4.9 mmol/l (or total cholesterol
>7.8 mmol/l) are compatible with adult FH, although
adult FH patients usually have total cholesterol levels
>9 mmol/l. Accordingly, for the present study the LDL
cholesterol limits were chosen as follows: 1) <5.0
mmol/l for "not FH," 2) 5.0-5.9 mmol/l for "possible
FH," and 3) ^6.0 mmol/l for "FH." If a patient with a
serum LDL cholesterol level in the "possible FH" range
had unequivocal xanthomas, he or she was diagnosed as
having FH. According to the policy statement, in children and adolescents serum total cholesterol levels >6.7
mmol/l are compatible with FH. 2 Therefore, the LDL
cholesterol limits for the diagnostic categories in children (<18 years) were set 1 mmol/l lower than those for
the adults. Patients taking hypolipidemic drugs were
judged to have FH if they were documented to have a
pretreatment serum total cholesterol concentration ^ 9
mmol/l.2 This criterion was used in 15 cases. One
patient, the sister of a propositus, with a serum LDL
cholesterol concentration of 4.8 mmol/l was considered
to have FH despite the protocol outlined above because

1) she had metastasized carcinoma of the breast, 2) she
reported an earlier serum cholesterol level of 9.5
mmol/1, and 3) her son had clinically evident FH with
xanthomatosis.
The present criteria for the diagnosis of FH are more
conservative than those presented in the policy statement, according to which all serum LDL levels compatible with FH (>4.9 mmol/1 in adults) together with the
presence of xanthomas in a relative (which was true for
all the patients of the present series) provide a definite
diagnosis of FH. Our decision to include adult patients
with serum LDL cholesterol levels in the range of
5.0-5.9 mmol/1 in the FH group only if xanthomas were
present was based on the fact that serum cholesterol
concentration levels are higher in the Finnish population than in most other Western populations.23-24
DNA Analysis
Leukocytic DNA was extracted from 10 ml EDTAanticoagulated whole blood. The assay for the FHHelsinki mutation, which is caused by a 9.5-kb deletion
at the 3' end of the LDL receptor gene, was performed
as previously described.15-25 In brief, DNA was digested
with BamHl, fractionated by agar gel electrophoresis,
transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and hybridized by
using a cDNA probe specific to exons 11—17 of the LDL
receptor gene. This probe was prepared by BamHl-Xho
I digestion of pLDLR3 (a gift from Drs. D.W. Russell,
M.S. Brown, and J.L. Goldstein, Dallas, Tex.), which
contains 971 nucleotides. The presence of the FHHelsinki mutation is characterized by the appearance of
an extra 8-kb BamHl restriction fragment in addition to
the normal 17-kb BamHl restriction fragment.15
For the determination of the Xba I polymorphism of
apolipoprotein B, DNA samples were analyzed essentially as described above with the exception that the
enzyme Xba I was used to digest the samples and that
the apolipoprotein B cDNA probe pB23 (donated by
Dr. Jan L. Breslow, New York) was used in the hybridization analysis.8 The allele resulting in the formation of
an 8.6-kb Xba I fragment is designated as XI and that
generating a 5-kb fragment as X2.
The common apolipoprotein E alleles e2, e3, and e4
were determined by direct DNA analysis.26 In this
method, the target DNA is amplified by the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and subsequently analyzed by
digestion with the restriction enzyme Hha I, followed by
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the cleavage
products.26
Statistical Methods
Statistical calculations were carried out using BMDP
statistical software program 7D to explore statistical
significances of differences between groups and program 6D to compute linear correlations (BMDP Statistical Software, Inc., Los Angeles). All the data are given
as mean±SEM.

diagnosis of FH was set in 28 cases, six were in the
"possible FH" category, and 31 subjects were considered not to have FH (Figure 1).
DNA analysis showed that 25 of the 28 subjects with
the clinical diagnosis of FH had inherited the FHHelsinki mutation (or the "M family" mutation; see
below) of the LDL receptor gene (Figure 1). The three
subjects who were misclassified as FH patients on
clinical grounds were adult persons. In two of them,
LDL cholesterol levels (6.1 and 6.2 mmol/1) were only
slightly above the classification limit (6 mmol/1),
whereas the third, a woman in her 60s, had an LDL
cholesterol level of 6.8 mmol/1.
Four of the six subjects in the "possible FH" category
proved to have inherited the FH-Helsinki or the M
family mutation (Figure 1). Only one patient with a
DNA diagnosis of FH was classified in the clinical "not
FH" category. This 12-year-old boy, belonging to the M
family (see below), had a serum LDL cholesterol concentration of 3.0 mmol/1.
Characteristics of the Low Density Lipoprotein
Receptor Gene Mutation in the M Family
In one of the 10 families (the M family), the LDL
receptor gene mutation turned out to be different from
the true FH-Helsinki mutation, although the propositus
of this family (a 65-year-old woman) had earlier been
tentatively classified as a carrier of the FH-Helsinki
gene. In the FH members of this family, the extra
BamHl fragment hybridizable with the LDL receptor
cDNA probe was slightly larger (11 kb) than that (8 kb)
in families with the FH-Helsinki mutation (Figure 2).
The boundaries of this 11-kb fragment were judged to
be determined by the BamHl restriction sites in intron
10 and exon 18 (Figure 2). Digestion of the DNA
samples with Kpnl resulted, in addition to the formation
of three invariant bands (about 23,15, and 9 kb in size)
both in the member of the M family and the control
subjects, in the appearance of a faint band with a
molecular size of about 3 kb (Figure 2). The generation
of this fragment is apparently determined by the Kpnl
sites in introns 14 and 16 (Figure 2). The extra 10-kb
Pvu II fragment is explainable by the narrowing of the
distance between the Pvu II sites in introns 10 and 16 in
the M mutation (Figure 2). The 5'- end and the 3'-end
boundaries of the extra 18-kb EcoRV fragment in the
mutant DNA are determined by the EcoTLV restriction
sites in exon 13 and at the 3'-flanking area of the LDL

5-kb Xba I fragment is likely to result from a closer
distance between the Xba I sites in intron 12 and intron
16 in the mutant gene (Figure 2). Collectively, these data
indicate that the M family mutation is most likely a
deletion of about 6 kb, extending from intron 14 to intron
15 and thus deleting the entire exon 15 (Figure 2).

the range of the other FH patients (Figure 3). Therefore, in subsequent analyses of lipoprotein levels in FH
and non-FH subjects, data from the M family were
combined with those of the other families.
All but two of the DNA-verified FH patients who
were more than 40 years of age were taking hypolipidemic medication during the course of the present
study. These two patients, including a 68-year-old
woman with a metastasized carcinoma of the breast and
a 44-year-old man with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and a strict low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet, had
serum LDL cholesterol levels below the FH range
(Figure 3). In untreated adult DNA-verified FH patients, serum total cholesterol concentrations ranged
from 6.8 to 9.7 mmol/l, and in children and adolescents
the corresponding values amounted to 4.7-7.3 mmol/l.
The mean serum total cholesterol concentration of the
untreated FH patients was 7.5±0.4 mmol/l, and that of

tients; Table 1). In contrast, serum triglyceride levels
were higher in adult subjects; this difference reached
statistical significance in the FH group (Table 1).
Factors Influencing Serum Low Density Lipoprotein
Cholesterol Levels in Patients Not Taking
Hypolipidemic Drugs
The mean serum LDL cholesterol level of the FH
patients with an established DNA diagnosis who were
not taking hypolipidemic drugs was 2.5 mmol/1 higher
than that of the non-FH patients (Table 2). Children
and adolescents had a serum LDL cholesterol level
approximately 1.4-1.7 mmol/1 lower than that of the
adults. In this study gender did not significantly affect
serum LDL cholesterol levels.
There was a positive correlation between serum LDL
cholesterol concentration and age in the non-FH group
in particular (r=0.650, p<0.001; Figure 3). Serum LDL
cholesterol levels were also closely correlated with the
body mass index in the non-FH subjects (r=0.596,
p<0.001), in the untreated FH patients (r=0.679,
p<0.005), and in both groups combined (r=0.414,
p<0.01). When the patients were divided into two
groups according to their body mass index, the more
obese group had a higher mean serum LDL cholesterol
level (Table 2).
The apolipoprotein E allele frequencies in the total
cohort examined were as follows: e2, 0.10; e3, 0.65; and
et, 0.25. The frequency of the e4 allele was higher in FH
patients (0.33) than in their unaffected relatives (0.17;
p<0.05). The presence of the e4 allele was not associated with significant variations of serum LDL choles-

terol level in the total number of untreated subjects or
either of its subgroups, i.e., subjects with or without FH
(Table 2). The frequency of the XI allele of the apolipoprotein B gene was 0.73 and that of the X2 allele was
0.27 in the total cohort examined. There were no
significant differences in the apolipoprotein B allele
frequencies of subjects with and without FH. The
presence of the X2 allele was associated with a higher
mean serum LDL cholesterol concentration than its
absence in the non-FH subjects; this association was not
found in FH patients (Table 2).
All of the three adult non-FH subjects who were
misclassified as FH patients on clinical grounds had the
X1X2 genotype of apolipoprotein B. One of them
possessed the (414 genotype, whereas the others had the
genotypes e3/2 and e3/3 of apolipoprotein E. The corresponding apolipoprotein B and E genotypes of the
FH child clinically misclassified as a non-FH subject
were X1X2 and e4/3, respectively.
Serum Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol
Concentrations in Familial Hypercholesterolemia
Patients Taking Hypolipidemic Drugs
The mean serum LDL cholesterol concentration in
the 15 adult FH patients taking hypolipidemic drugs was
4.98±0.28 mmol/1. All of them reported consumption of
a hypolipidemic diet. In this group the mean serum
LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or triglyceride concentrations did not show significant variation according
to the apolipoprotein E or B genotypes (data not
shown), but female patients had a higher mean serum

ness was ^20 mm in 76% of the adult FH patients but
in only 7% of their non-FH relatives. The combination
of an unequivocal xanthomatosis and/or a thick (^20
mm) Achilles tendon provided an even better discrimination between FH patients and non-FH subjects (Table 3).
In comparison with tendon xanthomas and subperiosteal xanthomatosis, lid xanthelasmas (32%) and lipoid
arcus (16%) were seen less frequently in the adult FH
patients (Figure 4). None of the FH patients or their
relatives below 45 years of age had symptomatic CHD.
In contrast, all four male and four of seven female FH
patients of at least 45 years of age had a history of
symptomatic CHD (Figure 4).
Discussion
The enrichment of a specific LDL receptor gene
mutation in the Finnish population facilitates an unequivocal discrimination between FH and non-FH
members of families with a known carrier status of this
mutant gene. This prompted us to clarify how accurate
the routine clinical criteria — family and patient history,
serum LDL cholesterol concentration, and the presence
of tendon xanthomas — are in the diagnosis of heterozygous FH. The availability of a confirmatory diagnostic
technique also permits studies in which the effects of
age, gender, and drug and dietary interventions, as well
as the genetic variation of other DNA loci on the
phenotypic features of FH, can be investigated.

Using somewhat modified criteria of an authoritative
recommendation,2 we achieved a correct clinical diagnosis of FH in 55 (85%) of the 65 subjects examined.
Four subjects were placed in an incorrect diagnostic
category, and six subjects were assigned to the "possible
FH" group. In the age group <18 years, only two of the
five FH children were correctly diagnosed clinically
because the serum LDL levels in the remaining three
patients were lower than the diagnostic limits adopted.
In this age group tendon xanthomas are a rarity and,
therefore, virtually never assist in the diagnosis. All
these data emphasize the usefulness of DNA methods
as an adjunct in the diagnosis of heterozygous FH.
When FH is suspected on clinical presentation, the
age of the patient should be carefully taken into account. If the Finnish age- and sex-specific 95th percentile LDL cholesterol concentration curves (Reference
27 and A. Reunanen, unpublished) were depicted in
Figure 3, the serum LDL cholesterol concentrations of
the present non-FH subjects would not exceed this 95th
percentile level. The corresponding value would be
below the age- and sex-specific 95th percentile level in
only four FH patients, including two children and a
44-year-old man with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and a strict low-fat diet, as well as the patient with
metastasized carcinoma of the breast who was discussed
earlier. In fact, the introduction of the age- and sexspecific 95th percentile LDL cholesterol values instead
of the rigid ones originally employed would have permitted a correct diagnosis (FH versus non-FH) in 95%
of the subjects of the present study.
During the initial screening, all propositi of the
present study were judged to be carriers of the FHHelsinki mutation of the LDL receptor gene. This
mutation, unique to the Finnish population, is an =9.5kb-long deletion of the LDL receptor gene that eliminates exons 16 and 17 and part of exon 18, resulting in
a truncated LDL receptor protein and leading to a
defective internalization of LDL particles.15 During the
progress of the present study, one of the probands and
six of her affected relatives belonging to the M family
were demonstrated to have an LDL receptor gene
deletion reminiscent of but yet different from the FHHelsinki mutation. Further studies revealed that this
mutation is due to an =«6-kb deletion extending from
intron 14 to intron 15 (Figure 2). The determination of
the exact boundaries of this deletion was, however, not
possible on the basis of the current data. We have
designated this mutation FH-Espoo according to the
residence of the M family. Although the mean serum
LDL cholesterol levels in the FH-Espoo family were not
different from those in other famines, a 12-year-old boy
with FH-Espoo and his affected cousin had relatively
low serum LDL cholesterol levels (3.0 and 4.0 mmol/1,
respectively; Figure 3). The possibility that the low LDL
cholesterol levels in the two young cousins could be due
to a "cholesterol lowering gene" 9 is made less likely by
the fact that their fathers were carriers of the M family
mutation and had high serum LDL cholesterol levels. In
the families with the FH-Helsinki mutation, a total of 23
subjects were identified as carriers of the mutant gene
by DNA analysis. None of them was clinically classified
in the non-FH category, and only four of them, each
from separate families, were classified as "possible FH"
patients. Collectively, we were unable to find evidence

for the occurrence of a putative cholesterol-lowering
gene in the families examined by us.
Polymorphisms of the genes encoding the ligands for
the LDL receptor, apolipoproteins E and B, have been
shown to affect serum total and LDL cholesterol levels
in FH patients in some but not in all studies.7-8^28-30 In
the present study in which only a relatively small group
of untreated patients was available, these polymorphisms did not significantly affect serum LDL cholesterol levels in FH patients. Of the non-FH relatives,
carriers of the apolipoprotein X2 allele had a higher
mean serum LDL cholesterol level than did those
without this allele, which is in accordance with our
earlier findings in a random Finnish population sample.31 The overrepresentation of apolipoprotein E allele
e4 in our FH patients compared with unaffected relatives is very likely a chance association because the
genes for the LDL receptor and apolipoprotein E have
been localized on opposite ends of chromosome 1932
and therefore should not be linked. No association
between FH and any apolipoprotein E phenotype has
been noted in other studies.28-29
The present study, in which the ultimate diagnosis of
FH was based on DNA analysis and thus is unequivocal,
confirms the findings of earlier studies of the prevalence
of some physical findings in heterozygous FH patients.
Tendon xanthomatosis was encountered in 68% of the
adult FH patients, which compares well with earlier
estimates.3-33"35 The simple measurement of the Achilles tendon thickness (^20 mm) identified three quarters
of the adult FH patients. This percentage is almost as
high as that achieved by measuring Achilles tendon
thickness radiologicalry.34 Our simple method is, however, less precise than the radiological methods, and an
excess of subcutaneous fat may cause falsely elevated
values. In fact, in the present series the two non-FH
subjects with abnormally thick Achilles tendons were
both obese.
In conclusion, our study shows that more than 10% of
adult members belonging to FH families may be incorrectly classified as FH or non-FH subjects when simple
clinical criteria like those in the present study are used.
However, when age-, population-, and sex-specific 95th
percentile values for serum LDL cholesterol are used
instead of common reference limits for all adults, only
one of 20 subjects is incorrectly classified as to the FH
status. In doubtful cases and in particular in the evaluation of children, detection or exclusion of an LDL
receptor gene mutation is a very useful adjunct to
confirm or refute the diagnosis. The applicability of
DNA diagnostics is especially conspicuous in populations with an enrichment of specific LDL receptor
mutation(s) until convenient simultaneous screening
techniques for multiple mutations of a specific gene
become available.
