Abstract
The constant dÃ©naturantgel electrophoresis technique was used to
screen for TP53 germ line mutations in 237 women with breast carcinoma
(167 unselected patients, 30 patients with at least one first-degree relative
with breast cancer, and 40 women diagnosed with breast cancer before
age 35). A germ line mutation at codon 181 was noted in one of the
unselected patients and a codon 245 mutation in one of the early-onset
patients. Both had a family history of breast cancer and other malignan
cies suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The codon 245 mutation was
also present in this patient's affected mother.

Introduction
Breast carcinomas account for approximately 20% of cancerrelated deaths in women. In Norway, Iceland, and the United
States, the incidence of breast cancer ranges from 90 to 110
cases/100,000 women/year, and deaths from breast cancer in
these three populations approximate 45,000 annually (1-3).
Although most cases are sporadic, a frequent familial aggrega
tion of breast cancer indicates that it will be of critical impor
tance to understand the genetic elements of susceptibility. Be
tween 5 and 10% of all cases are estimated to be hereditary,
with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance (4). Approx
imately 20% of women with breast cancer are estimated to have
one or more first-degree relatives with the disease (5). Both
epidemiolÃ³gica! studies and linkage analysis suggest heteroge
neity with respect to the genetic basis of breast cancer (6). In
some families, breast cancer is associated with the occurrence
of ovarian, uterine, or colorectal cancer (7). Survivors of child
hood soft tissue sarcoma and their relatives have also been
observed to be at increased risk for developing breast and
adrenocortical carcinomas, sarcomas, leukemias, and brain tu
mors (Li-Fraumeni syndrome) (8).
Recently, two specific genetic factors thought to be important
for breast cancer susceptibility have been identified. A region
on the long arm of chromosome 17 has been shown to be closely
linked to breast cancer susceptibility in many families with early
onset site specific breast cancer, and in families with breast and
ovarian cancer (6). The gene defect in breast cancer patients
who have the Li-Fraumeni syndrome often appears to be germ
line mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 on chromo
some arm 17p (9, 10). The frequencies of germ line TP53
mutations among patients with various cancers whose family
histories are not consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome have

not yet been fully defined. We have recently developed a rapid
screening technique for detection of TP53 mutations (11), using
CDGE (12),' which is a modification of the denaturing gradient
gel electrophoresis system (13). In this technique altered DNA
fragments migrate with a constantly different rate through the
gel, allowing separation of several centimeters between mutants
and wild-type DNA. In the present study, the CDGE technique
has been used to explore the occurrence of germ line TP53
mutations in exons 5 through 8, in which the conserved regions
are located, and where more than 95% of the mutations in
sporadic tumors have been located (14). Specifically, we have
studied 167 unselected breast cancer patients, 30 breast cancer
patients with positive family history, and 40 patients who
developed breast cancer before age 35.
Materials

and Methods

Patients. The unselected breast cancer patients consisted of a consec
utive series of 65 breast cancer patients with mean age 56.8 years
(ranging from 31 to 80) admitted to The Norwegian Radium Hospital,
and a consecutive series of 102 Icelandic patients with mean age 58.6
(ranging from 33 to 94) admitted to the three main Reykjavik hospitals.
All cases were checked for family history of breast cancer in collabo
ration with the Norwegian and Icelandic Cancer Registries. Fourteen
of the Norwegian and 12 of the Icelandic patients had at least one firstdegree relative with the disease. The selected series of 30 patients with
familial aggregation of breast cancer (at least one first-degree relative
with breast cancer) consisted of patients admitted to the Norwegian
Radium Hospital and patients from the Oslo area asking for genetic
counseling because of a familial aggregation of breast cancer. The
patients in this series were interviewed with respect to family history
by standardized questionnaires, and all cancer diagnoses reponed were
confirmed by the Norwegian Cancer Registry.
The series of 40 breast cancer patients diagnosed before the age of
35 consisted of 38 patients identified through the Breast Evaluation
Center at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, the Joint Center for
Radiation Therapy at the Harvard Medical School, the Toronto-Bayview Regional Cancer Center in Toronto, and from calls from interested
patients and physicians regarding genetic testing. The other two pa
tients under the age of 35 were identified at the Georgetown Medical
School. Breast cancer diagnoses were confirmed by using medical
records, and family history information was recorded but not routinely
confirmed. Ten to 20 ml of blood were drawn from each patient into
EDTA-containing test tubes and stored at â€”¿40"C
until DNA analysis.
TP53 Mutation Analysis with the Use of CDGE. DNA was extracted
from whole blood, using standard procedures (phenol/chloroform and
ethanol precipitation). The PCR was performed by using four sets of
primers, covering 80% of the conserved region of the TP53 gene (codons
128-153 and 155-185 of exon 5, codons 237-253 of exon 7, and codons
265-301 of exon 8) as previously described, using 100-300 ng of
template DNA (II). CDGE and perpendicular denaturing gradient gels
were performed by using 12.5% acrylamide in 0.04 M Tris-acÃ©tate,
0.001 M EDTA (pH 8.0), and varying dÃ©naturant concentrations
consisting of urea and formamide (100% dÃ©naturantcorresponds to 7

M urea and 40% formamide) as previously described (11, 12). In
perpendicular gels a dÃ©naturantgradient was used perpendicular to the
electrophoretic direction. In CDGE a uniform denaturing concentration
through the gel was used. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained
for 2 min in ethidium bromide, 2 mg ethidium bromide/liter and 0.04
M tris-acÃ©tate,0.001 M EDTA (pH 8.0), and photographed by using a
UV transilluminator.
Sequencing. Samples that had aberrantly migrating bands in the
CDGE were all submitted to PCR for direct sequencing. PCR was
performed with one biotinylated primer. The biotinylated PCR products
were sequenced directly with standard dideoxy sequencing reactions,
using Dynabeads M280-Streptavidin (Dynal AS, Norway) as solid
support, or using a sequencing kit (Stratagene).

Analysis of the constitutional DNAs from the 167 unselected
patients yielded an aberrantly migrating band in fragment B
(codon 155-185) in one sample (Patient 101). This indicated
the presence of a germ line mutation in this region of the gene
of this patient. A tumor sample from the patient was analyzed
by using both CDGE and perpendicular gels (Fig. 1). In the
tumor, the wild-type fragment that accompanied the mutated
fragment was present in reduced concentration, indicating loss
of the normal alÃ-ele.Sequencing was performed to determine
the exact nature of the mutation. A mutation at codon 181
(CGC â€”¿Â»
CAC / Arg â€”¿Â»
His) was detected. This confirmed the
CDGE results. Review of this patient's family history revealed
six cases of breast cancer, one leiomyosarcoma at age 49, and
other neoplasms (Fig. 2A). The presence of sarcoma and breast
cancer in this kindred is suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome,
with the exception of the late onset of the sarcoma.
An aberrantly migrating band in fragment C was found in 1
of the 40 patients with early onset of disease (Patient 144; Fig.
3, Lane 3). The mutation was confirmed in a perpendicular gel
and by sequencing, and was located at codon 245 (GGC â€”¿Â»
AGC / Gly â€”¿Â»
Ser). The patient had a positive maternal family
history of four premenopausal breast cancers, abdominal cancer
at age 16, and early-onset lung cancer (Fig. 2B). The identical
germ line mutation at codon 245 was identified in the mother,
who was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 47 (Fig. 3, Lane
2). No germ line carriers were found in the selected group of
30 Norwegian patients with a positive family history.
In order to verify that the CDGE technique was able to detect
mutations in exons 5 through 8, we sequenced all of the 40

ments in rapid screening techniques, offers an alternative
method for surveying such populations.
Our findings indicate that germ line TP53 mutations occur
in extremely few breast cancer patients who do not have family
histories suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

Discussion
77*55 gene mutations currently represent the most common
genetic alteration detected in human malignancies (14). TP53
appears to be a tumor suppressor gene, encoding a nuclear
phosphoprotein that normally negatively regulates cell growth
and differentiation (15).
Recently, it has been shown that germ line TP53 mutations
are present in affected members of some Li-Fraumeni syndrome
families. In the first five families investigated, the affected
family members all carried an altered TP53 gene (9). The
finding of germ line TP53 mutations in Li-Fraumeni syndrome
families has been confirmed by several groups (10, 16, 17).
Since then, we have found some Li-Fraumeni families who do
not have TP53 mutations in exons 5-8.4
Little is known about the frequency of TP53 germ line
mutations in breast cancer patients outside families with the
classical Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Prosser et al. (18) screened
five families with early onset breast cancer for constitutional
mutations in all 11 exons of the TP53 gene, using the hydroxylamine mismatch base pair technique, without finding muta
tions. We have detected two TP53 germ line carriers, 1 among
167 unselected breast cancer patients, and 1 among 40 earlyonset breast cancer patients (approximately 1%). This fre
quency is lower than the 4 carriers detected among 196 sarcoma
patients (2%) (19) and the 4 detected among 59 patients with
second malignancies (7%) (20). These studies analyzed exons 5
through 8 of the TP53 gene. We restricted our study to the
same parts of the gene. Germ line TP53 mutations may, how
ever occur outside this region, and CDGE is well suited for
eventually extending these studies.
The first study describing germ line mutations in Li-Frau
meni syndrome reported mutations in exon 7 only, clustering
from codon 245 to 258 (9). Recently, a mutation in exon 5 (at
codon 133) have been identified as well (16). In another recent
report, where exon 7 was investigated, 2 of 8 Li-Fraumeni
syndrome families showed germ line mutations (17). The mu
tations found in patients with sarcomas and patients with
second malignancies were found in several exons (19, 20).
The two germ line mutations detected in the present material
were both missense mutations. They were found in exons 5 and
7, respectively. Since the codon 181 (Arg â€”¿>
His) mutation has
not been noted previously in families with Li-Fraumeni syn
drome or any sporadic tumors, we have tested whether this
mutation inactivates TP53 function and whether it is associated
with cancer risk. Preliminary studies suggest that this codon
181 mutation may be functionally silent and may not impart
any increased cancer risk (21). In contrast, mutation at codon
245 is found in a highly conserved domain and has been noted
in families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and in sporadic tumors
(9, 14). The codon 245 mutation, like the classic Li-Fraumeni
syndrome TP53 mutations, appears to be associated with cancer
risk.
Surveying large populations to determine the frequency of
germ line TP53 mutations is prohibitively expensive when the
frequency is less than 1%. CDGE, or similar further improve4 S. H. Friend, personal communication.
