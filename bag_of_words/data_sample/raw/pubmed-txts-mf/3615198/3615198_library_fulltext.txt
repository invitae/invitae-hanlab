ABSTRACT

Classical Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive human
genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine
hydroxylase (PAH). We isolated several mutant PAH cDNA clones from a PKU
carrier individual and showed that they contained an internal 116 base pair
deletion, corresponding precisely to exon 12 of the human chromosomal PAH
gene. The deletion causes the synthesis of a truncated protein lacking the
C-terminal 52 amino acids. Gene transfer and expression studies using the
mutant PAH cDNA indicated that the deletion abolishes PAH activity in the
cell as a result of protein instability. To determine the molecular basis
of the deletion, the mutant chromosomal PAH gene was isolated from this
individual and shown to contain a GT-->AT substitution at the 5' splice
donor site of intron 12. Thus, the consequence of the splice donor site
mutation in the human liver is the skipping of the preceding exon during
RNA splicing.
INTRODUCTION

Classical Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive human genetic
disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH,
phenylalanine 4--monooxygenase, EC 1.14.16.1). In the normal human liver, PAH
catalyzes the hydroxylation of phenylalanine to tyrosine. Absence of PAH
activity causes an accumulation of serum phenylalanine, resulting in
hyperphenylalaninemia and a depletion of its normal catabolites. Without
detection at birth followed by rigid implementation of a restricted synthetic
diet low in phenylalanine, the abnormalities associated with phenylalanine
metabolism in PKU patients will cause postnatal brain damage and severe mental
retardation. PKU is the most common inborn error in amino acid metabolism.
Its incidence among Caucasians is about 1:10,000, and the mutant gene
frequency predicts that I in 50 individuals is a carrier of the disease trait
(for reviews, see ref. 1,2).
To understand the molecular basis of PKU, we previously isolated PAH cDNA
clones from two independent human liver cDNA libraries (3, 4). The original

liver cDNA library was constructed in pBR322 (5) and provided several
partial-length PAH cDNA clones (3) representing the 3'-half of PAH mRNA. The
second cDNA library was constructed in Xgtll from a different liver source,
from which a full-length 2.4 kb PAH cDNA (phPAH247) was obtained (4). Clone
phPAH247 has been sequenced (4) and shown to code for enzymatically active PAH
upon transfection into manmalian cells (6).
When we characterized the
partial-length human PAH cDNA clones from the original library by restriction
mapping and sequence analysis, normal and mutant clones were identified. The
normal cDNA was comparable to hPAH247 and contained a 588 bp HindIll fragment
in the peptide coding region, while the mutant cDNA contained an internal 472
bp HindIII fragment instead. In this paper we report that this fragment size
difference in the mutant cDNA resulted from a deletion of the entire exon 12
sequence (coding for amino acids #401-438 of PAH) during mRNA processing.
This deletion results in a frameshift mutation that abolishes PAH stability
and enzymatic activity. The presence of normal and mutant PAH mRNAs in the
liver of the "apparently normal" individual used in this study demonstrated
that this individual was a PKU carrier.
The molecular cloning and
characterization of the corresponding mutant chromosomal PAH gene demonstrated
a GT-->AT transition at the 5'-donor splice site of intron 12, which is
identical to the one we recently reported for the most prevalent PKU allele
among Caucasians of Northern European decent (7). The cloning of a mutant PAH
cDNA from a PKU carrier in this report enabled us to show that the intron 12
splice donor site mutation in PKU results in skipping of exon 12 during mRNA
processing in vivo.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Enzymes and Reapents
Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New
England Biolabs. Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) was
purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. T4 polynucleotide kinase and the M13
cloning/sequencing kit was obtained from PL Biochemicals.
[1- S]dATP
(65OCi/mmol) for sequencing and [ C] phenylalanine (600 Ci/mmol) for PAH
activity assays were purchased from Amersham Corporation, and 1Y P]ATP
(7000 Ci/mmol, crude fraction) was purchased from ICN.
Isolation and Characterization of Human PAH cDNA Clones
We previously constructed a human liver cDNA library (comprised of 40,000
independent transformants) cloned into the PstI site of pBR322 by the dG-dC
tailing method (5). The human cDNA library was screened using a previously

Nucleic Acids Research
cloned rat PAH cDNA (9) and a total of eight PAH cDNA clones were isolated
from this library (3). Restriction enzyme mapping of the cDNA clones and
selected DNA fragments reported in this paper was carried out as described by
Kwok et al (4).
DNA Sequence Analysis
The internal 588 bp Hindill fragment isolated from PAH cDNAs were
into
and
inserted
M13mpl8(10),
sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide
chain-termination method (11). The entire sequence of the HindIII fragment
was determined by using M13 clones containing inserts in both orientations.
The remaining sequence of the PAH cDNA was determined by the chemical
modification method of Maxam and Gilbert (12) using the sequencing strategy
previously reported for hPAH247 (4). The plasmids were digested with the

appropriate restriction endonuclease and either 5' end labelled with
polynucleotide kinase and [Y-3 P]ATP or 3' end labelled with DNA
polymerase I (Klenow fragment) and [v- P]dNTP. After digestion with a
second restriction enzyme, single end labelled fragments were isolated from 5%
polyacrylamide gels for DNA sequence analysis.
Plasmid Constructions
Standard cloning techniques were used for plasmid constructions.
Eukaryotic expression vector p91023(B) (13) was linearized with EcoRI and
treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (2.5 units/50 pmol of 5'
termini). This vector contains the SV40 origin of replication, which enables
propogation of recombinant clones in monkey kidney (COS) cells (14). To
construct the normal PAH cDNA expression clone, phPAH247 was restricted with
EcoRI and the full-length cDNA insert was isolated by preparative low melting
temperature agarose gel electrophoresis (International Biotechnologies,
Inc.). PAH cDNA insert (lOng) was ligated to p91023(B) (9Ong) in a 20 41
reaction at 8 C overnight. Ligated DNA was used to transform E. coli HB101,
and bacterial transformants were selected for resistance to tetracycline (7.5
DNA was isolated from transformants by the
pg/ml of growth medium).
alkaline lysis procedure (15) and the orientation of PAH cDNA insert in the
p91023(B) vector was determined by restriction enzyme mapping (4).
To construct the full-length mutant PAH cDNA expression clone, the 588 bp
internal HindlII fragment of hPAH247 was replaced by the corresponding HindlII
fragment (containing the 116 bp deletion) from the partial-length mutant PAH
cDNA (Fig. 3A). The orientation of the mutant HindIII fragment within the
cDNA was then determined by restriction endonuclease mapping (4).
The
resulting full-length mutant PAH cDNA fragment was ligated into the EcoRI site
of p91023(B) as described above for the normal PAH cDNA.

Gene Transfer Experiments
Normal and mutant PAHcDNA/p91023B constructs were used to transfect COS
cells in suspension by the Chu and Sharp method (16).
Briefly, cells
were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with

10% bovine calf serum. Cells from three 15 cm plates (about 10 cells) were
transfected in 2 ml of DNA-calcium phosphate cocktail (16) (containing 50 pg
of recombinant plasmid) for 15 minutes at room temperature in a 50 ml
polypropylene tube, followed by the addition of 40 ml of DMEM supplemented
with 6.25 mM CaCl . Ten ml aliquots of the suspended cells were then plated

shocked in 25% glycerol, and then incubated in growth medium for approximately
36 hours.
PAH mRNA and Protein Analysis
Transfected cells from three 15 cm plates were harvested by scraping in
30 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), centrifuged, and resuspended in 400
4l of PBS. PAH activity assays and Western blot analysis were carried out
on cell extracts as previously described (6). RNA was isolated from cells

from one 15-cm plate by phenol extraction and spotted directly on
nitrocellulose using a slot blot manifold (Schleicher and Schuell). The
filter was hybridized to labelled hPAH247.
Genomic DNA Cloning
Frozen liver tissue (0.5g) was ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen
using a mortar and pestle. After the liquid nitrogen evaporated, lOml of
lysis buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 1.0 mM EDTA, 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 100 Pg/ml
proteinase K, and 0.5% SDS) was immediately added, and DNA was isolated as
described (17). Genomic DNA (100 pg) was digested to completion with EcoRI
and size fractionated on a 1.25-5 H NaCl gradient (17).
Lambda (X)
bacteriophage CH4A cloning arms were prepared by ligation of the cohesive
termini and digestion with EcoRI as described (18). Contaminating stuffer
fragments (6.6 kb and 7.8 kb) were removed from the cloning arms (31 kb) by
NaCl gradient centrifugation.
Size-fractionated genomic DNA (0.45 jg; 10-20
kb) was ligated to XCH4A arms (1.3 pg) in a 16 4I reaction at 12 C
overnight.
The resulting concatenated DNA molecules were packaged with
extracts prepared by the procedure of Grosveld et al. (19), and the infectious
bacteriophage particles were used to transduce E. coli LE392. The genomic
library was screened by the amplification method of Woo (20) using hPAH247 as
the hybridization probe.

Oligonucleotide Hybridization Analysis of Genomic Clones
DNA was isolated from positive bacteriophage plaques as previously
described (4). EcoRI plus HindIII digests of the recombinant clones were
electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and
processed for direct-gel hybridization (21). The dried gel membranes were

hybridized overnight at 370C in 6 x NET (0.9 H NaCl, 6 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS,

buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Na-acetate [pH4.5], 2 mM zinc acetate [pH4.51)
containing 2,000 units of SI nuclease (Miles Laboratories, Inc.) was added to
the reaction, and the sample was incubated at 37 C for 2 hours.
The
reaction was then stopped by the addition of 14 4l of stop buffer (0.5 M
Tris-HCl, 0.25 M EDTA (pH7.5)), extracted once with an equal volume of
phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1) and then ethanol precipitated.
The Sl-nuclease resistant DNA-RNA hybrid was collected by centrifugation,
dried under vacuum, and dissolved in 10 p4 of loading buffer (50 mM NaOH,
1mM EDTA, 2.5% Ficoll, and 0.025% bromocresol green). The sizes of the
protected fragments were determined by alkaline-agarose gel electrophoresis
and autoradiography.
RESULTS

Identification of an Internally Deleted Human PAH cDNA Clone
We previously reported the isolation of several partial-length PAH cDNA
clones representing the 3' half of PAH mRNA from a human liver cDNA library
constructed in pBR322 (3).
Restriction endonuclease analysis of these
recombinants established the overlapping regions of the inserts and revealed
normal and mutant cDNA types (Fig. 1). The normal cDNA (lane 1) contained an
internal 588 bp HindIII fragment that was longer than the corresponding 472 bp

HindlII fragment from the mutant cDNA (lane 2). The internal HindIII fragment
purified from hPAH247 (4) (lane 3) comigrated with the corresponding HindlIl
fragment of the normal cDNA (lane 1), suggesting that the mutant cDNA
phenotype resulted from a deletion within the internal HindlII fragment. The
upper two bands in lanes 1 and 2 correspond to pBR322 and cDNA sequence
flanking the internal PAH HindIII fragment.
The precise location of the deletion in the mutant cDNA was defined by
sequence analysis. The nucleotide sequence of the internal HindIII fragment
derived from the normal cDNA was identical to that previously reported for
hPAH247, which corresponds to nucleotides 1309 to 1902 of the cDNA (4). The
sequence derived from the mutant HindIII fragment was identical to the normal
cDNA except for a 116 bp internal deletion of contiguous DNA spanning
nucleotides 1423 to 1538, which includes the 3'-coding sequence of PAH cDNA
(Fig. 1, open bracket). Interestingly, the 116 bp deleted region corresponded
precisely to exon 12 of the human chromosomal PAH gene (8). The nucleotide
sequences flanking the internal HindIII fragments of both normal and mutant
cDNA's were identical to the corresponding regions of hPAH247 (data not shown).
Exon 12 deletion abolishes PAH enzymatic activity and stability
Figure 2 shows the alignment of the nucleotide sequences of the normal
and mutant cDNA's in the immediate 5' and 3' regions flanking the deletion.
The deletion includes 114 bp encoding amino acids 401 to 438 of PAH and an AG
dinucleotide deletion in the Ser #439 codon, resulting in a frameshift
mutation that introduces a premature termination codon (UGA) following Arg 400
in the mutant cDNA.
Since this mutation would result in a PAH product
truncated by 52 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminus, we determined its effect
on PAH activity by gene transfer and transient expression experiments.

A full-length PAH cDNA bearing the deletion was constructed by replacing
the normal 588 bp Hindlll fragment of hPAH247 with the 472 bp HindlIl fragment
isolated from the mutant cDNA (Fig. 3A). The normal and internally deleted
recombinant cDNAs were then cloned into the EcoRI site of the eukaryotic
expression vector p91023(B) (13), downstream of the adenovirus major late
promoter (Ad MLP).
PAH activity assays measuring the conversion of

[ Cl-phenylalanine to 1 CI-tyrosine were performed using extracts from
cells transfected with the normal and mutant PAH cDNA constructs.
PAH
activity was present in extracts from control human liver (Fig. 3B, lane 1)
and in extracts from cells transfected with the normal PAH cDNA/p91023(B)
construct (Fig. 3B, lane 3).
However, PAH activity was not detected in
extracts from cells transfected with the mutant PAH cDNA/p91O23B construct

(Fig. 3B, lane 5),

in assays carried out in the absence of cofactor (Fig.
3B, lanes 2, 4 and 6). The complete absence of PAH activity is indicative of
the Classical PKU phenotype and can be attributed specifically to the deletion
of the exon 12 coding sequence in the mutant mRNA.
Western blot analysis using a PAH-specific antibody (6) demonstrated a
52-kd protein present in normal human liver extract (Fig. 3C, lane 1).
Extracts from transfected cells expressing normal PAH cDNA also contained
abundant levels of inmunoreactive PAH (Fig. 3C, lane 2) which was identical in
size to that present in the control liver. When the Western analysis was
carried out under conditions that could detect less than 1% of the normal PAH
levels (Fig. 3C, lane 5), no immunoreactive protein was detected in extracts
from cells transfected with the mutant PAH cDNA construct (Fig. 3C, lane 6).
Hybridization analysis of RNA isolated from transfected cells demonstrated
that both the normal (Fig. 3D, lanes 1-4) and mutant (Fig. 3D, lanes 5-8) cDNA
constructs expressed the respective mRNAs at comparable levels.
Characterization of the mutation causing exon 12 deletion
Nucleotides 1423 to 1538 deleted from the mutant PAH cDNA correspond to
exon 12 of the PAH gene (8).
Since sequences encoded by exons 11 and 13 were
present in the mutant clone, the molecular basis of this mutation could result
either from an exon 12 deletion in the mutant PAH allele or skipping of exon
12 during processing of the mutant PAH mRNA transcript. To distinguish these
possibilities, we constructed a genomic DNA library from the human liver
sample from which the mutant cDNA was obtained. We screened the library with
hPAH247 and isolated the corresponding genomic DNA clones. Since the mutant
cDNA deletion corresponded to exon 12, we focused our analysis on this region

DNA of this individual (data not shown).

The mutant PAH mRNA could then result from an error in RNA processing.
We recently reported a prevalent PKU mutation resulting from a single base
substitution (GT- ->AT) in the canonical 5'-donor splice site at the exon

12/intron 12 junction of the PAH gene (7). Since a similar substitution in
intron 2 of the human 1-globin gene results in the skipping of exon 2 from
the corresponding mRNA transcript (31), we speculated that the PKU splicing
mutation might cause the skipping of exon 12 in the mRNA. To test this
hypothesis, we used previously constructed oligonucleotide probes specific for
the normal and mutant sequences to detect the GT--->AT mutation of intron 12
(7).
Using the hybridization conditions previously reported (7, 21), the
normal oligonucleotide probe hybridized specifically to the 5.4--kb HindlI
fragment of the PAH clone containing the 4.0-kb polynorphic HindlII fragment

strongly that the exon 12 skipping mutation identified at the PAH mRNA level
resulted from a GT- >AT transition at the 5'-splice donor site of intron 12
of the mutant allele.
This exact mutation was subsequently verified by
sequence analysis of the cloned mutant gene (data not shown).
S1 Nuclease analysis of normal and mutant PAH RNA transcripts
In order to estimate the relative frequency of aberrant splicing among
RNA transcripts from the mutant PAH allele in the human liver, we performed S1
nuclease protection experiments using total RNA isolated from the subject
liver sample (Fig. 5). When the 1.3-kb PAH cDNA probe containing exons 7-13

5624

Nucleic Acids Research
plus part of the 3'-untranslated region was annealed to control human liver
RNA, a distinct SI nuclease resistant 994-bp fragment was detected (lane 1).
This fragment represented complete protection of the PAH cDNA (spanning
nucleotides 1038 to 2032) by the normal PAH mRNA transcript (Fig. 5,
schematic). An SI nuclease protection assay on the subject liver RNA sample
showed a 994-bp fragment protected by the normal PAH gene transcript, plus a
494-bp fragment of similar intensity (lane 2).
The latter fragment
represented protection of the PAH cDNA by a PAH mRNA species lacking the exon
12 sequence (Fig. 5, schematic). The data showed that the steady-state levels
of the normal and mutant PAH mRNA transcripts in the human liver are
comparable, suggesting that the predominant splicing event associated with the
mutant allele transcript in the human liver is exon 12 skipping.
DISCUSSION
We previously reported the isolation of eight partial-length

clones from a human liver cDNA library (3).

The

deletion of exon 12 sequence in the cDNA caused a frameshift mutation that
resulted in a premature stop codon which causes the deletion of 52 amino acids
from the C-terminus of PAH. Gene transfer and expression studies using the
mutant PAH cDNA demonstrated that it results in an unstable protein, thereby
abolishing PAH activity in the cell. The complete absence of PAH activity is
indicative of the Classical PKU phenotype and can be attributed specifically
to the loss of the C-terminal portion of PAH encoded by exon 12. The data is

comparable to the lack of immunoreactive protein in PKU liver biopsy specimens
reported by other laboratories (26-28).

Caucasians. Thus, the subject individual was a PKU carrier without a family
history of PKU, and contained a common mutant PAH allele. We recently
reported that PKU patients with mutant RFLP haplotype combinations 2//2, 2//3,
and 3//3 have the highest phenylalanine level in blood and follow a severe
c.linical course (25). Having established at the molecular and biochemical
levels that the mutations in the PAH gene associated with haplotype-2 (29) and
haplotype-3 (this manuscript) result in no detectable enzymatic activity, it
is understandable why these patients exhibit such severe biochemical and
clinical phenotypes.
SI nuclease protection experiments demonstrated that the levels of normal
and mutant PAH mRNA's were comparable, suggesting that the level of expression
and processing of both alleles into the respective mRNA products were similar
in the human liver cell. Thus, the possibility of mRNA instability being the
underlying cause of the PKIJ mutation can be ruled out. Furthermore, the exon
1l-exon 13 splice appeared to be the major product derived from the mutant
allele, with no cryptic splice sites being used to generate other aberrantly
spliced mRNA products in vivo. This aberrant splicing event utilizes the 5'
donor splice site of intron 11 and the 3'-acceptor splice site of intron 12
(Fig. 6).
What causes the exon 12 deletion in PKU? Normal intron splice sites in
eukaryotic genes have conserved GT and AC dinucleotides at the 5'-donor and
3'-acceptor sites, respectively (22,23).
13-thalassemia splicing mutations
have provided definitive evidence for the importance of these splice sites in
accurate RNA processing (24). In the human 3-globin gene, a G to A splice
donor site mutation in intron 2 completely inactivates the 5'-splice site of
this intron, and causes skipping of exon 2 in mature 13-globin mRNA in the
patient's bone marrow cells (31). Since there are only 3 exons in the
1-globin gene, exon 3 can only splice with exon I if skipping of the
preceding exon is the major consequence of the mutation in vivo. In the
mutant PAH gene, however, exon 13 could have been spliced with any of the
preceding 11 exons. The fact that the major mRNA product from this allele
only lacks exon 12 would suggest that this exon is disregarded by the splicing
machinery as a result of the GT to AT mutation at the splice donoti site of
intron 12. Similarly, in the hamster dihydrofolate reductase gene, a GT to CT
transition at the splice donor site of intron 5 causes skipping of exon 5, and
only exon 4 to exon 6 splice products were detected (30).
Whatever mechanism is involved in the exon skipping event, it must take

into account that the 3' acceptor splice site of the preceding intron (i.e.,
intron 11) is perfectly normal but is not utilized effectively in splicing
(Fig. 6). Mutant cDNA clones representing other aberrantly spliced products
were not present in the liver cDNA library suggesting exon 12 skipping is
indeed the major splicing event in the mutant RNA. There may be cooperative
interactions between the small ribonucleoprotein particles at the intron/exon
boundaries, such that the ribonucleoprotein particles cannot bind efficiently
to the 3' acceptor site of intron 11 if no interacting ribonucleoprotein
particles are present at the 5' donor site of intron 12. Under these
circumstances, exon 12 would have been regarded as part of an intron and
removed during splicing by joining together exons 11 and 13. This hypothesis
would suggest that not only introns, but also exons, are looped out during RNA
slicing in a splicesome (32).
