INTRODUCTION
Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a metabolic disease with
an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance (I). The defective
protein is the third enzyme of heme biosynthesis, porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD; EC 4.3.1.8, also referred to as
hydroxymethylbilane synthase or uroporphyrinogen I synthase). The enzyme activity is only half that of normal when
determined from patients' erythrocytes (2). Immunological
and biochemical studies have shown that AIP represents a
heterogeneous group of biochemical defects, and the disease
has previously been divided into four subtypes according to
the ratio of enzyme concentration and activity in erythrocytes
(cross-reacting immunologic material = CRIM negative or
positive subtypes) (3).
Recent molecular biological studies of PBGD have revealed
numerous mutations in the corresponding gene and demonstrated heterogeneity of AIP at the molecular level, despite
the relative uniformity of the clinical phenotype. Most of the
carriers of the affected gene are asymptomatic throughout their
lives, but 10-20% of patients experience occasional acute

attacks (4) which are potentially fatal and consist of abdominal
pain and various neuro-psychiatric symptoms (1).
The PBGD gene has been sequenced and characterized
(5-10). The 10 kb gene has been assigned to chromosome
1 Iq24 and contains 15 exons. Two tissue specific isoforms of
PBGD have been characterized. They are translated from
mRNAs transcribed from two promoters via alternative splicing
of exons 1 and 2. The two mRNAs differ only in their 5'
termini and thus, the housekeeping (non-erythropoietic) form
of mRNA encodes an enzyme of 361 amino acids, whereas
the tissue specific (erythroid) form lacks the first 17 amino
acids at the NH2 terminus. The single-strand conformation
polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was originally developed to
screen large cDNA or genomic regions for mutations and to
focus the sequencing efforts to limited fragments of the gene
(11). In this study we have analyzed the sensitivity of SSCP
analysis in the search for mutations in the PBGD gene among
Finnish, clinically well characterized AIP patients (4). Of the
19 mutations identified, 13 are novel and six mutations have

The sensitivity of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis for the detection of mutations
In the porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) gene among Finnish patients with acute Intermittent porphyria
(AIP) was studied. 13 novel mutations Including one de novo event, and six previously characterized mutations
were identified among AIP patients. The 19 mutations reported here for 28 families cover 72% of all the AIP
families in the Finnish population of five million. When compared to direct sequencing, SSCP-analysis
detected 17 (89%) of the 19 mutations when a combination of various electrophoretic conditions were used.
The most Informative electrophoretic condition was a gel run without glycerol In the coldroom (11/18
mutations). 86% of mutations were identified from amplified fragments greater than 300 bp and detection was
dependent on both the amount of glycerol In the gel and the running temperature, but seemed to be
Independent of the size of the analyzed fragment or the type of mutation. The diagnostic efficiency of
biochemical assays versus mutation screening In the PBGD gene was studied in three large AIP families,
each representing different CRIM subtypes of AIP. The results demonstrated that using assays of erythrocyte
PBGD activity, the majority (82%) of family members (n = 51) were diagnosed correctly. Of a total of 81 family
members, 30 of whom had deficiency of PBGD confined to non-erythroid tissues, diagnosis at the asymptomatic
stage of disease In 11 individuals (14%) required the application of mutation screening.

RESULTS
Results of SSCP analysis
Of the 33 genomic DNA samples, all representing different
Finnish AIP families, 22 samples showed mobility shifts in
SSCP analyses covering the complete gene (Fig. I). The 33
samples were studied as follows: all PCR fragments exons
3-15 inclusive were studied in 17 samples, exons 3-11
inclusive and exon 15 were studied in 22-23 samples, exon
10 alone was studied in 33 samples and exon 1 was studied
in six samples. When the mutations were analyzed under
various electrophoretic conditions, an extra band was detected
in 36 SSCP analyses, the distance between the two nearest
bands in a sample varying from 1.2 to 5.0 mm (Fig. 1). The
36 SSCP analyses from 16 different PCR fragments detected
15 different mutations when analyzed under three to five
different electrophoretic conditions. A shift represented a
mobility variation of > 3 mm compared to control fragments
in seven cases, 1-3 mm in ten and 0.5—0.9 mm in four cases.
Eight mutations from six different PCR fragments analyzed
under three to five different electrophoretic conditions, resulted
in shifts in 21 SSCP analyses.

transcript levels of many mutant alleles.

tional samples, no SSCP shift was detected, but two mutations
were identified by direct sequencing of the amplified genomic
DNA of six patients. These base changes (C517-»T and
G518—»A) were in the region of exon 10 where a nearby
polymorphic site (G606-»T, 17) complicates the interpretation
of SSCP analyses. Neither alteration of electrophoretic conditions nor the size of the PCR product (469 bp<-182 bp->78
bp) improved the results. In five cases, no mutation site in the
coding region of the PBGD gene was revealed by either SSCP
analyses or direct sequencing of patients' genomic DNA.

Effect of fragment length and mutation type
The length of the DNA fragments analyzed in SSCP analysis
varied from 88 to 510 bp. Of the 14 mutations analyzed from
fragments greater than 300 bp in size, 12 (86%) were detectable
by SSCP analysis. In two cases, alteration of the size of the
PCR product improved the sensitivity. In SSCP analyses of
deletion A97, both an increase and an decrease in the size of
the analyzed fragment (510 bp<-446 bp-»324 bp or 189 bp)

SSCP band as a sequencing template in one de novo case
In SSCP analysis of one sample, a band migrating more slowly
than normal was excised from the SSCP-gel, diluted and
reamplified (Fig. 2). The PCR product obtained was sequenced
after purification. Only the mutated sequence (T583) was
identified (Fig. 2) ensuring that the mobility shift detected was
caused by the mutation. The heterozygous state was confirmed
from the patient's amplified genomic DNA by direct sequencing. However, neither parent was a carrier of the mutation
and their biochemical analyses were entirely normal. Paternity
was confirmed using DNA fingerprint analysis (18). She was
the only AIP patient in the family suggesting a de novo event.
Identified mutations
So far we have identified a total of 19 mutations from the 28
families by direct sequencing of the coding regions (except
exon 2) and the exon-intron boundaries of the PBGD gene
(Table 1). Thus, a mutation has been identified in 72% of a
total of 39 Finnish AIP families.

Effect of running conditions
Initially all six versions of SSCP analysis were tested (0-510% glycerol gels run at either 23°C or 4°C). The glycerol
gels run in the coldroom detected the mutations poorly, and
consequently, at least three electrophoretic conditions, detecting
mutations most efficiently, were used to analyze all samples;
a 10% glycerol gel (1XTBE buffer) and a 5% glycerol gel
(0.5XTBE buffer) at 23°C, and a gel without glycerol (1XTBE
buffer) at 4°C, occasionally run also at 23°C.
With regard to the 19 mutations, gel electrophoresis at room
temperature with 10% and 5% glycerol detected 58% (11/19)
and 72 % (10/18) of mutations respectively while 78% (14/
18) were detected by gel electrophoresis without glycerol
in the coldroom. Overall, when a combination of various
electrophoretic conditions were used in screening, SSCP
analysis detected 17 (89%) of the 19 mutations finally identified
by direct sequencing.

from the original resulted in a shift. In SSCP analysis of
deletion A 10 ", even minor changes in the size of the fragment
(192 or 197 bp<—211 bp->228 bp) resulted in its disappearance.
Only five (range 107^446 bp) of the 19 fragments analyzed
under various electrophoretic conditions were SSCP positive
in all three conditions.
None of the 19 mutations in the PBGD gene were located
either at the 5' or 3' end of the analyzed fragment, the closest
being 23 bp from the 5' end ( C 4 9 9 - ^ . The GC content (mean
57%, range 43.6-63.6%) of the fragments was not significantly
increased in the analyzed fragments (P = 0.35).
Of the 14 pyrimidine to purine transversions, 12 (86%) were
detectable using SSCP analysis. Two purine to pyrimidine
transversions, a pyrimidine to pyrimidine and a purine to
purine transition, a splicing defect and two deletions were all
SSCP positive.

substitution (K98R) was predicted to alter the a-helix conformation in the PBGD protein. Two amino acid changes
(R116W, L238R) were predicted to change either the P-sheet
or the a-helix conformation. Most of the mutations were
predicted to change the local hydrophobicity pattern.
Analyses of cDNAs
Of the 13 CRIM negative mutations, a nucleotide change was
not identified from the cDNA in eight (61%) cases although
the mutation sites were directly sequenced both with sense and
antisense primers. Four mutations (R149X, W198X, R225X,
Q296X) creating immediate premature stop codons, were
not identified from their corresponding cDNA suggesting a
dramatic decrease in the steady state of the transcript level of
the mutated allele. However, in the case of two premature stop
codons located closer to the 5' end of the PBGD gene, the
Q34X in exon 4 and del A97, causing a stop codon 30 bp
away from the deletion site, the mutations were also identifiable
from the cDNA. In contrast to the cDNA analysis of R225X,

Of the 19 mutations, nine (47%) were arginine substitutions
resulting in amino acid changes in seven and a premature stop
codon in two cases (Table 1). The other seven point mutations
caused various amino acid changes in four cases and resulted
in a stop codon in three cases. In addition, one splicing defect
and two deletions were detected (Table 1). The deletion A97
in exon 4, causing a frameshift, resulted in a premature stop
codon 10 amino acids away from the deletion site. The deletion
A1073, located four amino acids away from the termination
codon, was predicted to result in a protein of 449 amino acids
long instead of the normal 361 amino acids of the PBGD
housekeeping enzyme. Thirteen (68%) of the 19 mutations
were family specific. Nine (47%) of the 19 mutations were
located in exons 10 and 12. Only two CRIM positive mutations
(R167W, R173Q) assigned to exon 10, showed clustering of
the families (Table 2).
The consequences of the mutations identified were predicted
by computer analyses (19,20). Three amino acid substitutions
(R26C, R167W, G280R) were predicted to alter the relative
proportion of the (3-sheet conformation and one amino acid

Human Molecular Genetics, 1995, Vol. 4, No. 2 219
substitution in the same codon (R225G), was correctly identified from the corresponding cDNA (Table 1).
Other mutants for which the cDNA was uniformative
included the deletion A1073 predicted to encode an extended
polypeptide, three CRIM negative point mutations (R116W,
L238R, G280R) predicted to result in amino acid substitutions,
and a mutation in the exonic consensus signal for splicing
(G33->T) of exon 1 (21).
All three CRIM positive mutations (R26C, R167W, R173Q)
were identified from amplified fragments of the patients'
cDNAs (15). The presence of the transcript of the mutated
allele in these cases is in accordance with the previous
hypothesis that CRIM positive mutations produce excessive
amounts of abnormal, inactive protein (3).

DISCUSSION
SSCP analyses
Since the original presentation of the SSCP analysis (11), this
technique has successfully been adapted to screen for mutations
in several genes (24). In this study, SSCP analysis was designed
to screen the complete gene coding for the housekeeping form
of PBGD in order to identify unknown mutations among
clinically and biochemically well characterized Finnish AIP
patients (4).

Identified mutations
Recent studies have so far identified around 50 mutations in
the PBGD gene, most of which are base substitutions, but in
addition, several mutations result in defective splicing, deletions and insertions, all of which cause amino acid changes in
the predicted polypeptide chain or are predicted to result in a
truncated protein. Thus, AIP is a heterogeneous group of
mutations according to several studies (9,13,14,16,28—42). Our
study represents the first study at the population level and
heterogeneity is also confirmed in the genetically isolated
population of Finland: we identified 19 mutations responsible
for AIP in Finland, 13 of which are new and have not been
previously identified in other populations.
Most Finnish mutations were family-specific, found only in
one or two families, although the spectrum of mutations is
more limited in CRIM positive patients. Of the three CRIM
positive mutations detected among the Finnish population, two
(R167W, R173Q) have also been identified in other populations,
such as the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands
(13,15,16,38). The third mutation (R26C) is located at the
same codon as another CRIM positive mutation (R26H)
reported from the United Kingdom (36). So far, a total of
seven different CRIM positive mutations have been reported
from European countries.
Of the 16 CRIM negative mutations found in Finland, four
( G 3 3 - ^ , R116W, R173Q, W198X) have also been identified
in Sweden (9,21,32) suggesting some similarities in the genetic
background of these populations. Surprisingly, the major Swedish mutation (W198X) found in about half of the AIP carriers
in Sweden, has been identified in only one Finnish family. This
family belongs to the minority Swedish speaking population of
Finland, and may have ancestors in Sweden. A splicing defect
(G33—»T) originally identified from a large Finnish family (12)
has also been detected in a Swedish family (21). The other
common mutations, R173W and the major Dutch mutation

DNA diagnosis of AIP
Identification of the 19 mutations in the PBGD gene provides
an opportunity for the precise diagnosis of AIP for 28 Finnish
AIP families. Screening of the family members was performed
using direct sequencing of the biotinylated and affinity captured
amplification products. Whenever a mutation altered a restriction enzyme cleavage site, restriction enzyme digestion (22)
was used to confirm the base change (Table 1). Detailed
screening for a mutation was tested in three families representing different subtypes of AIP (Table 2). In each family, the
results of the biochemical tests were available from more than
20 members. A total of 81 members from these large families
were screened. In 35% (28/81) of samples, the expected
mutation was detected (Table 2).
Biochemical tests (erythrocyte PBGD activity, U-PBG, UALA) did not reveal all the carriers, and rather resulted in
false negative cases in each family (Table 2). In the family
with the CRIM positive type 2 C 4 9 9 - ^ mutation, false
diagnostic data (low enzyme activity) were detected in four
healthy family members. This may be due to the relatively
low PBGD activity measured from both parents' erythrocytes
although the patients' father has been confirmed to be healthy.
Due to the tissue-specificity of PBGD, assays of erythrocyte
PBGD activity are useless in screening patients having a
mutation within the region of exon 1 (G33—»T, CRIM negative
type 2) (21,23). However, these assays detected 82% of patients
having a mutation site within both the erythroid and nonerythroid sequences of the PBGD gene (CRIM negative type
1 and CRIM positive type 1 and 2). In 11 family members
(14%), the results of biochemical tests resulted in a false
diagnosis and only by mutation screening alone was it possible
to demonstrate their carrier status. In each family, new carriers
of a mutation were detected among those who had urinary
PBG and erythrocyte PBGD activity within the normal or
nondiscriminatory range.

In our study, the primary PCR fragments amplified from
genomic DNA, were designed so that each fragment would
cover several exon and intron regions in order to reduce the
time and expense of SSCP analysis. Earlier studies have
emphasized the importance of correct fragment length (150200 bp) and the position of the base change in a fragment in
SSCP analysis (25). However, our results demonstrate that the
majority (86%) of mutations detected in the PBGD gene were
identifiable from fragments greater than 300 bp long.
Our extensive study of the conditions used in SSCP analysis
showed that the running temperature affected the analysis of
several fragments, and the detection of many mutations were
dependent on both the amount of glycerol in a gel and on the
running temperature. The most informative condition was
obtained when electrophoresis was carried out with no glycerol
in the coldroom. Some authors suggest that a shift should
represent a migration difference of at least 2 mm (26).
According to our experience even smaller differences between
the analyzed bands were reliably visualized and reproducible.
Screening for mutations by SSCP using cDNAs as a template, has been reported to be more informative than SSCP
analysis of genomic DNA (27). However, RNA samples from
patients are often not readily available, and as shown here,
the cDNAs do not necessarily include the transcript of the
mutated allele.

be employed whenever available. However, the family specificity of the observed mutations limits the potential of DNA
diagnostics in this disease.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Patients
A total of 33 Finnish AIP patients were analyzed representing 85% of the 39
identified AIP families in Finland (4). The patients were not related to each
other according to the extensive pedigree analyses and at least one of the
members in each family had a history of an acute attack. Eight of the 33
families were cross-reacting immunologic material (CRIM) positive, 24
families were CRIM negative (49) and one individual was not classified. The
diagnosis of AIP was based on increased excretion of porphobilinogen in the
urine (50) and/or on low PBGD activity in erythrocytes (51).
DNA and RNA extractions
DNA was extracted from leucocytes as described earlier (52,53). Total RNA
was prepared from lymphoblastoid cells using the guanidium isothiocyanate
method (54).
SSCP-analyses
PCR products for SSCP analysis (11,55) were designed to cover the whole
PBGD gene from exon 3 to 15 (Fig. 3). Exons 1 and 10 from several members
of AIP families have previously been screened by us using SSCP analysis
(15,21), and the information obtained earlier has been included in this study.
In addition, since exon 2 is transcribed only in erythroid tissues, it was
excluded from SSCP analysis of AIP families having defects in both erythroid
and non-erythroid tissues. Using the human cDNA sequences (6,7) original
PCR primers were designed by to amplify one to three exons and introns at
a time. Large PCR products *500 bp) were digested into shorter fragments
by suitable restriction enzymes (Fig. 3). When the size of the digested
fragments differed by more than 200 bp, a shorter running time was required
for better resolution of the shorter bands. Some sequencing primers were also
used in the PCR reaction in order to get shorter single fragments for SSCP
analysis (Fig. 3). The DNA (50 ng per sample) was amplified (56) with
specific primers, 25 pmol of each in 50 |il of solution, and 0.25 U Taq
polymerase (Promega, USA). The samples were radiolabelled during PCR by
adding 1.0 nCi of [oc-32P]dCTP or dGTP (Amersham.UK). The temperature
profile was 2 min at 94°C for the first denaturation step, then 30 s at 94°C,
30 s at 55-62°C and 30 s at 72°C for 30 cycles. The amplified fragments
over 500 bp in size were cleaved into smaller fragments with suitable
restriction enzymes according to the manufacturers' instructions (The New
England Biolabs, USA): exons 3-5 with Pstl and aTaq\ (879
bp->446+254+179 bp) or with Sma\ + aTaq\ (879 bp->190+510+179 bp),
exons 3-4 with Smal (567 bp-»243 + 324 bp), exons 5-7 with aTaq\ (687
bp->272+4l5 bp), exons 7-9 with aTaq\ (577 bp->237+340 bp) or with Msel
(577 bp-»264+206+107 bp), exons 10-11 with/Wall (715 bp-+445+270bp),
exons 12-14 with Psil (743 bp->432+3ll bp), exons 14-15 (the coding
region of exon 15) with Hphl (385 bp—> 174+211 bp), and exon 15 including
the non-coding region with Smal (497 bp->228+59+47+163 bp). Exons
1,4,9,10 and the coding region of exon 15 were also analyzed individually
(Fig. 3). The products were diluted 1:5 in 1% SDS/10 mM EDTA and mixed
with an equal volume (3 ^1) of 95% (vol/vol) formamide/20 mM EDTA
containing 0.05% bromophenol blue and 0.05% xylene cyanol.
After denaturation by heating at 80°C for 2 min, 3 nl of the sample was
run by electrophoresis in a 5% bis/acrylamide (60:1) gel (34.5 cmX80cmX0.4
mm) at 15-30 W ensuring no gel heating above 40°C for the appropriate
time. Various electrophoretic conditions were tested as follows; gels with 10%
(vol/vol) glycerol and 1 XTBE-buffer or 5% (vol/vol) glycerol and 0.5XTBEbuffer were run at room temperature, and gels without glycerol were run at
4°C. The gels were dried at 80°C for 1 h and autoradiography was at -70°C
for 12^*8 h.
Sequencing of the cDNA and the genomic DNA
The cDNA was synthesized using 5 |ig of total RNA by reverse transcription
from the specific primer at the 3' end of the non-coding region (5'CTGTGCCCCAGAAACCAG-3' or 5'-ACCTTCCAGAACTGGTTTATTA3') or alternatively from the 3' end of exon 7 (5'-TTGCAGATGGCTCCGATGGTGAA-3') (53). The first strand cDNA and the genomic DNA sequences
were amplified in 100 nl of each reaction mixture as described in SSCP
analysis except that no radiolabelled nucleotides were used. The PCR products
were purified using Magic PCR Prep Kit (Promega, USA) or Fluoricon-

R116W, were both originally identified in Sweden (9).
Although both Dutch and Swedish major mutations have also
been detected in Finland, no major mutation has been identified
among the Finnish AIP patients and interestingly, the deletion
A1073 was identified from a native Lappish Skolt, who belongs
to an ethnic minority of around 600 people in Northern Finland.
The R195C amino acid change in the region of exon 10 is the
first de novo mutation reported in the PBGD gene.
The close to 60 mutations so far identified in AIP patients,
suggesting a relatively high frequency of mutagenesis in this
gene, seem to be spread throughout the PBGD gene although
some clustering of the mutations in the 'hot spots' including
exons 10 and 12 is suggested. When the crystallographic
model of the PBGD polypeptide was recently produced from
the crystallized enzyme protein expressed in Escherichia coli
bacteria (43), five conserved arginine substitutions (R26, RI49,
R150, R167, R173) forming salt bridges with the acidic side
chains of the dipyrrolic cofactor (43), were shown to be of
crucial importance for the full activity of the enzyme (36). The
importance of exon 10 has been explained by the contribution of
the active-cleft or the binding of the dipyromethane factor in
this area (31,39).
Analyses of the patients' cDNA demonstrated that several
mutations—missense and nonsense mutations, deletions and a
splicing defect—could not be identified from patients' total
RNA after reverse transcription and amplification, the technique which typically requires at least 30% of the mutated
transcript to be present. Moreover, a considerable variation in
the mRNA level was detected between different nonsense
mutations in the PBGD gene or even between different
mutations in the same codon. Frequently nonsense or frameshift
mutations have been shown to be associated with dramatic
reductions of cytoplasmic mRNA, and generally, it is considered that the closer a termination codon is to the 3' end of a
gene, the higher is the level of the transcript (44). However,
our findings on the termination mutations identified close to
5' end of the PBGD gene were not in complete accordance
with this hypothesis. The concentration of mRNA can be
affected by transcription rate and the processing or transport
of RNA to the cytoplasm (44), and thus, several mechanisms
may be responsible for the deficiency of the mutated mRNA
species.
In AIP, early and specific diagnosis is essential (1). As
demonstrated here, biochemical tests have their limitations;
many patients do not excrete excess porphobilinogen or deltaaminolevulinic acid in urine at the asymptomatic stage although
analysis of urine is the method of choice during an acute
attack. The majority of patients having a mutation within both
the erythroid and the non-erythroid sequence of the PBGD
gene were detected using assays of erythrocyte PBGD acitivity.
However, the erythrocyte PBGD assay has a wide biological
range, results from patients and healthy relatives overlap thus
preventing a definite diagnosis (45), and it is useless in the
diagnosis of AIP patients having deficiency of PBGD in nonerythroid tissues alone (12,21,23,46). Classical Southern blot
RFLP analyses (47,48) gave either false negative (uninformative) or false positive results. This was mainly due to
the inconsistency of Mspl digestion found in our laboratory
which resulted in incorrect haplotype determination of family
members. As the detection of a known mutation in the PBGD
gene is technically relatively easy and the only specific
diagnostic method at the asymptomatic stage of AIP, it should

avidin-polystyrene-assay particles (Idexx Laboratories Inc., USA) if a biotin
labelled primer was used in the PCR reaction. The purified products were
sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (57). A
mutation site was sequenced both with sense and anti-sense primers.
