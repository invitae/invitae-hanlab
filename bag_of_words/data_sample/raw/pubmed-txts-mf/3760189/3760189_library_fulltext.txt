Abstract
Amyloid fibrils were isolated from cardiac tissue of two brothers
who died from familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) type
II. Sequence analysis on peptides derived from proteolytic cleavage with trypsin and fragmentation with cyanogen bromide reveal
that the fibril subunit protein is derived from plasma transthyretin
(prealbumin). About two-thirds of the fibril subunit protein was
found to contain an amino acid substitution at position 84 where
the normal isoleucine residue has been replaced by serine. Sequence analysis of the plasma transthyretin (prealbumin) from
the two brothers as well as two clinically diagnosed FAP type
II family members and two of four children of affected individuals
showed the presence of serine at position 84. The presence of
this substitution also correlates with low serum levels of retinolbinding protein and thus transthyretin (prealbumin) position 84
may be involved with the interaction of these two proteins.

sified chemically (9). Pras et al. described a variant transthyretin
(prealbumin) from the amyloid of a Jewish patient (10) and it
is now known that at least one Swedish kindred (1 1, 12), two
Japanese kindreds (13, 14), and the Portuguese patients with
amyloidosis (15) all have a variant transthyretin (prealbumin)
with a methionine substitution for valine at position 30 of the
127 amino acid residue transthyretin (prealbumin) molecule.
Recently we found that affected individuals in the Indiana/
Swiss kindred have low serum levels of retinol-binding protein
(RBP), whereas other kindreds do not (16). Since RBP binds to
transthyretin (prealbumin) in the plasma, this led us to postulate
that another transthyretin (prealbumin) variant is present in this
condition. To investigate this we have isolated and structurally
characterized the amyloid protein of the Indiana/Swiss type.

Methods

1. Abbreviations used in this paper: FAP, familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RBP, retinol-binding protein.

Amyloid-laden tissue was obtained postmortem from two brothers who
died of cardiac insufficiency and who had been diagnosed as having FAP
type II. Amyloid fibrils were isolated from 30-g samples of heart tissue
by the procedure of Pras et al. ( 17). The fibril subunit protein was then
isolated from fibril concentrates by denaturation, reduction, alkylation,
and size exclusion chromatography as previously described (12). The
subunit protein (4 mg) was digested with trypsin and the peptides separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
on a column (1 X 25 cm) of Synchrom RP-8 resin. When necessary,
peptides were repurified on Altex Ultrasphere C-18 or Waters bondapakphenyl columns. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was done
as previously described (1 1).
The amyloid subunit protein and plasma transthyretin (prealbumin)
were cleaved with cyanogen bromide as reported previously (18). To 2
mg of amyloid subunit protein was added 0.5 ml of deoxygenated 70%
formic acid and 2 mg of cyanogen bromide. The mixture was stirred in
the dark at room temperature for 24 h and then dried under vacuum.
The peptides were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 50% acetic acid and separated
by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a column (1
X 25 cm) of Synchrom RP-P resin using a 2-propanol gradient (0-56%
during 90 min) to elute the peptides.
All protein and peptide samples were degraded in an 890C liquidphase sequenator (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA) using the
0.1 M Quadrol buffer program. 3 mg of polybrene was added to each
sample to reduce extractive losses. Amino acid analyses were performed
on a 1 19C instrument (Beckman Instruments, Inc.). All samples were
hydrolyzed under vacuum for 24 h at 1 15°C using 5.7 N double-distilled
HCO that contained 2 mg of phenol to reduce oxidation.
Plasma transthyretin (prealbumin) was isolated using a three-step
procedure involving DEAE Sephadex ion exchange chromatography,
Affigel Blue dye ligand affinity chromatography, and size exclusion chromatography as has been reported previously (18). After denaturation in
70% formic acid the protein was digested with trypsin and the peptides
separated by reverse-phase HPLC as for the amyloid subunit protein (19).

Introduction
In 1956 Rukavina et al. (1) reported a large kindred of Swiss
descent with hereditary amyloidosis who had settled in northeastern Indiana. At the time the clinical features of this malady
were distinctive from the familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy
(FAP)1 in Portuguese families that was described by Andrade
(2). The Indiana/Swiss type of amyloidosis was characterized by
early onset of the carpal tunnel syndrome followed by a more
generalized peripheral neuropathy, blindness from vitreous deposits of amyloid, and cardiomyopathy. Unlike the Portuguese
FAP, clinically significant renal involvement was absent. While
a number of other kindreds with amyloidosis have been described
in the last 30 years (Japanese, Swedish, Danish, Iowa, German,
French) (3-8), the Indiana/Swiss syndrome has remained clinically distinct. Only the Maryland kindred described by Mahloudji, which also has a high incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome,
clinically resembles the Indiana syndrome (7).
With the discovery that amyloid fibrils in the autosomal
dominant amyloidoses were composed of transthyretin (prealbumin), it became obvious that these amyloidoses might be clasAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Dr. Benson, Chief,

individuals had enlarged hearts that weighed 900 and 750 g,
respectively. From 30 g of starting tissue both samples yielded
-100 mg of water extract protein and 2 g of top layer protein.
Both fractions were highly enriched for amyloid fibrils as demonstrated by Congo red staining. After denaturation, reduction,
and alkylation, the fibril subunit protein was isolated by size
exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1). On sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS)-PAGE, peak IV was found to have molecular mass of
14,000 D and to be size homogeneous. Reverse-phase HPLC
also revealed a single major protein peak. The other fractions
were found to be heterogeneous by the above criteria. From 200
mg of starting fibril material 14 mg of peak IV was isolated,
and it accounted for -20% of the solubilized isolated proteins.
Sequence analysis of peak IV material revealed a heterogeneous structure from which the parent molecule could not easily
be identified. The cyanogen bromide fragmented material gave
an HPLC profile that was indiscernible from non-FAP type I
transthyretins (prealbumins). Sequence analysis of the major cyanogen bromide peptide provided a sequence that was identical
to that from positions 14-52 of normal plasma transthyretin
(prealbumin). Tryptic digestion of peak IV material generated
a peptide mixture that gave the reverse-phase HPLC profile seen
in Fig. 2. In general, peptides were isolated in 90% or greater
purity. Amino acid composition and sequence analysis revealed
that these peptides were derived from plasma transthyretin
(prealbumin): the only primary structure difference was that
peptide TlO' (residues 81-103) was found to have a serine instead
of the normal isoleucine at position 84 (Table I). The amino
terminal peptide started predominately from transthyretin
(prealbumin) position 5, but longer and shorter peptides were
also present. Finally, for a preparation from one of the brothers,
peptide 7-8 (residues 49-76) appeared to have both a glycine
and the normal threonine at position 49. The two small peaks
after peptides 10' and 10 had amino acid compositions and sequence analysis consistent with their being derived from 10' and
10 with arginine 104 attached to the carboxyl terminal. Se-

(1 X 25 cm) of Synchrom RP-8 resin. The column was equilibrated in
0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and the peptides eluted with a linear gradient
from 0 to 35% acetonitrile generated over 75 min. The flow rate was 2
ml/min and the column was maintained at room temperature. Peaks
are numbered to correspond to the tryptic peptides as noted in Fig. 3.

quenator yield data for all major peptides are shown in Table
II while the alignment of all peptides are shown in Fig. 3.
Tryptic peptide HPLC maps for FAP type II and normal
plasma transthyretin (prealbumin) can be seen in Fig. 4. These
profiles are identical except that the FAP type II protein has
peak 10'. By sequence analysis this peak contains residues 81103 of the transthyretin (prealbumin) molecule with a replacement at position 84 of a serine for the normal isoleucine.

Discussion
While large amounts of amyloid fibrils were isolated from the
cardiac tissue, there was a low recovery of fibrils in the water
supernatant, which is comparable with that seen for FAP type
I tissue samples (1 1). To obtain the best yields of the subunit
protein, solubilization in 8 M guanidine required 48-72 h to
dissociate the fibril subunit proteins from the matrix proteins.
Sequence analysis of peak IV material revealed a multiple sequence. Review of these data after further studies on the tryptic
peptides revealed that this fraction was composed of transthyretin
(prealbumin) and that -40% of the material being sequenced
started at position 5 of the transthyretin (prealbumin) molecule
with an additional 20-30% starting at positions 4 and 6.
The cyanogen bromide digest was done on two samples of
the amyloid subunit protein. The first cleavage was performed
using subunit protein obtained from the top-layer material. Sequence analysis of the major cyanogen bromide polypeptide gave
the same amino acid residues as the starting material, which
indicates that little or no cleavage had occurred. However, when
the cyanogen bromide digest was performed on the subunit protein isolated from the water wash material, the major peptide
isolated by HPLC gave a single sequence starting at position 14
of the transthyretin (prealbumin) molecule. This sequence was
extended to position 52 with no differences from normal transthyretin (prealbumin) (Table II).
The tryptic digest of the subunit protein from one of the
brothers gave the profile seen in Fig. 2. There are only a few
differences in this profile from that of normal transthyretin
(prealbumin). First, the amino terminal peptide (T 1) in the subIndiana/Swiss Hereditary Amyloid Sequence

unit protein elutes slightly earlier and is broader. This is most
likely due to the facts that it is truncated and has a heterogeneous
amino terminal. Second, peptide T2 (residues 10-15) was isolated
in poor yields with limited recovery of carboxymethyl cysteine
and methionine on amino acid analysis. Also, peptides T5-6
(residues 35-48) and T6 (residues 36-48) were isolated in very
low yields (the small unlabeled peaks at 42 and 45 min, Fig. 2)
and of insufficient purity for reliable sequence analysis. These
findings are consistent with the cysteine 10, methionine 13, and
tryptophane 41 all being partially or completely oxidized in the
fibrils. That the subunit protein from top-layer fibril material
did not show significant cleavage with cyanogen bromide is also
consistent with oxidation of the methionine 13. This is in contrast
to FAP type I fibrils, which show no such oxidation. This difference may be due to the tissue in which the fibrils are deposited.
In most FAP type I preparations the fibrils are isolated from
kidney, while in FAP type II the fibrils are isolated from the
heart. Since the heart is a very oxygen-rich organ it is possible
that long-term exposure to these levels of oxygen leads to oxidation of these sensitive residues. Coupled to this it can be proposed that those fibrils found in the water wash are more recently
formed and have not yet been oxidized or tightly entangled in
the cellular matrix.
The peptide for residues 81-103 was found in two peaks
(TI0 and T10'). Peptide TI0 had the normal sequence while
peptide TlIV had the same sequence but at position 84 the normal
isoleucine had been replaced by a serine. Lastly, in one of the
samples the peak for peptide T7-8 (residues 49-76) had a clearly
observable shoulder, and on compositional analysis showed an
extra half-residue of glycine. Upon sequence analysis both glycine
and threonine were seen at the amino terminus of this peptide
(position 49), while all other residues were the same as normal.
If this were a real amino acid replacement it would represent a
double substitution. This is of interest because it was initially
reported that a Jewish hereditary amyloid also had a glycine at
position 49 (10). Sequence analysis of amyloid subunit protein

from the second brother with FAP type II revealed no glycine
at position 49. This, coupled to the fact that the cyanogen bromide sequence data only showed threonine at position 49, has
led us to believe that the glycine is not part of the polypeptide
backbone but instead is the result of a chemical linkage of a
residue of glycine to an amino acid side chain (probably serine,
threonine, or lysine).
In an attempt to confirm if the glycine residue is part of the
primary structure or is attached to the prealbumin molecule
either before or after its incorporation into the fibrils, we isolated
transthyretin (prealbumin) from the plasma of the two deceased
brothers, two clinically proven affected family members, and
four children of clinically affected individuals as well as ofnormal
individuals. For all individuals the yield ofisolated transthyretin
(prealbumin) was 35-45% of theoretical, which is the range we
have seen for this method (18). Because of the high stability of
transthyretin (prealbumin) it is necessary to denature the protein
before trypsin digestion. For these proteins we used the method
of Nakazato et al. with incubation in 70% formic acid at room
temperature for 18 h (19). We found this method acceptable,
but only 20-40% of the molecules were fragmented with trypsin
in this manner. To ascertain that neither the normal or variant
protein was preferentially cleaved by trypsin, the undigested
proteins from preparations of two affected individuals were redigested with trypsin. HPLC peptide profiles of these materials
showed essentially complete cleavage and did not differ significantly from the first trypsin-digested material. The pattern for
the two deceased brothers and two affected family members is
seen in Fig. 4 A while the pattern for normal transthyretin
(prealbumin) is seen in Fig. 4 B. For both profiles, the patterns
are identical except in the affected individuals where peak TlIO
is observed. Sequence analysis reveals that this is peptide 81103 with a serine for isoleucine at position 84. Sequence analysis
of peptide 7 and 7-8 both show only threonine at position 49
for all individuals tested. Since peptides T2, T5-6, and T6 were

Figure 4. (A) Elution profile showing the separation of the peptides
formed from trypsin digestion of plasma transthyretin (prealbumin) (3
mg) from an individual with FAP type H. Separation was obtained on
a Synchrom RP-8 column (1 X 25 cm) using 0.1% TFA in water at a
2 ml/min flow rate as the initial buffer. A double gradient from 0 to
10% acetonitrile in 10 min followed by a gradient from 10 to 35% acetonitrile in 75 min was used to effect separation of the peptides. (B)
Separation of the peptides derived from a trypsin digestion of normal
plasma transthyretin (3 mg). Conditions were the same as above. All
peaks are numbered as in Fig. 2. The two peaks labeled 9 gave identical composition and sequence analyses and may represent modification of the indole ring of Trp 79.

loss of cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan, this is consistent
with the loss of these residues in the fibril subunit protein being
due to tissue oxidation.
From these studies it would seem that the glycine that appears
to be at position 49 is not part of the primary structure and that
it is not attached to transthyretin (prealbumin) in the plasma.
It is possible that the residue is attached after the fibrils are deposited into the tissue and that this modification may be tissue
specific. This would explain the presence of the adduct in some
amyloid-laden tissues but not in others as has been reported in
the amyloid of Jewish origin (16, 19).
For the four presymptomatic individuals whose transthyretin
(prealbumin) were studied, two of them had peptide TlOV and
two did not. Prior studies show that affected individuals in this
kindred have low RBP levels, which was true for the two presymptomatic individuals who had peptide TlO'. Therefore, it
appears that the occurrence of low plasma RBP levels is associated with the position 84 substitution and may be used to
identify carriers of the abnormal gene.
All the individuals with the gene coding for seine 84 showed

deposition the variant transthyretin (prealbumin) accounted for
20-25% of the total plasma concentration. However, in individuals not exhibiting active disease the variant concentration
was between 30 and 35% of the total serum transthyretin (prealbumin) level. This is consistent with what has been seen in FAP
type I individuals and probably represents the enriched deposition of the variant protein in the amyloid fibrils with the resultant depletion of the plasma (12).
From the x-ray structure of the transthyretin (prealbumin)
molecule it has been determined that position 84 is located on
an external loop on the outer surface of the protein between
beta sheet strands E and F (20). This position is on one of the
most exposed segments of the molecule, and how this substitution leads to the formation of fibrils is uncertain. However,
certain features would appear to be important. Position 84 is at
the end of a short alpha helical region (positions 78-83) and a
mutation from isoleucine to serine will have effects on hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding. Since low ionic strength is
known to dissociate transthyretin (prealbumin) and RBP, it
would appear that hydrophobic interactions may play an important role in the association of these proteins (21). Thus, the
replacement of isoleucine at position 84 with a serine would
lead to a major reduction of hydrophobicity in this region and
may lead to a higher dissociation constant for these proteins.
This reduced affinity for RBP could explain the low serum levels
of RBP because unbound to transthyretin (prealbumin) it is
quickly cleared by the kidneys (22). How the serine at position
84 will alter the protein structure will have to await x-ray structure
analysis of the variant protein.
From the genetic code and transthyretin (prealbumin) complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence it is clear that the change
from isoleucine to serine involves a single base substitution where
the second codon is changed from a uracil (thymine) to a guanine
(23-25). This replacement of a purine for a pyrimidine base
should alter the DNA so that specific nucleases will give different
patterns for the normal and variant genes. Thus, it should be
possible to identify carriers ofthis trait by differences in restriction
nuclease patterns as has already been shown for the methionine
for valine substitution in FAP type I individuals (26) and for
alanine for threonine substitution in FAP Appalachian (27).
