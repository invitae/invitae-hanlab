Amyloid fibrils were isolated from cardiac tissue of two brothers who died from familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) type II. Sequence analysis on peptides derived from proteolytic cleavage with trypsin and fragmentation with cyanogen bromide reveal that the fibril subunit protein is derived from plasma transthyretin (prealbumin). About two-thirds of the fibril subunit protein was found to contain an amino acid substitution at position 84 where the normal isoleucine residue has been replaced by serine. Sequence analysis of the plasma transthyretin (prealbumin) from the two brothers as well as two clinically diagnosed FAP type II family members and two of four children of affected individuals showed the presence of serine at position 84. The presence of this substitution also correlates with low serum levels of retinol-binding protein and thus transthyretin (prealbumin) position 84 may be involved with the interaction of these two proteins.
