ABSTRACT
Saposins are small, heat-stable glycoproteins
required for the hydrolysis of sphingolipids by specific lysosomal hydrolases. Saposins A, B, C, and D are derived by
proteolytic processing from a single precursor protein named
prosaposin. Saposin B, previously known as SAP-1 and sulfatide activator, stimulates the hydrolysis of a wide variety of
substrates including cerebroside sulfate, GM1 ganglioside, and
globotriaosylceramide by arylsulfatase A, acid 8-galactosidase, and a-galactosidase, respectively. Human saposin B
deficiency, transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, results
in tissue accumulation of cerebroside sulfate and a clinical
picture resembling metachromatic leukodystrophy (activatordeficient metachromatic leukodystrophy). We have examined
transformed lymphoblasts from the initially reported saposin
B-deficient patient and found normal amounts of saposins A, C,
and D. After preparing first-strand cDNA from lymphoblast
total RNA, we used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify
the prosaposin cDNA. The patient's mRNA differed from the
normal sequence by only one C -- T transition in the 23rd
codon of saposin B, resulting in a threonine to isoleucine amino
acid substitution. An affected male sibling has the same mutation as the proband and their heterozygous mother carries
both the normal and mutant sequences, providing additional
evidence that this base change is the disease-causing mutation.
This base change results in the replacement of a polar amino
acid (threonine) with a nonpolar amino acid (isoleucine) and,
more importantly, eliminates the glycosylation signal in this
activator protein. One explanation for the deficiency of saposin
B in this disease is that the mutation may increase the degradation of saposin B by exposing a potential proteolytic cleavage
site (arginine) two amino acids to the amino-terminal side of the
glycosylation site when the carbohydrate side chain is absent.
The lysosomal hydrolysis of sphingolipids is catalyzed by the
sequential action of acid hydrolases. Several small heatstable glycoproteins called sphingolipid activator proteins
have been discovered that act as natural nonspecific detergents, or stimulate a specific hydrolase, or both. The complete nucleotide sequence of a cDNA encoding prosaposin,
the precursor of saposins A, B, C, and D, has been elucidated
(1, 2). Prosaposin is a 524-amino acid glycoprotein and
examination of its amino acid sequence reveals four saposin
domains. Each domain is -80 amino acid residues long; has
nearly identical placement of cysteine residues, glycosylation
sites, and helical regions; and is flanked by potential proteolytic cleavage sites (lysine or arginine). Proteolytic cleavage
of prosaposin at or near these dibasic amino acids was
predicted to give rise to four saposin proteins (1). Each of

these four saposin proteins has now been isolated and their
activating properties have been determined (3-14).
Saposins A and C specifically activate hydrolysis of glucocerebroside byB-glucosylceramidase (D-glucosyl-N-acylsphingosine glucohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.45) and of galactocerebroside by galactosylceramidase (D-galactosyl-N-acylsphingosine galactohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.46) (3, 4). Saposin D
specifically activates the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by
sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase (sphingomyelin cholinephosphohydrolase; EC 3.1.4.12) (5). Saposins A, C, and D
appear to exert their activities by binding to the respective
enzymes, raising the maximal velocity of hydrolysis and
lowering the Michaelis constant (5, 6) (S.M. and Y.K.,
unpublished data).
Saposin B, previously designated by several different
terms (7, 10, 14, 15), stimulates the hydrolysis of galactocerebroside sulfate by arylsulfatase A (aryl-sulfate sulfohydrolase; EC 3.1.6.1) (7-9), GM1 ganglioside by acid 13galactosidase (J3-D-galactoside galactohydrolase; EC 3.2.
1.23) (10, 11), and globotriaosylceramide by a-galactosidase A (a-D-galactoside galactohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.22) (12,
13). This activator protein may have even broader substrate
specificity since it also is an activator of glycerolipid hydrolysis (14). Saposin B activates by a mechanism different from
saposins A, C, and D; it interacts with lipid substrates
solubilizing them for enzymatic hydrolysis. The physiological significance of saposin B is underscored by the discovery
of its absence in a variant form of metachromatic leukodystrophy (activator-deficient metachromatic leukodystrophy)
(16-18). In this report, we present evidence for a single base
change as the molecular defect in activator-deficient metachromatic leukodystrophy found in two siblings of consanguineous parents and propose that this mutation gives rise to
a glycosylation site defect. These results were previously
presented independently in preliminary form by our group
and by Wenger et al. (19, 20).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Quantitation of Saposins. A HPLC method was developed
to quantitate the levels of saposins. Transformed lymphoblasts from proband YF with saposin B deficiency and a
normal control were grown in suspension culture and collected by precipitation. After washing in phosphate-buffered
saline the cell pellets were lyophilized, resuspended, homogenized, boiled, and centrifuged. Supernatant proteins were
fractionated by HPLC sequentially on two columns, a hydrophobic Vydac C4 column (The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) using an acetonitrile gradient followed by an

first column, saposins A, C, and D were collected as clustered peaks and on the second column, they were separated
as individual peaks, which were quantified. Details of this
method will be given in a separate report (S.M. and Y.K.,
unpublished data). Saposin B had previously been shown to
be nearly absent in cultured cells from patient YF by a
quantitative immunologic method (17). We also could not
detect saposin B in lymphoblasts from patient YF after
SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting with monospecific antisaposin B antibodies.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Amplification of Prosaposin cDNA. Total RNA was isolated from transformed
lymphoblasts of the index patient by using the RNA isolation
kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA was then prepared by
using the Red Module (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) as primer
according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed as described by Saiki et al. (21). Frozen cell culture
stocks of skin fibroblasts from EF, the affected brother of
YF, and her mother were used as the source of the RNA for
analysis of these samples.
Sequencing. Initially, prosaposin cDNA was cloned into
pBS-Il (Stratagene) and multiple clones were sequenced
using the Sequenase kit (United States Biochemical) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Direct sequencing of
PCR products was performed according to Kretz et al. (22).
The PCR products were separated from the primers on a 1%
NuSieve (FMC) low-melt agarose gel. The bands were excised and melted at 68°C. The sequencing primer was annealed to the PCR product by heating at 95°C for 10 min and
quickly cooling to 37°C. Sequencing was then carried out
with the Sequenase kit according to the manufacturer's
instructions except that the labeling reaction was carried out
at 37oC.¶
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
It was reported earlier that the proband YF had a severe
deficiency of saposin B in fibroblasts (<5% of normal) (16,
17). Since saposin B is generated by proteolytic processing of
a precursor that also gives rise to three other activator
proteins (1), it was important to determine the levels of the
other three activator proteins in this patient. HPLC analysis
of normal and saposin B-deficient lymphoblasts showed no
deficiency of saposin A, C, or D in the proband YF (Table 1),
suggesting that the defect was localized to the region encoding saposin B.
PCR amplification was performed to generate enough
copies of the prosaposin cDNA for nucleotide sequencing.
Primers were constructed so that the sequence of the entire

deposited in the

prosaposin open reading frame and some 3' flanking sequence totaling 2170 base pairs could be analyzed (Fig. 1).
Initially, the product from patient YF was cloned into the
phagemid pBS II and several clones were sequenced. A
single C -- T transition was found in the 23rd codon of
saposin B (Fig. 2), a single base change resulting in the
replacement of a threonine residue by an isoleucine residue
(Fig. 3). No other base changes were found after sequencing
the entire prosaposin open reading frame. These results are
in accord with those recently reported by Wenger et al. (20).
To provide additional evidence that this base substitution
is the disease-causing mutation, we amplified prosaposin
cDNA from fibroblast RNA from the affected brother of the
proband (EF), her mother, and several controls, sequencing
the PCR products directly. As expected, EF has the same
base change as YF, and her mother has two bands of
approximately equal intensity at this position, representing
the normal and mutant alleles (Fig. 2). Samples from three
normal subjects each gave the normal sequence at this
position.
We propose that the single base change is a point mutation
that generates proteolytically sensitive saposin B. After
removal of its signal peptide, prosaposin is glycosylated at
five glycosylation sites [two in saposin A, one each in
saposins B, C, and D (1, 3,5, 23)]. Prosaposin is proteolyzed
to generate saposins A, B, C, and D, with cleavage occurring
at or near basic dipeptides at their polypeptide boundaries (1,
2, 24). We propose that the point mutation in the F family
abolishes the glycosylation site in saposin B (Asn-Xaa-Thr;
Fig. 3) and exposes an arginine residue two residues amino
terminal from this site due to the absence of the carbohydrate
side chain that normally protects this site from cleavage.
Previously, we analyzed the structure of saposin B by helical
wheel depictions of its helical structure and analysis of
hydropathy plots. We concluded that the region in question
is hydrophilic and exposed at a turn of the polypeptide chain.
Since normal processing of prosaposin occurs by proteolysis
at dibasic amino acid residues, proteolytic enzymes are
present that could accomplish cleavage of the mutant protein
at the exposed arginine. This proposal is consonant with
pulse-chase experiments in fibroblasts from YF in which
prosaposin is normally synthesized and excreted in the
presence of ammonium chloride but mature saposin B is not
detected (25). The availability of a rapid PCR-based screening

method with direct sequencing to detect the defect will be
useful in diagnosing additional patients with this disease.
Examination of the primary structures of saposins A, C,
and D revealed that each of the glycosylation sites (two sites
in saposin A, and one site each in saposins C and D) has either
arginine or lysine, or both, residues within three amino acids
of the glycosylation signal. Similarly, inspection of the amino
acid sequence of the rat sulfated glycoprotein (SGP-1) (26),
known to be 76% homologous to the protein sequence of the
human SAP precursor, showed that three of its four glycosylation sites have closely associated arginine or lysine
residues. These observations are consistent with the highly
conserved structures of these proteins and, moreover, suggest that mutational events destroying other glycosylation
sites might also result in the absence of gene product due to
the unmasking of proteolytic sites.
Glycosylation of proteins has been proposed as a means to
retard proteolysis by altering conformation and by protecting
sensitive sites (27, 28). Several proteins (including fibroblast
fibronectin, acetylcholine receptor of embryonic muscle, and
myoblast fusion protein) were found to be degraded more
rapidly when cell cultures were treated with tunicamycin, a
specific inhibitor of protein glycosylation. The increased
cellular degradation of the nonglycosylated proteins was
partially arrested by proteinase inhibitors in vivo and it was
found that nonglycosylated proteins were degraded more
rapidly by specific proteases in vitro. This led to the proposal
(27, 29, 30) that specific cleavage sites are unmasked by the
absence of carbohydrate side chains. To our knowledge the
mutation reported here, in which abolition of a glycosylation
site could lead to accelerated proteolysis and human disease,
has not been reported elsewhere.

FIG. 3. Result of the mutation found in saposin B-deficient
patient YF. The DNA sequence and the deduced protein sequence
of both the normal and patient samples are shown. Boldface type
indicates the differences between the normal and the patient sequences. The asterisk denotes the position of the potential glycosylation site in the normal sequence. The arrow denotes the potential
site of proteolytic cleavage exposed when the asparagine at residue
21 is not glycosylated.

To further inquire whether mutations of the type reported
here might be more generalized, we undertook a brief survey
of other human proteins by using the Protein Identification
Resource (National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, version 22) computer data base. The search looked,
first, for the presence of glycosylation signals (Asp-Xaa-Ser
or Thr) and, second, for arginine or lysine residues within five
amino acids on either side of the signal. The results of the
search are as follows: (i) fibronectin contains 11 potential
glycosylation sites, 3 with proximal proteolytic cleavage
sites; (ii) the acetylcholine receptor a-chain precursor contains a single glycosylation site with a lysine two residues
away; (iii) 6 lysosomal proteins, excluding prosaposin, contain a total of 24 potential glycosylation sites, 10 with nearby
lysine or arginine residues; (iv) 13 unselected glycoproteins
exhibited 47 glycosylation sites, 24 with associated lysine
and/or arginine residues. Thus, 46% of the 83 glycosylation
signals found in this survey have closely associated potential
proteolytic sites. These results hint that the molecular defect
reported here may be a member of a possible large class of
mutations.
