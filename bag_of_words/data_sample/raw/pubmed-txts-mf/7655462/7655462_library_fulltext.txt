INTRODUCTION
Fibroblast growth factor receptors are a family of related
signalling proteins which span the cell membrane (1,2). They
are tyrosine kinases which are activated by fibroblast growth
factors binding extracellularly in the presence of proteoglycans
and are expressed from embryo gastrulation onwards. The
extracellular domain contains three immunoglobulin loops
(Fig. 1). In FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3 the third immunoglobulin domain consists of two isoforms, Hlb and IIIc, which
differ in their carboxyl ends and whose expression is cell-type
specific. The two forms are created by alternative splicing in
which one of two exons, (also referred to as exon Mb or IIIc
*To whom correspondence should be addressed

in this paper) is spliced to an invariant upstream exon, IIIu
(Fig. 1).
The family of human FGFR genes contains four members
which map to chromosome 8 (FGFR1), 10 (FGFR2), 4
(FGFR3) and 5 (FGFR4). Mutations associated with three
members of the FGFR family have been found in human
malformation syndromes. Mutation of a single nucleotide in
the transmembrane domain of FGFR3 accounts for almost all
cases of achondroplasia (3,4,28). Mutations in FGFR2 and
FGFR1 have been found in the syndromes Crouzon, Pfeiffer,
Apert and Jackson-Weiss (5-9), all of which involve craniosynostosis as a common feature. Changes in the digits vary
from normal development in Crouzon syndrome, through
broadening of the thumbs and great toes in Pfeiffer syndrome
to severe syndactyly in Apert syndrome. To date mutations
causing Crouzon syndrome have been reported only in exon
IIIc of FGFR2. In view of the patterns of expression of
Iglllb and IIIc (10,11), we had previously predicted, and
demonstrated, that mutations in patients with Crouzon syndrome would occur in exon IIIc (5). In view of the failure to
find mutations in 11 of 20 patients in the initial study, we
extended the screen to include exon IIIu, which forms the
other half of the IgHI loop and is common to both forms.

RESULTS
Patients
All patients showed typical features of Crouzon syndrome, of
which the principal features were craniosynostosis, associated
proptosis and mid-face hypoplasia. In particular there was no
significant broadening of the thumbs or big toes. The diagnosis
in all cases was clinical, with occasional radiological confirmation of normal limb anatomy. Several patients manifested
minor digital abnormalities such as 2/3 syndactyly, commonly
found in the normal population and consistent with a Crouzon
phenotype (Fig. 2). Two patients have been described previously (C7 in ref. 23, 12529 in ref. 27).

Craniosynostosis, which affects approximately 1 in
2000 children, is the result of the abnormal development and/or premature fusion of the cranial sutures.
Studies of mutations in patients with craniosynostosis have shown that the family of fibroblast
growth factor receptor genes are extremely important
in the correct formation of the skull, and digits.
Mutations in the third immunoglobulin domain of
fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), in part
of the molecule corresponding to a tissue specific
isoform (Me), can cause both Crouzon and Pfeiffer
syndromes. Two specific mutations in the linking
region between the second and third immunoglobulin
domains of FGFR2 occur in Apert syndrome. We
present here mutations associated with the Crouzon
syndrome, also in the third immunoglobulin domain
but in an upstream exon. This exon is expressed in
both tissue isoforms. Five different mutations were
detected in 11 unrelated individuals. A cysteine to
phenylalanine change was found in six individuals.
This cysteine forms half of the disulphide bridge
maintaining the secondary structure of the immunoglobulin domain. The first deletion within an FGFR
gene is reported. Together with mutations in exon Illc
these account for 25 mutations out of 40 Crouzon
patients studied in our combined series (5).

analysis (SSCP).
SSCP analysis of exon IIIu revealed a number of different
band shifts. DNA from patients with band shifts was sequenced
and five mutations found. Several of the patients appeared to
have an identical band shift. The first three of these patients
to be analysed showed a TGC to TTC mutation, changing a
cysteine at position 278 to phenylalanine. As this creates a
Bbsl restriction site, all the remaining samples were tested for
creation of this site. Six patients were found with the mutation
(Fig. 3).
A full list of the mutations found is presented in Table 1.
The mutations were shown, by restriction enzyme analysis in
both parents and the child, to arise de novo in three of the
patients with a Cys278Phe change, in the patient with a
Gln289Pro mutation and the Ser267Pro mutation. The
mutations include a deletion of nine base pairs resulting in a
three amino acid deletion. In this case, which is sporadic, the
smaller fragment which is revealed most clearly after Mnll
digestion, was shown to have arisen de novo. This is the first
deletion described in the fibroblast growth factor receptor
genes.
One other recurrent mutation is found, Trp290Arg. None of
the mutations described occur at the sequence CpG.
Identification of further mutations in exon Hie
Exon IIIc (8) was amplified from genomic DNA. Mutations
in five patients, in addition to those previously published, were
found (Table 2; Fig. 4a). All involved the loss or creation of
a cysteine residue. One of them, Cys342Phe, represents a
newly reported mutation and three others (one observed twice)
have been previously reported. Of these, one also involves
mutation of the critical cysteine (Cys342Tyr) and the other
two disturb the S-S cross-linking in a different way, by
creating a new cysteine residue (Ser347Cys and Ser354Cys).
Cys342Phe destroys a BsaAl site. The Cys342Tyr mutation,

which creates an Rsal site, was confirmed by Rsal digestion.
In total, of the 40 Crouzon patients analysed, 14 have been
found to have a mutation in this exon (this paper and ref. 5).
DISCUSSION
Crouzon syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder of
craniofacial development, characterized clinically by an abnormal skull shape and prominent eyes. Changes in the hands
and/or toes are not observed (20,21). The underlying physical
cause is premature fusion of the cranial sutures or craniosynostosis. The consequence may be raised pressure on the
developing brain requiring surgical intervention. With planned
surgery a much improved facial appearance is achieved and
normal intellectual development generally follows.

A gene for Crouzon syndrome was mapped to the long arm
of chromosome 10 by genetic linkage (12) and although few
large families have been studied no evidence for genetic
heterogeneity has been found (13). In view of the chromosomal
localisation of Crouzon syndrome, FGFR2 was tested as a
candidate gene and mutations in this gene in Crouzon patients
were demonstrated (5). Two forms of FGFR2, which vary in
a 48 or 49 amino acid sequence covering the second half of
the third immunoglobulin loop in the extracellular region, are
expressed in the embryo from early postimplantation until

advanced organogenesis (10). However, the two alternatively
spliced forms showed distinct patterns of spatial expression
(11). The form using the Illb exon, which is also called
keratinocyte growth factor receptor because of its specific
binding to FGF7 or keratinocyte growth factor, is expressed
mainly in epithelia and was predicted to have a particular part
in the formation of skin and its derivatives, while the form
using exon IIIc is preferentially expressed during osteogenesis
(11). Based on this prediction, changes were sought in exon
IIIc in patients with Crouzon syndrome. The mutations found
were believed to be causative because (i) many of them
involved the cysteine which is essential for the three-dimensional structure of the immunoglobulin-like loop; (ii) de novo
changes were found in sporadic patients; (iii) the changes
segregated with the disorder in familial cases; and (iv) no such
variants were found in normal individuals (5,6). In the initial
study (5) mutations were found only in nine of 20 patients
studied.

Patients with Pfeiffer syndrome have similar craniofacial
changes to those with Crouzon syndrome but additionally have
characteristic broad thumbs and toes (20-22). A gene for
Pfeiffer syndrome was mapped to the pericentromeric region
of chromosome 8, in some but not all families, in a linkage
study (14) and, in view of the findings in Crouzon syndrome,
the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene (FGFRl), which
also maps to that region of chromosome 8, was regarded as a
candidate. In contrast to the situation in Crouzon syndrome,
there is a common mutation in the Pfeiffer families of a proline
to arginine substitution located in exon IIIu, upstream of the
cysteine residue involved in S-S binding, in the region linking
immunoglobulin-like loops II and III (7). The FGFRl gene
has a similar structural organization to the FGFR2 gene with
alternative exons for the second half of immunoglobulin-like
loop III (1) and so the Pfeiffer mutation would be expressed
in all transcripts from the FGFRl gene locus.

Although, including this work, there are now 14 described
mutations in the third immunoglobulin-like loop which cause
the Crouzon syndrome, the distribution is clearly not random
as four different mutations account for 16 cases. None of the
mutations corresponds to a CpG to TpG change, which has
been well documented as having a high frequency and,
therefore, the non-random distribution is likely to reflect the
phenotypic consequence of the change rather than be an
indirect consequence of mutation rate. The recurrent mutation
at a specific nucleotide in FGFR3 in achondroplasia occurs

with an estimated frequency of between 1 per 15 000 and 1
per 40 000. This represents a remarkably high mutation rate.
However, the nucleotide involved is indeed a G to A transition
(corresponding to CpG to TpG in the antisense strand).
There is some overall pattern in the range of mutations
found in Crouzon syndrome patients (5,6, this work). The
majority disrupt the intrachain disulphide bonding typical of
immunoglobulin-like domains by mutations of either of the
two cysteines, one from each exon, or by creation of a new
cysteine. The disulphide bond stabilizes the whole structure
by increasing hydrophobic interactions between amino acid
residues inside the immunoglobulin fold. If the S-S bridges
are removed or reformed a major conformational change
of the secondary structure would be expected. The formal
requirement for cysteine residues for the ligand binding activity
of FGFR was shown by site-directed mutagenesis of each of
the cysteines in FGFR1 (19). In addition the creation of free
sulphydryl groups could allow aberrant disulphide bonding
with other mutant FGFR2 molecules. This might lead to
constitutive activation of the mutant homodimer, a mechanism
that has previously been described for erythropoietin, epidermal
growth factor and RET receptors (24-26).
Two other recurrent mutations, Tyr340His and Trp29OArg,
also occur at particularly highly conserved positions of both
the FGFR family and the more extended family of immunoglobulin-like loops (18). This again suggests that they have a
major part in preserving the structure. The difference in
phenotypes between the Crouzon and Apert syndromes may
be attributed to mutations which significantly disrupt the
secondary structure and function of the FGFR2 molecule
resulting in the Crouzon syndrome whereas specific mutations
subtly affecting receptor function cause the Apert syndrome.
There remain a number of patients with Crouzon syndrome,
all of whom have been fully clinically assessed, in which we
have found no mutation in exon IIIu or exon Me. No SSCP
changes have been found in exon Mb (unpublished results)
and there remains the possibility that these cases may be
caused by mutations elsewhere in FGFR2, in FGFR1 or even
in one of the ligands for FGFR2, such as FGF1, 2 or 4.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Exon IIIu analysis
Sequences from exon IIIu were either obtained from cDNA using published
methods (8) or from genomic DNA. Primers for PCR amplification of the
exon from genomic DNA were designed, using PRIMER program (Version
5.0) from the extreme 5' end of the sequence and from the downstream intron.
Forward: 5'-GAGCGATCGCCTCACC-3' Reverse: 5'-TGTGGGTACCTTTAGATTCAGAAAG-3'. The reverse primer was biotinylated at the 5' end
and the sequencing carried out using magnetic streptavidin coated beads
(Dynal UK). SSCP analysis was carried out as previously described (5,8).
Restriction enzyme digestion
PCR products from exon IIIu were digested with Bbs\ (New England Biolabs),
Bsfl. (New England Biolabs), Bsall (New England Biolabs) or Mnh (New
England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the resulting
product separated on a 2% agarose or 4.5% Metaphor (Flowgen) gel. PCR
products from exon IIIc were digested with BsaAl (New England Biolabs)
and separated on a 2% agarose gel.
Exon IIIc analysis
SSCP and DNA sequencing was carried out as previously described (5).

synostosis but with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet
(20,21). Owing to the severity of the condition, large families
suitable for linkage studies do not exist, but it was possible to
analyse a number of small families in an exclusion analysis
of the loci for the fibroblast growth factor receptor genes 1, 2
and 3 (8) which predicted that FGFR2 was again the most
likely candidate. All 40 cases of Apert syndrome analysed
showed missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino
acids, either serine 252 to tryptophan or proline 253 to arginine
(8). This second mutation is exactly equivalent, in position
and sequence, to the Pfeiffer causing mutation on chromosome
8 and would, therefore, also be expressed in both isoforms of
the gene.
In view of these results, exon IIIu of FGFR2, which encodes
the first half of the Iglll domain, was screened, initially by
SSCP, for mutations causing Crouzon syndrome. We report
here five such mutations in 11 unrelated individuals. The
evidence that these changes are disease causing follows that
given above for the mutations in exon Me. They are nonconservative and in five cases involve the cysteine involved
in S-S binding, several were observed de novo and no such
changes have been observed in at least 200 individuals without
craniosynostosis.
Correlation of the phenotype and genotype poses a fascinating problem in the case of FGFRs. In addition to the results
just discussed it has been shown that mutations in FGFR2,
exon Me, can also cause Pfeiffer syndrome (9), presumably
explaining at least some and maybe all of the genetic heterogeneity observed by Robin et al. (14). Surprisingly, two of the
mutations described, both involving Cys342, are identical to
mutations described in the Crouzon syndrome and three
additional mutations have been found including a splice site
mutation (9,15). A further missense mutation in exon Me,
Alanine 344 to Glycine, causes Jackson-Weiss syndrome in a
single family. The findings to date are summarized in Fig. 5.
It was impossible to distinguish clinically between the cases
of Crouzon syndrome arising from exon Me mutations and
those arising from exon IIIu mutations. Therefore, apparently
the phenotype arises from disruption of the Me exon form of
FGFR2 with little additional contribution from KGFR (Mb).
Conversely, it seems that KGFR mutant molecules may not
result in an abnormal phenotype in the heterozygous state. It
also remains unknown why mutations in a position in the
molecule which will affect both forms should have such a
limited effect on the phenotype. Fibroblast growth factor
receptors interact with the growth factors via a heparin complex
(16,17) and their action in vivo will be modulated by cellular
proteoglycans. The Igll-IgM regions of the molecules are
involved in this interaction (17). It is possible that the clinical
effects reflect to some extent the exact proteoglycan content
at the site of the sutures or in the digits.
