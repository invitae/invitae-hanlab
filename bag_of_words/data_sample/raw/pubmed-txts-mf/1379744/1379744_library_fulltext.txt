of this process in the regulation of transmembrane receptor function. Ubiquitination may
serve as a means to down-regulate receptors by
targeting them for degradation, or, like phosphorylation, it may affect function by altering
signal transducing properties and associations
of modified receptors.
Note added in proof: Ligand-induced
changes in the ubiquitination of the receptor for PDGF have recently been described

The Skeletal Muscle Chloride Channel in Dominant
and Recessive Human Myotonia
Manuela C. Koch, Klaus Steinmeyer, Claudius Lorenz,

Autosomal recessive generalized myotonia (Becker's disease) (GM) and autosomal dominant
myotonia congenita (Thomsen's disease) (MC) are characterized by skeletal muscle stiffness
that is a result of muscle membrane hyperexcitability. For both diseases, alterations in muscle
chloride or sodium currents or both have been observed. A complementary DNA for a human
skeletal muscle chloride channel (CLC1) was cloned, physically localized on chromosome 7,
and linked to the T cell receptor p (TCRB) locus. Tight linkage of these two loci to GM and MC
was found in German families. An unusual restriction site in the CLC-1 locus in two GM families
identified a mutation associated with that disease, a phenylalanine-to-cysteine substitution in
putative transmembrane domain D8. This suggests that different mutations in CLC-1 may
cause dominant or recessive myotonia.

Autosomal recessive generalized myotonia
(GM) is a nondystrophic disorder of skeletal muscle and was clinically separated (1)
from autosomal dominant myotonia congenita (MC) (1, 2). In GM, myotonic
stiffness starts in early childhood in the legs.
It progresses for some years, affecting the
arms, neck, and facial muscles. After the
patient reaches approximately 20 years of
age, the disease remains unchanged. In

most patients, muscle stiffness is associated
with transient weakness after rest. In MC,
complaints are similar but more benign.
Muscle stiffness caused by these diseases
is a result of repetitive firing of muscle fiber
action potentials (myotonic runs) (3). Two
mechanisms have been proposed to cause
the underlying intrinsic muscle hyperexcitability: (i) a decrease in muscle chloride
conductance, as found in several human

which demonstrates that ; was ubiquitinated.
Unmodified ; (16 kD) was not recognized by
the anti-ubiquitin reagents.
The presence of additional activation-dependent species on ubiquitin blots (Fig. 3, A
and B) suggested the possibility that other
TCR components were ubiquitinated. Immunoprecipitated TCRs were resolved on lower
percentage polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin (Fig. 4, A and B).
Spots that varied in pI and migrated at 34 and
42 kD (Fig. 4B) were suggestive of ubiquitination of the 26-kD CD3 8 subunit, which
exhibits heterogeneity in pI as a result of
variable modifications with sialic acid. A duplicate immunoblot from activated cells was
probed with a polyclonal antiserum to CD3 8
(18). In addition to the 26-kD 8, two sets of
larger molecular size forms were seen (Fig.
4C) that comigrated with the species detected
by anti-ubiquitin (Fig. 4B). These larger forms
of 8 were detected only in activated cells (Fig.
5A). The presence of charge heterogeneity for
ubiquitinated 8 indicated that these subunits
contained sialic acid and therefore had traversed the intermediate Golgi apparatus.
The finding of relatively acidic species,
including a 27-kD form above 21-kD phosphorylated 4 (Fig. 1D) (10), indicated that
ubiquitinated forms of phosphorylated C also
exist. To confirm this, we incubated immunoprecipitates from activated and unactivated
cells with alkaline phosphatase before electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5B). This resulted in the loss of phosphorylated 4 (21 kD)
as well as the loss of the 27-kD species. Thus,
it is apparent that this 27-kD form was ubiquitinated phosphorylated ;.
We estimate that approximately 10% of
TCR-associated 4 is ubiquitinated upon activation. On the basis of the distribution of
heterodimers on diagonal gels, it would appear that ubiquitinated ; chains are more
likely to be dimerized to other ubiquitinated ;
molecules than to 16-kD ;. These proteins
exist primarily as components of assembled
receptors (Fig. 2) (10), and their appearance
is not a result of redistribution from a detergent insoluble pool (10). Human T cells also
demonstrate the same activation-induced
forms of ubiquitinated ; (10).
In 2B4 cells, both ubiquitinated 4 and
phosphorylated 4 appear within 5 min of
stimulation and persist for at least 2 hours
(10). A dichotomy is apparent in freshly
isolated normal splenocytes where ubiquitination of ; increases markedly with receptor
engagement, whereas tyrosine phosphorylated
; is present at maximal levels without stimulation. This may be a result of the in vivo
signals that regulate these processes. Alternatively, it may be a manifestation of differences
in the half-lives of these modifications or of
the receptors that are altered. The activationinduced ubiquitination of the TCR suggests
the possibility of a more generalized function

= 2.53 at 0 = 0.0). Combined linkage
analysis of GM to both loci resulted in a
maximum multipoint lod score of z = 5.79
at 0 = 0.0 (Table 1).
In addition, for two of the clinically
typical GM families, a rare Nsi I pattern
was detected with the CLC-1 probe. In
pedigree 4003 (Fig. 2), the consanguineous
parents show this unusual Nsi I pattern
(A3). They both lack the = 17-kb fragment
of allele A2, which is replaced by % 10- and
=7-kb fragments as a result of the additional Nsi I site. The three affected sons are
homozygous for this site. In one other

family, only the father was a carrier for A3
and transmitted it to all three affected
offspring (19). Because this unusual Nsi I
site was not observed in 110 control individuals, this suggests that it may be generated directly by the disease-causing mutation. We identified this mutation using
restriction by Nsi I to search for it in
genomic CLC- 1 clones isolated from libraries constructed from an unaffected individual and from a GM patient homozygous for
this site (one of the affected brothers of

pedigree 4003) (Fig. 2) (20). Sequencing
revealed a T-to-G exchange in exonic sequence (Fig. 3A), leading to the Nsi I site

muscle fibers analyzed electrophysiologically in vitro (4-6) and (ii) alterations of
sodium channel activity. In support of the
first, a genetic defect in the skeletal muscle
Cl- channel CLC- 1 (7) was recently found
in the recessive myotonic mouse mutant
ADR (8). Because Cl- conductance accounts for about 80% of normal resting
muscle membrane conductance (9), its decrease [or pharmacological blockage (3, 9)]
leads to a slower rate of repolarization after
action potentials and to myotonic runs.
Alterations of Na' channel activity, especially late openings, were observed in a
large proportion of biopsies from GM patients (4, 10) and especially in biopsies
from MC patients (11). Related findings
were made with other disorders with the
symptom myotonia, such as myotonic dystrophy (10, 12) and Schwarz-Jampel syndrome (13).
By homology screening with the major
rat skeletal muscle chloride channel CLC-1
(7), we cloned a partial human CLC-1
cDNA that covers about 80% of the coding
sequence (14). This region is 88% identical
to the rat channel in amino acids (14).
CLC-1 was then physically localized by
somatic cell hybrids to the chromosomal
region 7q32-qter (Fig. 1) and used to search
for restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in ten unrelated individuals. Among 25 enzymes tested, diallelic Nsi
I and Ava II RFLPs were revealed (15) and
subsequently used in five reference pedigrees to prove linkage to the T cell receptor
P3 (TCRB) locus (16) on chromosome 7q.
Tight linkage with no recombinants was
shown for CLC-1/Nsi I versus CLC-1/Ava
II with a lod (logarithm of odds) score (17)
of z = 3.62 at a recombination fraction of 0
= 0.0 and for TCRB versus the combined
CLC-1 haplotype of z = 5.23 at 0 = 0.0
(Table 1). The fact that the CLC-1 locus
was previously linked to the TCRB locus in
mice (8) supports the mouse-human homology map for this chromosomal region on
human chromosome 7q and mouse chromosome 6.
Both human gene probes, CLC-1 and
TCRB, were used to test the members of
seven GM families (18). Linkage was
shown to the CLC-1 haplotype (z = 4.69 at

Recent reports have stressed the effects of
altered Na+ channel kinetics (1 1) in MC.
These kinetic effects are likely to be secondary, especially because similar observations
were made in myotonic dystrophy (10, 12),
where the defective gene has been mapped
to chromosome 19 (21) and whose gene
product is probably a protein kinase (22).
Thus, our data suggest that mutations in
the muscle Cl- channel can cause myotonia with either a recessive or a dominant
mode of inheritance. A recessive form is
easily explained by a total loss of function.
This has been described in ADR mice (8),
which we now show to be an excellent
model system for human myotonia. On the
other hand, a mutation acting dominantly
could possibly be explained by a homomultimeric structure of the channel [the multimeric state of channels of this family is
currently unknown (7, 23, 24)]. In this
model, the channel subunit encoded by the
mutated gene associates with and inactivates the functional subunits encoded by
the normal allele. Such a situation was
found with transgenic Drosophila that expresses a mutant Shaker K' channel (25).
This model may also fit with the observation that the clinical phenotype is often less
severe in MC than in GM patients (1) and
that electrophysiological evidence for re-

duced Cl- conductance was weaker in MC
(11); possibly, some of the channel complexes escape inactivation by the mutated
subunit. Thus, our work also indirectly
suggests a multimeric structure of CLC-1
Cl- channels.

14. A 32P-labeled rat CLC-1 cDNA (7), extending
from bp 970 to bp 1881, was used to screen a
human skeletal muscle cDNA library in XZAPII
(Stratagene) at moderately high stringency (45%
formamide, x5 saline sodium citrate, x5 Denhardt's, and 0.1% SDS at 42°C). A single positive
clone was identified and subcloned by in vivo
excision. Sequencing revealed that it begins at bp
510 relative to the rat channel and extends into
the 3' noncoding region (total length = 2517 bp)
(K. Steinmeyer, C. Lorenz, T. J. Jentsch, in preparation). The sequence has been deposited in the
European Molecular Biology Laboratory/GenBank
database (accession number M97820). Comparison to the rat CLC-1 sequence by the AALIGN
program (DNASTAR) revealed that it is 88% homologous to that channel.

unrelated Caucasians) were Al > 30 kb (0.6) and

and to a predicted Phe-to-Cys exchange.
This Phe, located toward the end of putative membrane span D8, is highly conserved among different members of the voltage-gated Cl- channel family and thus is
probably important for channel function
(Fig. 3B). The propensity of the new Cys to
form improper disulfide bonds may be involved in the pathogenic effect of this
mutation.
Thus, there is strong evidence that GM
is caused by defects in the skeletal muscle
Cl- channel CLC-1. Definitive proof that
the Phe-to-Cys mutation really causes the
disease will have to await the functional
expression of the mutated channel. Because
this mutation is present in only a proportion of affected GM individuals, there is
probably heterogeneity in CLC-1 mutations
that cause GM.
Having shown close linkage of CLC- 1 to
the disorder GM and having identified a
GM-associated mutation, we tested the
members of four MC families (18) for the
same linkage hypothesis (Fig. 4). The MC
data resulted in a maximum multipoint lod
score of z = 4.58 at 0 = 0.0 (12 scorable
meioses) (Table 1), which suggests that
CLC-1 is also involved in this dominant
disease. Definitive proof will require the
identification of CLC-1 mutations in MC.

Hypovirulence of Chestnut Blight Fungus
Conferred by an Infectious Viral cDNA
Gil H. Choi and Donald L. Nuss*
Strains of the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica that contain viral doublestranded RNAs often exhibit reduced virulence. Such hypovirulent strains act as biocontrol
agents by virtue of their ability to convert virulent strains to hypovirulence after anastomosis. Transformation of virulent C. parasitica strains with a full-length complementary
DNA copy of a hypovirulence-associated viral RNA conferred the complete hypovirulence
phenotype. Cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA was resurrected from the chromosomally
integrated complementary DNA copy and was able to convert compatible virulent strains
to hypovirulence. These results establish viral double-stranded RNA as the causal agent
of hypovirulence and demonstrate the feasibility of engineering hypovirulent fungal strains.

The North American chestnut blight epidemic, initiated by the unintentional introduction of the Asian fungus Cryphonectria
(Endothia) parasitica at the turn of the century, resulted in the destruction of several
billion mature American chestnut trees (14). The potential for biological control of
chestnut blight effected by naturally occurring strains of C. parasitica that exhibit
reduced levels of virulence (hypovirulence)
has been demonstrated (5-7). Whereas virulent C. parasitica strains penetrate and
destroy bark and cambium layers and cause
wilting and death, hypovirulent strains usually produce superficial cankers that eventually heal. Hypovirulence is correlated

[American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)

fungal strains after anastomosis (physical
fusion of hyphae) provides the basis for
disease control (7).
The largest dsRNA present in hypovirulent C. parasitica strain EP713, large
dsRNA (L-dsRNA), was recently cloned
and characterized (9-12). The similarity of
the L-dsRNA genetic organization and expression strategy to those of several viral
genomes (1 1) and an apparent evolutionary
relationship to the plant potyviruses (13)
prompted the introduction of the term hypovirulence-associated virus (HAV) to denote this class of genetic elements (11).
Efforts to rigorously demonstrate HAV
dsRNAs as the causal agent of hypovirulence have been hampered by the inability
of these viral elements to initiate infection
by an extracellular route, a common property of mycoviruses and fungus-associated
unencapsidated viral-like RNAs (14-16).
We describe the construction of a fulllength cDNA clone of EP713 L-dsRNA
that, when introduced into virulent C.
parasitica strains by DNA-mediated transformation, generated a resurrected, cytoplasmically replicating dsRNA form from
the integrated cDNA copy.
One strand of L-dsRNA contains a 3'
polyadenylate [poly(A)1 tail that is basepaired to a stretch of polyuridine [poly(U)J
present at the 5' terminus of the complementary strand (17). The molecule consists
of 12,712 bp, excluding the poly(A):
poly(U) homopolymer domain and contains two large open reading frames (ORF)
within the poly(A) strand that were designated ORF A (622 codons) and ORF B
(3,165 codons) (11). To construct a fulllength cDNA clone of L-dsRNA, we first
generated several large intermediate clones
from a set of overlapping partial cDNA
clones (Fig. 1). A four-factor ligation-transformation was then performed to generate
plasmid pLDST that contained a full-length
cDNA copy of L-dsRNA inserted between
the Xba I and Hind III sites of pUC19.

recessive and for MC an autosomal dominant
inheritance with 100% penetrance were assumed
(all unaffected individuals were beyond the age of
risk). The prevalence of these two diseases was
assumed (1) to be 1:50,000 in GM and 1:23,000
in MC.
18. After receipt of informed consent, seven families
(a total of 14 affected and 13 nonaffected siblings)
with the diagnosis of GM and 4 families with MC
(20 affected, 7 nonaffected, and 7 spouses) were
studied. The age of onset for individuals with GM
was 2 to 10 years, and 1 to 18 years for MC. All
individuals in a family received a thorough neurological examination. In addition, a standardized
forearm cooling test was performed on MC individuals to exclude paramyotonia congenita [K.
Ricker et al., Arch. Neurol. 47, 268 (1990)]. For the
purpose of the study, it was assumed that GM and
MC are single-gene disorders, where variation in
symptoms probably results from different mutations in the same locus.

lymphocyte DNA from a GM patient homozygous
for the unusual Nsi site (Fig. 2), and another
genomic human library in XFIXII was purchased
(Stratagene). Phages hybridizing to human CLC-1
cDNAs were purified, and their inserts were isolated, digested with Nsi I, and subcloned into
pGem5Zf. The Nsi fragment of interest was
identified by hybridization to successively smaller
