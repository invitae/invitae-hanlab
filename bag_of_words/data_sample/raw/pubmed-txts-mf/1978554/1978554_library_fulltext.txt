Mutation May Have Originated Independently in
Europe and Asia

Summary
A polymorphic site exists in exon 11 of G6PD: in the wild-type enzyme, nucleotide (NT) 1311 is a C, but
is some individuals from diverse populations a T is present instead. Nine of 54 X chromosomes from Europeans of mixed origins, nine of 41 X chromosomes of Ashkenazi Jewish subjects, three of 18 X chromosomes of Sicilians, five of 20 African X chromosomes, and nine of 20 Asian Indian X chromosomes had
the mutant genotype. In contrast, the mutation was found in only three of 59 Oriental X chromosomes
and in three of 30 Central/South American X chromosomes. The mutation was absent from four samples
of chimpanzee DNA. Twenty-one of 22 male subjects from Mediterranean countries who had the G6PD
Mediterranean563T genotype investigated in the present study or reported previously had a T at NT 1311.
Only one had the normal C at NT 1311. In contrast, both G6PD Mediterranean563T males from the Indian
subcontinent had the normal C at NT 1311. These findings suggest that the same mutation at nucleotide
563 giving rise to G6PD Mediterranean may have arisen independently in Europe and in Asia.
Introduction
When Martini et al. (1986) and Persico et al. (1986a,
1986b) and, subsequently, Takizawa et al. (1986) and
Yoshida and Takizawa (1986) cloned and sequenced human G6PD, it was hoped that this gene, which had
played such an important role in the development of
mammalian genetics, would contain many polymorphic
sites that might prove useful in further investigations.
Unfortunately, the results of analysis with restriction
endonucleases were disappointing. An extensive search
for RFLPs by d'Urso et al. (1988) yielded only a single
mutation, a silent change of nucleotide (NT) 1116 that
destroys a PstI site in 22% of Nigerians. However, another mutation, creating a PvuII site in intron 5 was
found by Yoshida et al. (1988 ) and recently was studied
in a larger population by Fey et al. (1990). These mutations, found thus far only among African populations,

have proved to be useful and have provided evidence
that G6PD A- 202A1376G could have arisen only once,
since all cases that have been examined, from all populations, are found in the same PstI and PvuII haplotype
(Beutler and Kuhl 1990).
The studies of De Vita et al. (1989) in Sardinia have
suggested that still another polymorphism, one that
does not give rise to a restriction site, may exist. These
investigators found that in all patients with the NT 563
COT mutation that is characteristic of G6PD Mediterranean (Vulliamy et al. 1988) a second mutation, a silent C-O'T transition at NT 1311 was present. More recently, we have found the same mutation in the DNA
of all five patients whom we have examined with G6PD
Mediterranean (Vives-Corrons et al. 1990). We have
now investigated the distribution of this mutation in
patients with and without G6PD deficiency, and we have
concluded that it represents a relatively common polymorphism. Its existence in the vast majority of European subjects with G6PD Mediterranean suggests that
this mutation may have arisen only once in the Mediterranean basin, but its absence from Indian-subcontinent subjects with G6PD Mediterranean suggests that
it occurred independently there.

a Although given a designation other than Mediterranean, on the basis of biochemical characterization, these variants should probably
be simply regarded as G6PD Mediterranean on the basis of sequence analysis.
b Confirmed by using DNA provided by Dr. G. Martini.

Material and Methods
Subjects Examined

By the use of the MboII restriction endonuclease,
DNA from 15 unrelated males with G6PD deficiency
was examined for the NT 563 C-OT mutation that is
characteristic of G6PD Mediterranean. Ten were found
to have this mutation. The ethnic origin of these subjects is summarized in table 1.

Eighty-eight additional unrelated males and 90 unrelated females of various ethnic origins not known to
be G6PD deficient were examined. Their ethnic origin is summarized in table 2. In addition, the DNA
of four chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) was examined.

the restriction enzyme, and electrophoresis have been
described elsewhere (Vives-Corrons et al. 1990).
Detection of the G6PD C-T Mutation at NT 1311
Because the mutation at NT 1311 does not produce
or destroy a restriction site, the identity of the NT at
this position was initially determined by sequence analysis of exon 11. Single-stranded DNA containing this
exon was produced in two stages by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
The PCR reaction contained 34 mM Tris-HC1 pH
8.8, 8.3 mM ammonium sulfate, 3.4 mM MgCl2, 85
ig BSA/ml, 0.5 mM of each dNTP, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, 1 gg genomic DNA, 5 units Taq polymerase,
and 50 ng each of the oligonucleotides 5'-ACTCCACATGGTGCAGGCAG and 3Y-TAACTGGAGTCGACGTGTAA. After 15 cycles consisting of 30 s at 921C,
30 s at 580C, and 30 s at 720C, 300 ng of a nested
oligonucleotide of the sequence 5'-TGGCATCAGCAAGACACTCT was added for an additional 35 cycles.
After phenol/chloroform extraction, chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation (Maniatis et al. 1982),
the PCR DNA was purified by spin dialysis and was
sequenced using a commercially available Taq polymerase sequencing kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The
sequencing oligonucleotide 3'-GGACGTATGGACACCCGATA was radiolabeled with y-32P-ATP and polynucleotide kinase (Maniatis et al. 1982).
In order to screen larger numbers of samples the technique of allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization
was used. One microgram of genomic DNA was amplified by the PCR to obtain a 148-bp fragment of DNA
containing exon 11 by using 5'-TGGCATCAGCAAGACACTCT and 3'-GGACGTATGGACACCCGATA as
primers. Thirty cycles of amplification were carried out
by using 250 ng of each oligonucleotide in a 100-gl
system containing 34 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.8, 8.3 mM
ammonium sulfate, 3.4 mM MgCl2, 85 ig BSA/ml,
0.5 mM of each dNTP, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 3
units Taq polymerase. The reaction mixture was extracted with phenol/chloroform and was ethanol precipitated (Maniatis et al. 1982). DNA was recovered
by centrifugation, lyophilization, and redissolving the
precipitate in 30-50 gl of water. Two microliters of the
amplified DNA was spotted on two wetted nitrocellulose membranes, along with a normal sample and a
mutant sample. The membranes were soaked for 2 min
in 1.5 M NaCl and 0.5 M NaOH, for 5 min in 1.5
M NaCl and O.S M Tris pH 8.0, and for 30 s in 0.2
M Tris pH 7.5 and 2 x SSC (Maniatis et al. 1982).
They were then dried in a vacuum oven at 800C for

45 min. Oligonucleotides matching the normal (5'AGGCGCTCGTAGGCGTC) and mutant (5'-AGGCGCTCATAGGCGTC) sequence, with the mutation site
in the center, were radioactively labeled with polynudeotide kinase and y-32P-ATP (Maniatis et al. 1982). The
nitrocellulose papers were incubated in a heat-sealed
bag with Pre-Hyb solution (6 x SSC, 5 x Denhardt's
solution, 0.02 M sodium phosphate pH 7, 0.5 mg
salmon sperm DNA/ml, and 1% SDS) for 30-60 min.
The Pre-Hyb was removed, and 1.5 ml of Hyb solution
(7 x SSC, 0.02 M sodium phosphate, pH 7, 0.5 mg
salmon sperm DNA/ml, and 1% SDS) containing 10
x 106 cpm of labeled oligonucleotide was added, and
the mixture was resealed and allowed to hybridize overnight at 420C. The membranes were then washed with
6 x SSC and 0.1% SDS, beginning 100C below the
calculated melting temperature of 560C (mutant) and
58°C (normal), raising the temperature, and monitoring with a Geiger counter until the negative control
DNA spots for each oligonucleotide were no longer radioactive, but the positive DNA spots still gave a good
signal. The membranes were dried and subjected to ra-

dioautography.
Results

Detection of the 1311 Mutation
As shown in figure 1, the C-*T transition at NT 1311
could readily be detected by sequence analysis of DNA
amplified directly from genomic DNA by PCR. Not

only could male hemizygotes for the wild type (C) and
the mutant type (T) be distinguished readily, but female heterozygotes were easily detected. The same
results could be obtained with less effort by using allelespecific oligonucleotide hybridization, as shown in
figure 2.

G6PD MediterraneanS63T
Table 1 presents the result of screening of males from
various ethnic origins whose DNA had been found to
manifest the NT 563 C--T transition that is typical
of G6PD Mediterranean. Also shown are the results
that others obtained in the sequencing of Italian and

Sardinian G6PD-deficient samples.

Figure I
Detection of C-IT mutation at NT 1311 by sequence analysis. Because the sequence is that of the antisense strand, a G
is found in normals and an A is found in the mutant. NT 1311 is surrounded by a dotted line. Only normal alleles were detected in samples
1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9. Samples 3, 5, and 8 are from heterozygous females. The appearance of the mutant hemizygote is shown in the right-most panel.

Both males and females were screened, and the results
are therefore expressed as the number of X chromosomes with T at NT 1311. The G6PD status of many
of these samples was unknown, and therefore no effort
was made to exclude G6PD-deficient samples; however,
since the incidence of the G6PD deficiency was less than
20% in all of these populations the bias introduced
by including G6PD-deficient samples would not be very
great.
G6PD Activity

The mean ± 1 SD G6PD activity of the red cells
of 17 normal males with the 1311C genotype was found
to be 13.64 ± 0.96 IU/gHb. The mean + 1 SD activity

Discussion

Previously reported nondeficiency polymorphisms in
the G6PD gene appear to be limited to African populations (D'Urso et al. 1988; Fey et al. 1990). It is evident
that NT 1311 of the G6PD cDNA is the site of a polymorphism that is more broadly represented in human
populations. Similar frequencies were found in northern Europeans, Mediterranean populations, and Africans. Among Asian Indians almost one-half of the X
chromosomes studied had a T at NT 1311. In contrast,
the mutation was uncommon among X chromosomes
of Orientals. The relatively low number of 1311T genes
found in the Central/South American population,
largely consisting of Mexicans, may reflect the Oriental origin of the American Indian.
The existence of a mutation at NT 1311 was first
found when DNA from subjects with G6PD Mediterranean were sequenced (De Vita et al. 1989). This silent mutation was found in addition to the mutation
at NT 563. Both examination of eight additional samples from persons of Mediterranean origin who have
the mutation at NT 563 and review of 14 cases reported
earlier have revealed that all but one of these (Vulliamy
et al. 1988) have the mutation at NT 1311 in addition.
In contrast, both subjects from the Indian subcontinent who had the mutation at NT 563 (one of them
had been reported earlier under the name "G6PD Birmingham" [Prchal et al. 1980]) had the normal C at
NT 1311. These findings suggest that the mutation that
causes G6PD Mediterranean may have occurred independently in Asia and in Europe. The single exception among 22 subjects to the linkage of 563T and 1311T
could represent the result of either a crossover or population admixture.
