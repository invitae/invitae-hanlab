The molecular defect in a 24-year-old white female
with severe type I11 hyperlipoproteinemia has been
elucidated. The patient’s apolipoprotein (apo) E migrated in the apoE-4 position on isoelectric focusing
gels. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis the apoE-4 variant had a smaller apparent molecular weight than apoE-4(Cys1” + Arg).
Sequence analysis of DNA amplified with the polymerase chain reaction revealed two nucleotide substitutions in the proband’s apoE gene. A C to T mutation
converted arginine (CGT)at position 145 of the mature
protein to cysteine (TGT) thus creating the apoE-2*
variant. A second G to A substitution at amino acid 13
led to the exchange of lysine (AAG) for glutamic acid
(GAG), thereby adding 2 positive charge units to the
protein and producing the apoE-5 variant. Computer

G to A mutation in exon 3 resulted in the loss of an
A m 1 restriction enzyme site. The second mutation, a C
to T substitution in the fourth exon of the apoE gene,
eliminated a cleavage site for the enzyme BbuI. Using
these restriction fragment length polymorphisms as
well as DNA sequence analysis we have demonstrated
that the patient is homozygous for both point mutations
in the apoE gene.

Apolipoprotein E is a 299-amino acid glycoprotein with a
molecular weight of 34,200 (1; for review see Refs. 2-5). It is
synthesized primarily in the liver (6) aspreapoE, which contains an 18-amino acid signal peptide (7). After cotranslational cleavage of the prepeptide, the mature apolipoprotein
is secreted asaprotein
constituent of newly synthesized
VLDL’ (8, 9). In plasma, apoE associates with intestinally
derived chylomicrons and is also found in a subclass of HDL
(10; for reviewseeRef.
11). ApoE modulates the in vivo
catabolism of the lipoprotein particles by binding to LDL
(apoB,E) receptors (12) and putative apoE receptors (13, 14),

which initiates cellular uptake of the apoE-containing lipoproteins.
Genetic polymorphism of apoE has been demonstrated by
isoelectric focusing and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
(15, 16). Three common isoproteins(apoE-2,apoE-3, and
apoE-4) as well as several rare variants have been described
(1, 7,17-29). This heterogeneity of apoE is the result of
multiple apoE alleles at a single genetic locus (16, 30), differing from each other by nucleotide substitutions in the protein
coding sequences of the apoE gene. In a unique apoE variant,
an insertion of seven amino acids caused by the duplication
of residues 120-126 or 121-127 has been reported (31,32).
Several of the apoE variants show decreased binding to the
LDL (apoB,E) receptor when compared with the most common apoE-3 isoprotein (18-22,25,31,33,34). Impaired receptor binding is thought tobe a prerequisite for the development
of type 111 hyperlipoproteinemia, which is characterized by
increased plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels and the
presence of cholesterol and apoE-enriched VLDL and chylomicron remnants (for review see Refs. 2-5, 35-37). Homozygosity for the most frequent apoE-2(ArglS8+ Cys) variant
with less than 2% receptor binding activity (33) is, however,
usually not sufficient to cause hyperlipidemia, and environmental, hormonal, as well as other genetic factors appear to
be involved in the manifestation of this disease (38). Type 111
hyperlipoproteinemia has also been observed in two kindreds
with apoE deficiency because of the complete absence of the
protein (3, 39, 40) or the presence of a truncated apoE (41).
In this report we describe a new variant of apoE, apoE4philadeIphia (GluI3 -+ L y ~ , A r g ’ ~ Cys)
~
associated with severe
type 111 hyperlipoproteinemia, identified ina 24-year-old
white female who is homozygous for two rare point mutations
in the apoE gene.

MATERIALSANDMETHODS

Study Subject-The patient was a 24-year-old white female with
an apoE-4/4 phenotype whowasreferred
to the NIH because of
hyperlipidemia and xanthomas, first noted atage 22.
Plasma Lipoprotein Characterization-Na,EDTA
anticoagulated
blood was obtained after a 12-h fast. Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride values were determined by automated enzymic techniques on
an Abbott VPSS analyzer (Abbott Laboratories, North
Chicago, IL).
HDL cholesterol was quantitated by dextran-sulfate precipitation of
plasma (42), and VLDL and LDL cholesterol levels were calculated
(43). The apoE phenotype was determined by one-dimensional isoelectric focusing (44) followed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal
human apoE antibody. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis was performed as described previously (45).
DNA Isolation-High molecularweight chromosomal DNA was
isolated from leukocytes using an automated nucleic acid extractor
(Applied Biosystems, Inc., model 340A).
Oligonucleotides-Synthetic oligonucleotide primers based on the
published apoE genesequence (46, 47) were prepared onaDNA

synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., model 380B) using the phosphoramidite method. Each primer contained an incorporated restriction enzyme site for EcoRI or HindIII for subcloning into sequencing
vectors M13mp18and mp19. Oligonucleotides were desalted on NAP5 columns (Pharmacia LKBBiotechnology Inc.) and used for amplification without furtherpurification.
DNA Amplification by the Polymerase Chain Reaction-One pg of
genomic DNA from the patient and froma controlsubject were
amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (48) using an automated
DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer Cetus Instruments) and1 pg of
each of two apoE-specific primers. Amplification of the third exon
was performed in a reaction mixture of 50 mM KCI; 10 mM Tris-HCI,
p H 8.3; 1.5 mM MgCI?; and 200 p~ each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and
dTTP with5 units of Taq DNApolymerase (Bethesda Research
Laboratories). The fourth exon of apoE was amplified as outlined
above with the reaction buffer supplemented with 5% (v/v) dimethyl
sulfoxide. The cycle profile included denaturation a t 95 "C for 45 s,
annealing at 62 "C for 1 min, and polymerization a t 72 "C for 1 min
for 30 cycles.
DNA Sequence Analysis-Amplified DNA was digested with the
restriction enzymes HindIII and EcoRI (Bethesda Research Laboratories andNew England BioLabs) under the conditions
recommended
by the manufacturers and subjected to electrophoresis on 1.5% low
melting pointagarose (Bethesda Research Laboratories) gels. Restriction fragments were isolated and ligated into M13 vectors mp18 and
mp19 (49;New England BioLabs). Sequencing was performed with
T 7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase; United States Biochemical Corp.)
using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method(50).
Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis-Amplified
DNA spanning the third exon and the
5'-end of exon 4 was digested
with 10 units of therestrictionenzyme AuaI and 1 unit of the
restriction enzyme BbuI for 1 h and 2 h, respectively, a t 37 "C, under
the conditions outlined
by the supplier (New England
BioLabs). AuaI
digests were separated on a 1.5% agarose (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME)minigel, and BbuI-digested fragments were electrophoresed
on a 2% agarose minigel supplemented with 1%low melting point
agarose a t 27 mA for 3-4 h. DNA was stained with ethidiumbromide.

DISCUSSION

Characterization of the Subject-The proband was a 24year-old white female of hispanic origin, born in Puerto Rico,
whose xanthomas were first noticed at age 22. The patient
presented with the clinical features of type I11 hyperlipoproteinemia including palmar xanthomas, and, even more pronounced, xanthomas of the wrists as well as tuberoeruptive
xanthomas on the elbows, knees, and buttocks. There was no
known family history of hyperlipidemia or cardiovascular
disease. Lipid values at the time of the initial examination
(age 22) were total cholesterol, 495 mg/dl; triglycerides, 1,037
mg/dl; and HDL cholesterol, 28 mg/dl. Recent therapy included a low fat diet and lovastatin (40 mg/day). At the time
of the study described here, the patient's plasma cholesterol
and triglyceride values were 211 and 260 mg/dl, respectively.
VLDL cholesterol was 109 mg/dl; LDL cholesterol, 86 mg/dl;
and HDL cholesterol, 26 mg/dl. The VLDL cholesterol to
plasma triglycerides ratio remained elevated at 0.42 (normal
< 0.3).
The young age of onset, the severity of the clinical manifestations, and the high plasma lipid levels in combination
with an apoE-4/4 phenotype were an unusual presentation of
type I11 hyperlipoproteinemia. The disease is rarely expressed
before adulthood, presents earlier in males than in females,
and is also more often observed in men, since women appear
to be protected until after menopause. Furthermore, the isoprotein most frequently associated with type I11 hyperlipoproteinemia is apoE-2(Arg15' + Cys) which has an LDL (apoB,

E)retiephr biudiIg a f f i d y uf u d y 1-2% uf LhaL of apuE-3,
the most common E isoprotein, and a slower catabolic rate as
demonstrated by in uiuo turnover studies. Ap0E-4(Cys"~+
Arg), in contrast, is cleared more rapidly from plasma than is
apoE-3 although both isoproteins bind equally well to the
LDL (apoB,E) receptor in vitro (for review see Refs. 2-5).

Characterization of APOE-4philadelphia-The apolipoprotein E
from this subject migrated to the apoE-4 position on onedimensional isoelectric focusing gels, thus having one additional net positive charge when compared with apoE-3 (data
not shown). On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, apOE-4philndelphia
had an electrophoretic mobility faster than apoE-4(Cys1" + Arg), migrating as a single
band of apparent lower molecular weight (Fig. 1).
DNA Sequence Analysis-DNA isolated from white blood
cells of the patient andfrom a normal subject was amplified
by the polymerase chain reaction using apoE sequence-specific primers as shown in Fig. 2. The amplified products were
443 base pairs (exon 3), 368 base pairs (5'-end exon 4) and
492 base pairs(3'-end exon 4) in length. Analysis of the
protein coding sequences of the apoE genes from both subjects
revealed two rare point mutations in the patient with apoE4Philsdelphia. One was a G to A substitution at nucleotide 48 of
thethird exon, which converted glutamic acid (GAG) at
position 13 of the mature proteinto lysine (AAG; Fig.3). This
apoE-3 isoprotein (PI 5.32),
adds 2 positive charge units to the
creating the more basic apoE-5 isoprotein (PI 5.64). The
second nucleotide substitution was found in the fourth exon
of apoE, where a C at position 251 was replaced by a T (Fig.
4). In thiscase, arginine at residue 145 of the mature protein,
encoded by CGT, was changed to cysteine, encoded by TGT.
This amino acid replacement creates the slightly more acidic
apoE-2* isoprotein (PI 5.2). Both substitutions together, inherited on the same allele, result in an isoprotein focusing in
the apoE-4 position (PI 5.45).
The two mutations have been described previously as separate allelic variants and as the molecular basis for the two
isoproteins a ~ o E - 2 * ( A r g-+
' ~ ~Cys; Refs. 18, 51) and apoE5(Glu13+ Lys; Ref. 27). The only homozygote for the apoE2*(Arg'45-+ Cys) isoprotein identified thus far also had type
I11 hyperlipoproteinemia, planar and tuberous xanthomas, but
showed no clinical signs of premature cardiovascular disease
(18, 52). The two reported heterozygotes had an apoE-2/2*
