Abstract. Mutations at the hexosaminidase A ( H E X A )
gene which cause Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) have elevated
frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish and French-Canadian populations. We report a novel TSD allele in the
French-Canadian population associated with the infantile form of the disease. The mutation, a G---~A transition at the + 1 position of intron 7, abolishes the donor
splice site. Cultured human fibroblasts from a compound
heterozygote for this transition (and for a deletion mutation) produce no detectable H E X A m R N A . The intron
7 + 1 mutation occurs in the base adjacent to the site of
the adult-onset TSD mutation (G805A). In both mutations a restriction site for the endonuclease E c o R I I is
abolished. Unambiguous diagnosis, therefore, requires
allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to distinguish between these two mutant alleles. The intron 7 + 1
mutation has been detected in three unrelated families.
Obligate heterozygotes for the intron 7 ยง mutation
were born in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region of Quebec.
The most recent ancestors c o m m o n to obligate carriers
of this mutation were from the Charlevoix region of the
province of Quebec. This mutation thus has a different
geographic centre of diffusion and is probably less common than the exon 1 deletion TSD mutation in French
Canadians. Neither mutation has been detected in France,
the ancestral homeland of French Canada.

Introduction
Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by massive storage of GMz ganglioside in the neurons of the cerebral

cortex. Mutations causing TSD are alleles at the H E X A
gene locus, which encodes the a-subunit of the enzyme
hexosaminidase A (Hex A; E.C.3.2.1.52). Mutant H E X A
alleles are relatively frequent in two population groups:
Ashkenazi Jews and French Canadians. Three mutations, a 4-bp (base pair) insertion in exon 11 (Myerowitz
and Costigan 1988), a transition at the intron 12 splice
junction (Ohno and Suzuki 1988; Arpaia et al. 1988,
Myerowitz 1988), and the GS05A transition associated
with adult or chronic GMz gangliosidosis (Navon et al.
1990; Paw et al. 1989) account for over 90% of TSD alleles
( G r e b n e r and Tomczak 1991; Paw et al. 1990; TriggsRaine et al. 1990) in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.
A 7.6-kb deletion removing exon 1 and flanking sequence (Myerowitz and Hogikyan 1986, 1987) occurs
uniquely among French Canadians and is the most frequent TSD mutation in this population (Hechtman et al.
1990). The center of diffusion for the French-Canadian
deletion (FCD) mutation is the Gaspd-Bas St-Laurent
region of Quebec, which is on the south shore of the
St. Lawrence River (Fig. 1). The carrier frequency for
this gene in the two largest cities of this region, Rimouski,
Quebec and Edmunston, New Brunswick has been estimated to be 5 % - 7 % ( A n d e r m a n n et al. 1977). Candidate founders for this mutation have been identified
among the first generation of French settlers born in
Canada (De Braekeleer et al. 1992). We report the characterization of a second novel TSD mutation, which is
unique to French Canada. The new mutation is less frequent than the FCD and has a different center of diffusion.

families were previously determined to be heterozygous for the
FCD and an unknown allele. Family L (Fig. 2) was referred from
H6pital de Chicoutimi (Chicoutimi, Quebec) based on clinical
diagnosis of Tay-Sachs disease, which was confirmed by the finding of less than 5% Hex A in the proband's serum.

D N A amplification
Primer pairs and conditions used to amplify exons of the HEXA
gene were as described (Triggs-Raine et al. 1991). For amplifications of DNA for single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)
analysis, the concentration of dATP in reaction tubes was reduced
to 0.1 mM and 10 laCi of c~32pdATP (NEN, Boston, Mass., 3000
Ci/mmol) was added as radioactive tracer.

SSCP analysis
SSCP analysis was performed essentially according to Orita et al.
(1988) as modified by Triggs-Raine et al. (1991). Electrophoresis
was carried out at room temperature for 16h at 15 mA.

Subcloning and sequencing
of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products
Subclones of mutant PCR products were generated by blunt-end
ligation of phosphorylated PCR product into dephosphorylated
EcoRV-digested pBS(-) (Stratagene, San Diego, Calif.). Clones
were propagated in Escherichia coli DH5c~F'IQ. Cloning procedures were according to Maniatis et al. (1982). Nine subclones

were sequenced (four mutant, five normal) for the intron 7 mutation. Sequencing was carried out on individual clones or directly
on PCR products using ~35S dATP (subclones) or 321~end-labelect
oligonucleotides (direct) with a Sequenase kit.

Direct detection of IVS7 mutation
The intron 7 +1, G---~A mutation, as well as the adult-onset TSD
mutation (G805A) were detected in an amplified fragment containing exon 7 and flanking sequences by the loss of a restriction
site for the enzyme EcoRII. A 10-~tl aliquot of PCR product was
digested with 5 units EcoRII and subjected to electrophoresis on
8% polyacrylamide at 100 V for 5 h. For unambiguous detection of
the intron 7 mutation, allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization
was carried out using 32p end-labeled normal (TGGGGACCAGGTAAGAATG) and mutant (TGGGGACCAGATAAGAATG)
probes.

Detection of other TSD alleles
The detection of the French-Canadian deletion mutation was performed according to Kaplan et al. (1991) and the exon 11 4-bp
insertion mutation was detected according to Triggs-Raine and
Gravel (1990).

mRNA expression
The effect of the mutation on mRNA expression was assessed by
reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification (Ferre and Garduno
1989) of a (total) RNA-containing fraction prepared from cultured
skin fibroblasts of individual R-III-2 as well as from control fibroblasts. HEXA mRNA expression was monitored using total RNA
as a template for RT-PCR amplification with primers (sense)
TACAACCCTGTCACCCACAT and (antisense) CTGGATGTAGAAGGACTCCA. These primers amplify a 393-bp fragment
from normal mRNA starting at nucleotide (nt) 679. The two RNA
preparations were normalized for mRNA content by amplification
of prolidase (PEPD locus) sequences. Amplification conditions
were as in Trop et al. (1992).

Genealogical reconstruction
Procedures used for reconstruction of genealogies of obligate heterozygotes, source materials for genealogical data bases, and software used for analysis of pedigrees were essentially the same as reported previously (DeBraekeleer et al. i992).

Frequency of the intron 7 ยง

allele

Genotypes were ascertained using DNA samples, prepared from
peripheral blood leukocytes, which were obtained from 92 individuals living in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean area. Of these individuals, all from the city of Chicoutimi, 50 were randomly ascertained
as controls for other studies and the remaining 42, who lived throughout the Saguenay region, were unrelated obligate carriers for the
cystic fibrosis gene.

Results

htentification of the mutation
P C R amplification of all H E X A exons and flanking sequences followed by SSCP analysis (data not shown) of
amplification products p r o d u c e d a pattern of bands that
was identical for n o r m a l control D N A and for individual
II-2 in the D family (obligate heterozygote) and indi-

vidual III-2 in the R family (affected p r o b a n d ) except for
b a n d patterns of exon 7-containing fragments.
The sequences of exon 7-containing genomic fragments
obtained f r o m individuall III-2 in family R are shown in
Fig. 3. The mutation, a G---~A transition at the first position of intron 7, abolishes the universal d o n o r splice site
GT.

Effect on gene expression
Expression of m u t a n t H E X A m R N A was assessed in
cultured skin fibroblasts obtained from R-III-2 since the
other m u t a n t H E X A allele in this patient, the F C D
( H e c h t m a n et al. 1990), is not compatible with the expression of H E X A m R N A . No e D N A fragments were
detected when an R N A - c o n t a i n i n g fraction from patients' cells was used as a template for R T - P C R , whereas
the control cell R N A directed the amplification of a
single fragment of 393 bp. Primers for amplification of
prolidase ( P E P D gene ) p r o d u c e d c D N A fragments of
c o m p a r a b l e intensity when R N A preparations from both
normal and T S D cell lines were used as templates, indicating that m R N A p r e p a r e d f r o m patients" cell had not
u n d e r g o n e degradation.

Detection of the mutation in genornic DNA
The intron 7 +1 mutation occurs in the nucleotide adjacent to the last base in exon 7, which is the site of the
adult-onset G S 0 5 A T S D mutation. B o t h mutations result in the loss of a cleavage site for the restriction endonuclease EcoRII. A 221-bp p r o d u c t amplified from norreal genomic D N A gives digestion fragments of 153, 44,
16, and 8 bp. In the m u t a n t allele a 52-bp band replaces
the 44-bp fragment (Fig. 4). Digestion of genomic D N A
from two clinically affected individuals k n o w n to be
heterozygous for the adult T S D m u t a t i o n gives the identical pattern of restriction fragments. T h e two mutations
can be unequivocally distinguished using allele-specific
oligonucleotide hybridization as shown in Fig. 4. In family L an affected individual (II-13) had been diagnosed
clinically. P C R amplification and heteroduplex analysis

of exon 11 sequences in D N A obtained from her father
(L-I-3) showed that the exon 11 4-bp insert TSD allele
also occurs in this family. This individual is the second
such (unrelated) obligate heterozygote we have identified in French Canada (Hechtman et al. 1990).

Origin and regional frequency
of the intron 7 4-1 TSD mutation
Among 92 unrelated individuals from the Saguenay-LacSt-Jean area one heterozygote was detected using dot hybridization. Genealogical reconstruction performed on
the four obligate heterozygotes for the intron 7 + 1 mutation identified 82 common ancestors. Among these, 39
were born in Quebec (14 on C6te de Beaupr6, 13 in Charlevoix, and 12 in Quebec City). None were born in Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean. The remaining 43 common ancestors were born in Europe with 14/43 coming from the
French province of Perche. This proportion is considerably higher than the relative contribution of Perche to the
total number of settlers of Quebec during the period of
the French regime (217/8500) (Charbonneau and Robert
1987).

Discussion
A novel H E X A mutation has been identified in a population in which the frequency of Tay-Sachs disease approaches that found among Ashkenazi Jews. In neither
population can the spread of TSD alleles be attributed to
the effect of a single founder since heteroallelism is found
in both groups. The most frequent T S D mutation in
French Canada, the 7.6-kb deletion accounts for about
75% of independently segregating alleles (inherited from
individuals not more closely related than second degree
cousins) and has a center of diffusion on the south shore
of the St. Lawrence River. This allele has not been detected among 50 independently segregating TSD chromosomes in France (Akli et la. 1991). By contrast, the
exon 11 4-bp insertion mutation has been shown to occur

in two French-speaking North American populations
(Hechtman et al. 1990; McDowell et al. 1991) probably
introduced by different non-Jewish founders (P. Hechtman, unpublished).
The intron 7 + 1 mutant allele is a second instance of
a TSD mutation unique to French Canada that also has
not yet been detected in France (Akli et al. 1991). It is
unlikely that the founder came from France since in
seventeenth century rural France whole families did not,
as a rule, emigrate to New France and thus carrier sibs
who remained in Europe would have passed the gene on
to numerous descendants. Such a prediction was born
out for the 10-kb deletion hypercholesterolemia mutation (Jomphe et la. 1988; De Braekeleer et al. 1988) and
for the MIV allele at the P A H locus (De Braekeleer et al.
1990) both of which are found in Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean
and in France. Although a high proportion of ancestors
common to the heterozygotes for the intron 7 + 1 TSD
allele were from Perche this ancestry is also shared by
many individuals from the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region
who are unselected for any particular genotype (De Braekeleer et al. 1991).
The Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region is a geographic isolate. The birthplaces and dates of the common ancestors
correlate with known patterns of settlement in Quebec.
Quebec City served as the port of entry for most immigrants in the early years of the French regime. Agricultural settlements moved downriver initially to C6te de
Beaupr6 and later to Charlevoix and to Bas St-Laurent.
The Charlevoix region was the source of 75% of the emigrants to Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean in the initial phase of
white settlement (1838-1870: Gauvreau and Bourque
1988). It is, therefore, most likely that the founder was
from the Charlevoix area since (1) no common ancestors
came from Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean itself, (2) the most recent common ancestors are all from Charlevoix, and (3)
the mutation has not been detected in any other region
of Quebec. In the twentieth century industrial development in Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean brought immigrants from
other regions of Quebec including the south shore of the
St. Lawrence River. Some of these carried the deletion
