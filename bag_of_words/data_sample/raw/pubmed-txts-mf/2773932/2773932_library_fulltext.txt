Summary
In 15%-20% of children with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), the underlying defect is adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. The overall goal of our research has been to identify the precise molecular defects in patients with ADA-deficient SCID. In this study, we focused on a patient whom we found to
have normal sized ADA mRNA by Northern analysis and an intact ADA structural gene by Southern analysis. By cloning and sequencing this patient's ADA cDNA, we found a C-to-T point mutation in exon 11.
This resulted in the amino acid substitution of a valine for an alanine at position 329 of the ADA protein.
Sequence analysis revealed that this mutation created a new Banl restriction site. Using Southern analyses,
we were able to directly screen individuals to determine the frequency of this mutation. By combining data
on eight families followed at our institution with data on five other families reported in the literature, we
established that five of 13 patients (seven of 22 alleles) with known or suspected point mutations have this
defect. This mutation was found to be associated with three different ADA haplotypes. This argues against
a founder effect and suggests that the mutation is very old. In summary, a conservative amino acid substitution is found in a high proportion of patients with ADA deficiency; this can easily be detected by Southern analysis.

Introduction
Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a syndrome characterized by a profound deficiency in B- and
T-cell function (Bortin and Rimm 1977). Infants born
with this disorder die in the first few years of life unless
treated successfully by bone marrow transplantation or
kept in a sterile isolation facility (Bortin and Rimm
1977; Buckley et al. 1986). In most cases of SCID the
underlying molecular defect is unknown. In 15% of
the patients, however, a deficiency of the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA; E.C.3.5.4.4) is found (Kredich
and Hershfield 1983; Buckley et al. 1986) and is thought
to be responsible for their immunodeficiency (Giblett
et al. 1972).

In recent years the normal ADA cDNA (Orkin et al.
1983; Valerio et al. 1983; Wiginton et al. 1983) and
normal ADA gene (Wiginton et al. 1986) have been
characterized, facilitating studies of the molecular
defects in patients with ADA deficiency. The specific
mutations found to date have been similar to those found
in other inherited disorders. In most patients Northern
RNA analyses have revealed normal sized ADA mRNA
(Adrian et al. 1984), suggesting that most ADA mutant
alleles carry a point mutation leading to an inactive or
unstable ADA protein. In eight mutant ADA cDNAs
sequenced to date, point mutations affecting amino acid
sequence have been found (Bonthron et al. 1985; Valerio
et al. 1986; Akeson et al. 1987, 1988). One patient
has been described with abnormal sized ADA mRNA,
and an RNA splicing defect was identified in this case
(Akeson et al. 1987). In two patients, no ADA mRNA
has been detected. These patients have been shown to
carry deletions encompassing the first exon and promoter regions of the ADA gene (Berkvens et al. 1987;
Markert et al. 1988).
We are interested in elucidating the molecular defect

Common Point Mutation in ADA Deficiency
in patients with ADA deficiency who are well characterized clinically and immunologically. In this study,
we began our work by focusing on one patient, LB,
who was previously shown to have very low levels of
ADA enzyme activity (Markert et al. 1987a). The research described in the present paper led to the precise
definition of the mutation in this patient, a point mutation leading to the substitution of valine for alanine
in the ADA protein. As the point mutation created a
restriction-site polymorphism, it was possible by Southern analysis to screen additional patients for this mutation. The surprising result of this study was that five
of 13 patients (seven of 23 alleles) were found to carry
this mutation. These patients represented a wide diversity of ethnic and racial backgrounds. This is an unusually high percentage of a particular mutation in an
unselected population.

Probes

The ADA cDNA and genomic probes were provided
by Dr. John Hutton (Cincinnati). The cDNA and first
exon genomic probes used in figures 1 and 2 have been
described in detail elsewhere (Markert et al. 1987b).
The genomic probe used in figure 4 is the 849-bp-PstIPstI genomic fragment whose 3' end is in exon 11. The
genomic probe mentioned in table 1 is the 299-bp PstIPstI genomic fragment whose 5' end is in exon 5 (see
Wiginton et al. 1986 for sequences). The actin control
probe, pHF1A.1, a cDNA for human fibroblast cytoplasmic 13 actin (Gunning et al. 1983), was provided
by Dr. Larry Kedes (Stanford). The probes were labeled
with 32p to a specific activity of >108 cpm/ pg by using
the random primer method (Feinberg and Vogelstein
1983, 1984).
cDNA Synthesis, Cloning, and Sequencing

Material and Methods
Cell Lines

B lymphoblastoid cell lines were established from
Ficoll-Hypaque-purified peripheral mononuclear cells
by Epstein-Barr virus transformation (Markert et al.
1987b; Katsuki and Hinuma 1975). The patients
reported in the present paper have been extensively studied clinically at Duke University Medical center (Buckley et al. 1986; Markert et al. 1987a). Enzymatic studies
have confirmed the patients' lack of ADA enzymatic
activity (Markert et al. 1987a). HLA typing was used
to confirm the identity of the cell lines.
RNA and DNA Purification from the Lymphoblastoid
Cell Lines

RNA was harvested by the technique of Chirgwin
(1979; Markert et al. 1987b) by using guanidine
isothiocyanate extraction and purification by cesium
chloride gradient centrifugation. Poly A+ RNA was
isolated according to a method described elsewhere (Avis
and Leder 1972). DNA was purified by the method of
Gustafson et al. (1987).
Southern DNA Analyses

These analyses were done using minor modifications
of the standard technique of Southern (Southern 1975),
as described by Markert et al. (1987b).
Northern RNA Analyses

These analyses were done using formaldehyde agarose
gels according to a method described elsewhere (Markert et al. 1987b).

cDNA was prepared by the method of Gubler and
Hoffman (1983). The cDNA was size-selected by the
potassium-acetate-gradient method of Aruffo and Seed
(1987). EcoRI adapters (Pharmacia) were added, and
the cDNA was cloned into XgtlO (Promega). This was
packaged (Promega) and titered on Escherichia coli
C600hfl. Two hundred thousand plaques were screened
by hybridization after transfer to nitrocellulose filters
by Benton and Davis plaque hybridization (Benton and
Davis 1977). DNA from positive clones was purified
by a plate lysate method (Maniatis et al. 1982), and
recombinants were confirmed by restriction-endonuclease mapping. cDNAs were subcloned into pUC and
then into M13 vectors. Both strands of five cDNA isolates were sequenced by dideoxy chain-termination analysis (Sanger et al. 1977; Markert et al. 1988).

ADA mRNA Levels

Figure 1 shows RNA blot hybridization (Northern
blot) of poly A+ RNA isolated from the B cell lines
established from the ADA-deficient patient LB, her parents, and a normal control. The probe used in panel
A was the BamHI-AccI fragment of the ADA cDNA,
which contains exons 2-12. Lanes 1-4 contain poly A+
RNA. All individuals show ADA mRNA of the correct
size (approximately 1,500 bases). As a control, the membrane in figure 1A was stripped and reprobed with a
human fibroblast cytoplasmic 1 actin cDNA as shown
in panel B. All poly A+ RNA samples, including the
RNA from patient LB in lane 3, hybridized well to the

The mutation at position 1081 causes an amino acid
substitution of valine for alanine at position 329 of the
protein sequence. The polymorphism at position 629
does not affect the amino acid sequence.

Southern Analysis of Mutation at Base Pair 1081

Analysis of the cDNA sequence around the 1081 mutation revealed that a new Ball restriction site had been
formed. Patient LB and her parents were examined to
determine whether she was homozygous for the mutation. Figure 4 (lanes 1-3) shows the results of a Southern analysis with DNA from the LB family. Patient LB
demonstrates only the abnormal restriction fragment
of 1.8 kb. Both of her parents carry one normal fragment of 2.6 kb and one abnormal fragment of 1.8 kb.
Thus, patient LB is homozygous for this mutation. Because of the cDNA sequencing studies shown in figure
3, we feel confident that this is the only mutation in
this patient's ADA mRNA.
Seven additional ADA-deficient patients (and/or their
parents) followed at our institution were screened by
Southern analysis in looking for this mutation. As can
be seen in figure 4, two additional patients from the
seven families tested carried this mutation; one (patient
JB) in addition to LB is homozygous for the mutation,
and another (patient BJ) is heterozygous for the muta-

tion. (Data from the normal families are not included.)
The homozygous state found in LB and JB can likely
be explained by their parents being related. The LB parents come from a small town and believe it is possible
that they could have an ancestor in common. The parents of JB are known to be related. Since DNA from
BJ's father is not available, it is not known whether BJ
inherited the 1081 mutation or whether it was a spontaneous mutation. LB, JB, and BJ are not related to each
other by recent intermarriage. They, GM2756, and
GM2825A come from widely scattered regions of the
United States and include both white and black individuals.

The sequences of five mutant alleles (GM1751, GM2471, GM2756, GM2825A, and GM2606) have been
published elsewhere (see Akeson et al. 1987 for previous summary; also see Akeson et al. 1988). Two of the
five (GM2825A and GM2756) carry the 1081 mutation. When our data are combined with data previously
published, we see that five of 13 patients and seven of
22 alleles with point mutations carry this mutation.
This is a relatively high frequency of a single point mutation in this population.
In an assessment of gene frequency, it is important
to determine which alleles are not included in the compilation. In this study, although 13 patients were examined, 22- not 26- alleles are included. In four individuals, only one allele is listed. For GM2471, only one
cDNA was successfully cloned (Valerio et al. 1986);
no comment can be made about the second allele. For
GM1715, the patient had "partial" ADA deficiency (Wolf
et al. 1976); one ADA cDNA was normal (Bonthron
et al. 1985). For GM2825A, the second allele carries
an RNA splicing problem (Akeson et al. 1987); thus,
it is not included in this compilation of point mutations. For one of our ADA-deficient patients, only DNA
from the mother was available, since the patient had
died in 1977. Thus, only one parental allele could be
examined by Southern analysis.
Our assessment of gene frequency in this population
may be somewhat high because we included both alleles of patient LB and JB. The parents ofJB are related,
and the parents of LB probably are related. Some investigators would count each patient only once. This would
lower the observed frequency of this mutation to 25%.
On the other hand, we may have underestimated the
frequency of this mutation, since, in the case of two
patients (three alleles), no patient material was available and parent DNA was screened. One of these parents might have been normal, and the affected patient
might have carried a spontaneous mutation on one allele. This would not have been detected by examination of parent DNA. Of 19 mutant alleles examined
from patient material, seven carried the 1081 mutation.
If only one allele each of LB and JB are counted, then
five of 17 alleles examined from patient material carry
the 1081 mutation.
A total of five other point mutations have been scattered throughout the ADA gene. None of these mutations create restriction-site changes that lend themselves
to screening by Southern analysis. In contrast to the
1081 alanine-to-valine mutation described in the present paper, none of the other mutations leading to amino

et

al.

acid substitutions have been detected more than two
times in the 10 alleles that have been fully sequenced.
Analysis of ADA Haplotypes in Patients Carrying
the 1081 Mutation

Table 1 divides the seven alleles carrying the 1081
mutation into three ADA haplotypes. The first three
alleles (the first haplotype) come from two white patients, GM2825A and LB. Sequence analysis has shown
that these three alleles carry an "A" at position 629.
The homozygosity of patient LB at position 629 was
confirmed by Southern analysis (data not shown). The
second three alleles (the second haplotype) comes from
two black patients, GM2756 and JB. These three alleles carry a "G" at position 629. GM2756's allele was
sequenced (Akeson et al. 1988). The nucleotide at 629
in patient JB's alleles was determined by Southern analysis (data not shown). The third haplotype is represented
by the affected allele of patient BJ. Southern analysis
reveals a restriction fragment that is of a different size
than those found in patients LB and JB (see table 1).
Thus, there are at least three haplotypes associated with
the 1081 mutation. The possibility also exists that there
may be more than three haplotypes, since DNA from
GM2825A and GM2756 was not examined by Southern analysis.

Common Point Mutation in ADA Deficiency
Discussion

The question arises as to why the 1081 mutation is
found so frequently in this ADA-deficient patient population. Since three different ADA haplotypes are shown
to carry the 1081 mutation, two possibilities are most
likely: either this is a very old mutation or position 1081
is a hot spot for mutation. The finding of three haplotypes is not consistent with a founder effect.
It is possible that the CpG dinucleotide at position
1081 is a hot spot for mutation. The dinucleotide CpG
is known to frequently be associated with C-to-T mutations and with G-to-A mutations (reviewed in Cooper
and Youssoufian 1988). The vast majority of CG mutations are CG-TG or CG-CA, consistent with methylation-induced deamination of 5-methylcytosine (Coulondre et al. 1978). This type of mutation was involved
not only in the 1081 mutation reported in the present
paper but also in three of the other five mutations described to date (CG to TG at 396, CG to CA at 397,
and CG to CA at 727; the numbers refer to the cDNA
sequence of Wiginton et al. [1986]). It is not involved
in the mutations at either position 334 or position 1006.
Thus, four of six mutations reported for ADA deficiency
involve this dinucleotide. What is unknown is why there
is such a predominance of mutations in the CpG at
position 1081, as opposed to any of the other CpG
dinucleotides in the ADA cDNA.
Our conclusions regarding this mutation in ADA
deficiency contrast with recent findings in phenylketonuria (PKU). In PKU, certain mutations are associated
with particular PKU haplotypes (DiLella et al. 1986,
1987). This suggests that all individuals with a given
mutation descended from a common ancestor (founder
effect). With the 1081 ADA mutation, individuals carrying the same mutation have different ADA haplotypes.
This argues against the founder effect.
It remains to be determined how the 1081 mutation
causes a lack of ADA enzyme activity. The mutation
is a conservative amino acid substitution of valine for
alanine. One would not predict this mutation to significantly affect protein hydrophobicity or secondary
structure (Garnier et al. 1978; Akeson et al. 1988). Some
information has already been published regarding this
mutation. Akeson et al. (1988) conducted in vitro transfection experiments using a cDNA whose only abnormality was the 1081 mutation. They found markedly
decreased levels of ADA activity, compared with experiments using the normal ADA cDNA (Akeson et al.
1988). Western blots of cell lysates from the cell line
GM2825A, which is heterozygous for this mutation

(Akeson et al. 1987), showed no immunoreactive material (Wiginton and Hutton 1982). Akeson concluded
from their studies that the mutant protein (Ala to Val,
1081) may be unstable or structurally altered (Akeson
et al. 1988). Ultimate proof will require in vitro mutagenesis of the 1081 mutation to wild type and demonstration of restored ADA activity. To investigate these
possibilities, in vitro translation experiments are currently underway with wild-type and mutant constructs.
Regardless of why the 1081 mutation is so common,
this observation may prove useful in patient studies.
Patients can easily be screened by Southern analysis.
In a high frequency of cases, this test will reveal the
underlying mutation of at least one allele.
