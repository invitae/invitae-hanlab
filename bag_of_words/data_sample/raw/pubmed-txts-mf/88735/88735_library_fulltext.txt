ABSTRACT We determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the 5' noncoding region and the first 74 amino acids
of the nonfunctional ,B-globin mRNA in a patient with homozygous ,B thalassemia. We identified the molecular defect as
a single nucleotide substitution in the coding region of the
mRNA. At the position corresponding to amino acid 17, replacement of an adenine by a uracil changes the triplet AAG,
which codes for lysine in the normal chain, to an amber termination codon, UAG. This type of thalassemia represents
an example of a nonsense mutation in man.

As nonthalassemic control, poly(A)-rich RNA was also prepared
from a patient with sickle cell anemia.
Determination of Sequence of the 5' Noncoding Region
of the mRNA. We used the method described for determining
the nucleotide sequence of the 5' noncoding regions of human
globin mRNAs (12, 15). Briefly, we used oligo(dT) to prime
full-length single-stranded cDNA synthesis from the mRNAs
with reverse transcriptase, and labeled the 3' ends of the cDNAs
with [a-32PIGTP (New England Nuclear, 300 Ci/mmol; 1 Ci
= 3.7 X 1010 becquerels) by using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. We then digested the cDNAs with Hae III, isolated
the labeled 3'-end 3-globin cDNA fragment on a 20% polyacrylamide gel in 7 M urea, and determined its sequence, which
corresponded to the 5' sequence of the mRNA, with the method
of Maxam and Gilbert (14).
Preparation of DNA Primers Specific for #-Globin mRNA.
The recombinant plasmid JW 102, which contains human
/3-globin cDNA (16) was prepared and the plasmid DNA was
purified by the procedure of Bolivar et al. (17). Containment
was according to National Institutes of Health guidelines.
We then isolated the DNA fragments containing the globin
sequences by digesting the plasmid DNA with restriction endonucleases (New England BioLabs) under the conditions
specified by the manufacturers. Plasmid DNA (1 mg) was first
digested with 2500 units of Hha I and the digestion products
were extracted with phenol and precipitated in ethanol. The
single fragment that contained the entire 3-globin cDNA insert
was isolated by discontinuous electrophoresis on a 0.8% preparative agarose gel according to the method of Polsky et al.
(18); 200 ,ug of this fragment was digested with 1000 units of
BamHI and 500 units of EcoRI. The resultant fragments were
again isolated by discontinuous electrophoresis on a 2% agarose
gel; 20 ,ug of the fragment that contained the 5' portion of
globin sequence was further digested with 40 units of Hae III
and 100 units of Hinfl. The fragments were separated by
electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide slab gel in 50 mM Tris
borate, pH 8.3/1 mM EDTA. DNAs were visualized by staining
with 0.02% methylene blue in 0.4 M NaOAc (pH 4.5) for 1 hr
at room temperature, and the fragments were eluted as described (12).
Determination of mRNA Sequence with Chain-Terminator Method. The sequence of the mRNA from the primer
binding site toward the 5' end was determined by the method
of Sanger et al. (13) with some modifications. Hybridization
mixture (10 ,ul) containing 0.3 pmol of the mRNA and 1.5 pmol
of the primer, 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, and 100 mM NaCl
was heated at 100°C for 3 min to denature the double-stranded
primer and then incubated at 65°C for 30 min to allow the
mRNA to anneal with the complementary strand of the DNA
primer. Synthesis was performed in four separate reverse
transcriptase reactions, each with one of the four chain terminators, 2',3'-dideoxy ATP, CTP, GTP, and TTP, to generate
partially elongated DNA products. Five microliters of the reaction mixture contained 2 Al of the hybridization mixture, 50

[0 thalassemia is characterized by the absence of 3-globin chain
synthesis in the homozygous state. In the majority of cases the
(3-globin structural gene is present; the amount of 3-globin
mRNA varies among different patients (1-10). In a Chinese
patient with homozygous 30 thalassemia, we have previously
shown by cDNA-RNA hybridization and RNA fingerprint
analysis that the authentic /3-globin mRNA was present but was
not translated in tivo or in vitro (11). This type of mRNA is of
particular interest because the defect in globin synthesis most
likely results from structural abnormality of this mRNA. The
absence of /-globin synthesis could arise from abnormalities
in the 5' noncoding region of the mRNA, affecting initiation
of protein synthesis. It could also be due to a nonsense mutation
in the early coding region, resulting in premature termination
of the globin chain. To detect the lesion, we analyzed the sequence of this patient's 3-globin mRNA.
By labeling the 3' end of the full-length single-stranded
cDNA as described (12), we were able to derive the sequence
of the /3-globin mRNA from its 5' end to the first 10 amino
acids. However, we were unable to obtain the /-globin coding
sequence unambiguously by analyzing Hae III-digested fragments of oligo(dT)-primed cDNAs because of contamination
by a and -y sequences which constituted more than 90% of the
mRNAs in this patient. Therefore, our strategy for sequencing
the coding region involved the preparation of polydeoxynucleotides with sequences complementary to regions of f,-globin
mRNA. These polydeoxynucleotides were used as primers in
sequencing the mRNA with the modified chain terminator
method of Sanger et al. (13). Alternatively, we synthesized the
[3-specific cDNA by extending the /3-specific primer to the 5'
end of the 3-globin mRNA from the patient's total mRNAs with
reverse transcriptase. We then digested the cDNA with Hae
III and determined the sequence of these fragments by the
method of Maxam and Gilbert (14).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Source of Globin mRNA. RNA was extracted from the reticulocyte of a Chinese patient with homozygous /0 thalassemia
with nonfunctional 3-globin mRNA, and the poly(A)-rich RNA
was purified on an oligo(dT)-cellulose column as described (11).

dATP, dGTP, and TTP each at 25 MM, [a-32P]dCTP (Amersham, 300 Ci/mmol) at 1 pM, 300 units of reverse transcriptase
per ml, and an appropriate amount of one of the four dideoxynucleoside triphosphates. The mixtures were incubated at 420C
for 15 min. To each reaction mixture, 1 of 0.5 mM dCTP was
added and incubation was continued for another 15 min. A
mixture of dyes in formamide was added, and the partially
elongated DNA products were analyzed on a 8% polyacrylamide slab gel as described (13, 19). Electrophoresis was run
at 1.2-1.5 kV for 3-4 hr.
Sequence Determination by the Maxam and Gilbert
Method. cDNA was first synthesized by extending the 13-specific primer to the 5' end of-the B° mRNA as follows. A mixture
of 50 pmol of the primer and 25 pmol of the mRNA in 50 ul was
preannealed as in the chain-terminator sequencing method.
The primer was extended to the 5' end of the mRNA with reverse transcriptase. The 200-ml reaction mixture contained the
above 50 ,ul, 50 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.3), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM
dithiothreitol, 100 mg of actinomycin D per ml, dATP, dGTP,
dCTP, and TTP at 400 MM each, [a-32P]dCTP at 0.1 Ci/mmol
(diluted from 300 Ci/mmol, New England Nuclear), and 400
units of reverse transcriptase per ml. The reaction mixture was
incubated at 37°C for 1 hr, and the cDNA was purified as described (12).
The single-stranded cDNA synthesized from the mRNA was
digested with Hae III and the restriction fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Fragments were visualized by autoradiography and isolated by
elution from the gel. Each fragment was then labeled at its 5'
end with 32P by using polynucleotide kinase (New England
BioLabs) and ['y-32P]ATP (New England Nuclear, 5000 Ci/
mmol) as described (12), and its sequence was determined by
the technique of Maxam and Gilbert (14).
RESULTS
of
the
5'
Sequence
Noncoding Region. With the method
of labeling the 3' end of the cDNA, we derived the entire 5'
noncoding sequence and the sequence corresponding to the first
10 amino acids of the f3-globin mRNA in this patient. The sequence, including the initiation codon AUG, was normal (gel
not shown). We also determined that the codon for the ninth
amino acid was UCU which codes for serine. This finding
confirms that the sequence we determined was derived from
and not from 6-globin mRNA because the latter would have
the sequence ACX to code for threonine at this position of the
chain.

Isolation of fl-Globin DNA Fragments for Use as Primers.
When the chimeric plasmid JW 102 was digested with Hha I,
the entire #-globin cDNA insert was contained in the largest
fragment, 1.7 kilobases (16) (Fig. 1). Digestion of this fragment
with EcoRI and BamHI produced three fragments, fA, fB, and
fC. Fragment fB contained the sequence corresponding to

FIG. 2. Sequence of the 5' end of mRNA by chain-terminator
method. ,8-Globin DNA fragment f5 (amino acids 27-43) was used as
primer, and the mRNA from sickle cell anemia (13S) or thalassemia
was template in the limited synthesis with reverse transcriptase. A,
C, G, and T represent four separate reactions containing one of the
dideoxynucleoside triphosphates: 40 ,uM ddATP, 0.4 AM ddCTP, 8
1gM ddGTP, or 20 ,M ddTTP. Artifacts were observed in this gel, as
has been described with this method (13). In addition to the artifact
mentioned in the text, at the first nucleotide position of amino acid
number 12, a band was seen in all four reactions in both mRNAs; at
the three nucleotide positions for amino acid number 13, a "pile-up"
of bands occurred. These ambiguities were resolved by using the
Maxam and Gilbert method.

amino acids 98-121. Further digestion of the fragment fC with
HinfI and Hae III produced five fragments. Of these, fragments f5, f3, and f4 contained sequences that corresponded to
amino acids 27-43, 43-74, and 74-98, respectively. The partial
restriction map surrounding the globin insert in the recombinant plasmid was derived by restriction enzyme mapping
technique (gels not shown).
We used these globin DNA fragments as primers to derive
the sequence of the patient's f-globin mRNA. With the exception described below, all the sequences obtained were

normal.
Abnormal Sequence Detected by the Chain-Terminator
Method. When we used fragment f5 (corresponding to amino
acids 27-43) as primer in sequencing the mRNA with the
chain-terminator method, we were able to determine the nucleotide sequence corresponding to amino acids 9-22 in the
3-globin mRNA (Fig. 2). All of the sequence in this region of
the f0 thalassemia mRNA was identical to that of the nonthalassemia control with one exception. Whereas in the control
mRNA the codon for lysine at amino acid 17 was AAG, in the
(0 thalassemia mRNA replacement of the first adenine by a
uracil resulted in the amber termination codon UAG.
With this method, however, ambiguities were seen in some
positions. For example, at the third position of the codon for
amino acid 16, a band was seen in all four reactions with the OS
mRNA. Hence, to establish unambiguously the nature of the
abnormality we detected in the B° mRNA, we confirmed the
finding with a different method.
Confirmation of the Amber Mutation by Use of the
Maxam and Gilbert Method. We used fragment fB (amino
acids 98-121) as primer to extend cDNA synthesis to the 5' end
of the 30 mRNA. The single-stranded cDNA was then digested
with Hae III and the fragments were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, (Fig. 3). Two fragments, R1 and R2, were
eluted from the gel, labeled at the 5' ends with 32P by using
polynucleotide kinase (12), and further purified on an 8%
polyacrylamide gel. Fragment R1 contained the sequence
corresponding to amino acids 27-74 of the f-globin and was
identical to the normal (gel not shown). Fragment R2 contained
a sequence that corresponded to the region from amino acid
27 to the 5' end of the mRNA (Fig. 4). It confirms the presence

of UAG instead of AAG at the position corresponding to amino
acid 17.
DISCUSSION
These studies localize the molecular lesion that results in the
absence of /3-globin chain synthesis in a patient with homozygous fP thalassemia. The defect has been identified as a single
nucleotide substitution in the coding region of the /3-globin
mRNA. At the position corresponding to amino acid 17, replacement of the first adenine in the lysine codon AAG by a
uracil results in the amber termination codon UAG. This causes
premature termination of the f3-globin chain in this position.
This type of 30 thalassemia is therefore an example of a nonsense mutation in man.
Studies from several laboratories have indicated that the
thalassemia syndromes are a heterogeneous group of disorders
in which defective synthesis of the normal globin chain could
arise from different molecular mechanisms. These include
deletion of globin genes (5, 21-25), unequal crossover events

(26, 27), and termination mutations (28-32). Even in 10 thalassemia, the underlying molecular defect could be quite diverse.
ithout A1 bn
For example, the type of 10 thalassemi
mRNA could be due to deletion of the 13-globin structural gene
or defective DNA transcription or mRNA processing. In the
type with detectable ,3-globin mRNA, in addition to the nonsense mutation described here possible mechanisms could include frameshift mutations and mutations affecting the initiation codon or other ribosomal binding sites. The Ferrara type
of thalassemia (33) with inducible 1-giobin synthesis may
arise from a different mechanism. It is likely that other nonsense
mutations will be found in thalassemia. These mutations may
occur at different positions along the globin chains. For example, in the sequence shown in Fig. 2, single nucleotide substitutions at amino acid 15 (UGG to UAG) and 22 (GAA to
UAA) would produce termination codons. Hence, we propose
that, in accordance with the nomenclature used for abnormal
hemoglobins, nonsense mutations should be defined by the
amino acid position and the codon changed. Thus, the mutant
we have described would be designated as 117 AAG-UAG or
117 UAG
The small amount of 1-globin mRNA present in the patient
we studied can be due to one or both of the following. First, the
patient could be doubly heterozygous for two types of 10
thalassemia, one with early termination and the other with no
production of 1-globin mRNA. Second, because the globin
chain synthesis prematurely terminates at amino acid 17, a large
part of the mRNA would. not be covered by ribosomes and so
would be exposed to nuclease degradation. Hence, measurement of newly synthesized 1-globin mRNA in this patient's
erythroid precursor cells may provide useful information on
the effect of protein synthesis on mRNA turnover in mammalian cells.
At present, no method is available for correcting the primary
defect in the DNA in a human genetic disorder. The nature of
the defect in this type of 130 thalassemia suggests that an alternative approach could be explored. It is known that nonsense
mutation in eukaryotic cells or viruses can be suppressed in vitro
by species of suppressor tRNA from yeasts (34-37). A possible
way of overcoming the defect in 10 thalassemia would be to
suppress the nonsense mutation with these tRNAs. Alternatively, other conditions which result in suppression of nonsense
mutation can also be tested with this patient's erythroid
cells.
