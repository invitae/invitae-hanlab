SUMMARY: Abnormal 9-hexosaminidase a chain mRNAs from an Ashkenazi Jewish
patient with the classical infantile Tay-Sachs disease contained intact or
truncated intron 12 sequences. Sequence analysis showed a single nucleotide
transversion at the 5' donor site of intron 12 from the normal G to C. This
provides the first evidence that this junctional mutation, also found
independently in two other laboratories by analysis of genomic clones, results
in functional abnormality. Analysis with normal and mutant oligonucleotides
as probes indicated that our patient was a compound heterozygote With only one
allele having the transversion. The patient studied in the other two
laboratories was also a compound heterozygote. Another Ashkenazi Jewish
patient was normal in this region in both alleles. Thus, the splicing defect
is the underlying genetic cause in some but not all Ashkenazi Jewish patients
with Tay-Sachs disease. © 1988 AcademicPress, Inc.

The classical infantile Tay-Sachs disease prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews
is the prototype of human sphingolipidoses [i].

The disease is caused by a

genetic deficiency of 9-hexosaminidase ~ subunit [2,3].

The cDNA and the gene

encoding the normal human 9-hexosaminidase a chain have been isolated and
characterized [4-6].

A major deletion in the 5' end of the gene was described

for Tay-Sachs disease occurring in the French-Canadian population [7,8].

We

identified specific point mutations responsible for the disease within the
protein-coding sequence of the gene in two mRNA-positive variants of the
disease [9,10].

However, the gene abnormality underlying the classical

Ashkenazi Jewish form of the disease remains elusive.

Even though the 9-

hexosaminidase a mRNA is nearly undetectable in this form [Ii], a diffuse
smear is usually visible on Northern analysis, consistent with a recent report
of normal transcription of the gene [12].

We isolated a series of abnormal 9-

hexosaminidase a cDNAs from fibroblasts of a patient and examined their
structure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials. The fibroblast cell lines obtained from the Human Genetic
Mutant Cell Depository, Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ,
included three cell lines from infantile Jewish patients (GM0502B, GM2968,
GM0515A).
Control cell lines were from our own collection.
All cultures were
maintained in our laboratory under the standardized conditions before use.
Bethesda Research Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD), Boerhinger Mannheim
(Indianapolis, IN), International Biotechnologies Inc. (New Haven, CT) and New
England Biolab (Beverley, MA) were the main sources for enzymes, reagents and
other molecular biological supplies. Radioisotopes were obtained from ICN
Radiochemieals (Irvine, CA). Sources for non-standard materials will be
indicated below as needed.
Northern Analysis.
Poly A+ RNA was prepared from fibroblasts from i00
150-mi flasks [13]. For routine Northern analysis, approximately 1 ~g of poly
A+ RNA/sample was electrophoresed in i% agarose/formaldehyde denaturing gel
[14]. The amount of RNA was increased to 10 ~g/sample to visualize the faint
signals in Jewish Tay-Sachs disease samples. Transfer of RNA to BIOTRANS TM
Nylon membrane (1.2 ~m)(ICN, Irvine, CA), hybridization with a full-length
normal ~-hexosaminidase a cDNA (pSHa-5)[4] labelled with [a-32p]dATP by nicktranslation [15], and subsequent washing were carried out as described by the
manufacturer.
Blots were exposed to Kodak X-ray film at -70 ° using a Cronex
Hi-Plus intensifying screen. An actin cDNA was used as the control probe.
Isolation of cDNA Clones.
The poly A+ RNA fraction was isolated from
fibroblasts from an Ashkenazi Jewish patient (GM0502B).
Because of the
expected low frequency of the ~-hexosaminidase a message, a cDNA library was
constructed from i0 ~g of the mRNA fraction essentially according to the
procedure of Gubler and Hoffman [16] but ligated into the lambda gtll phage
through the Eco RI linker. The library was screened, without amplification,
with the 32p-labelled normal full-length B-hexosaminidase a cDNA (pBHa-5)[4].
Contrary to our expectation of a low yield, more than 40 positive clones were
identified and 31 of them were purified.
Several clones were selected for
further studies on the basis that they were positive for the probes for the 5'
terminus, the middle portion, and the 3' terminus of the normal cDNA.
After
purification, the inserts were transferred to the pUC-13 plasmid vector.

DNA Sequence Analysis.
The DNA sequence analysis was carried out by the
Sanger dideoxy chain-termination method [17] with appropriate MI3 vectors, the
17-mer sequencing primer, and 35S-labelled dATP [18]. The DNA polymerases
used were either the Klenow enzyme or the commercial Sequenase (US Biochem.
Corp., Cleveland, Ohio).
Genomic DNAAnalysis with Oligonucleotide Probes. In order to examine
possible genetic heterogeneity of Tay-Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish
population, two 21-mer oligonucleotide probes with the normal and mutant
sequences, centered around the mutation, were synthesized.
Genomic DNA was
isolated according to the standard procedure [19] and digested with Hpa I and
Xba I. Agarose gel electrophoresis, direct drying of the gel, labelling of
the probes with multiple 32p-nucleotides, hybridization to the separated DNA,
and autoradiography were done essentially as described b y T h e i n and Wallace
without modification [20].

RESULTS
Northern Analysls.

While ~-hexosaminidase a mRNA is nearly undetectable

in the Ashkenazi Jewish form of Tay-Sachs disease on the standard Northern
analysis, positive signals could be visualized when 10 ~g of the nlRNA fraction

464

was applied,

BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS

or when a probe of very high specific activity or a long exposure

time was used (Fig. i).

The signal was usually a diffuse smear ranging from

the area substantially larger than the normal ~-hexosaminidase a mRNA to the
area of the normal a chain message.

Positive signals of the abnormally large

sizes in the area of 3 kb were not obvious in controls even when 10 ~g of mRNA
was applied,

suggesting that they might represent abnormally large and

unstable mRNA produced by the Tay-Sachs fibroblasts.
Structure of eDNAs.

Restriction mapping of three eDNA clones obtained

from the unamplified eDNA library indicated that they contained an abnormal
segment of several hundred bases not present in the normal full-length eDNA.
Its location was between the downstream Kpn I and the unique Hinc II sites and
contained several restriction sites (Stu I, Pvu II, Hinc II, Sau3A I, Apa
I)(Fig. 2).

The normal full-length eDNA did not hybridize to the Pvu II-Apa I

Fig. 2. Restriction maps of abnormal ~-hexosaminidase a cDNAs isolated
from a Ashkenazi Jewish Tay-Saehs disease. Compared to the normal sequence,
three clones contained an extra segment (light shaded bar) located between the
Kpn I in exon 12 and Hinc II in exon 13 in the normal eDNA. The abnormal
segment appeared shorter in clones 7AI and 4BI at the 3' end, missing the
Sau3A I and Apa I sites. Names of restriction sites are abbreviated: K, Kpn
I; H, Hinc II; St, Stu I; P, Pvu II; S, Sau3A I; A, Apa I. Sequence
analysis indicated that the extra segment is intron 12, intact in Clone 9AI
and truncated in Clones 4BI and 7AI.

restriction fragment within this segment.

Since the downstream Kpn I site is

at the 5' end of exon 12 and the unique Hinc II site is within exon 13, it was
plausible that this abnormal segment might be intron 12.

Sequence analysis of

the segment between the Kpn I and the unique Hinc II sites showed that the
extra segment is indeed intron 12, either intact or truncated at the 3' end
(Fig. 3)[6].

No sequence abnormalities were detected around the junction of

intron 12 and exon 13 in clone 9AI.

However, the first nucleotide at the 5'

donor site of intron 12 was consistently C, instead of the normal G.

In a

recent survey of nearly 1500 exon-intron junctional sequences, the first two
nucleotides at the 5' donor site of introns were always GT [21].

Thus, the

single-base transversion from G to C at the exon 12-intron 12 junction can
explain the retention of intron 12 in these mRNAs.

first experimental evidence that the junctional mutation in fact results in a
series of abnormal and unstable ~-hexosaminidase a chain mRNAs.

Preliminary

results on these and additional cDNAs indicate that the consequences of the
splicing defect are complex and not limited to retention of intron 12.
Detailed characterization of a series of abnormal ~-hexosaminidase a chain
mRNA is underway.
The high incidence and the uniform clinical/pathological

features of

infantile Tay-Sachs disease among Ashkenazi Jews were suggestive of a single
genetically homogeneous disorder.

The founder effect and other factors have

been proposed to explain the unusually high concentration of the disease in a
single ethnic group.

However, the analysis of genomlc DNA with the normal and

mutant oligonucleotide probes showed clearly that two patients were compound
heterozygotes with only one allele carrying the exon 12-intron 12 junctional
mutation and that another patient was normal in this region,

Our results are

in agreement with those of Myerowitz who, taking advantage of the new Dde i
site generated by the mutation (Fig. 3), found only six out of the twenty
heterozygous carriers with the Junctional mutation [22].

The infantile Tay-

Sachs disease among the Ashkenazi Jewish population is thus genetically
heterogeneous.

The junctional mutation is only one of the two or possibly

more different mutations responsible for Ashkenazi Jewish Tay-Sachs disease.
