We have screened seven Spanish phenylketonuric (PKU) families for the most prevalent Mediterranean and Caucasian mutations, and have subsequently found mutations P281L and IVS10. We have analyzed these two mutations in 23 of our patients. The frequencies found correspond to those of Mediterranean countries, such as Italy. This is the first report of a mutation analysis in the Spanish PKU population.
