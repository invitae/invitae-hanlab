Summary. We have screened seven Spanish phenylketonuric (PKU) families for the most prevalent Mediterranean and Caucasian mutations, and have subsequently
found mutations P281L and IVS10. We have analyzed
these two mutations in 23 of our patients. The frequencies found correspond to those of Mediterranean countries, such as Italy. This is the first report of a mutation
analysis in the Spanish P K U population.

Introduction
Classical phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the phenylalanine
hydroxylase (PAH) gene. Several types of mutations
have to date been established.
Molecular studies have identified a genetic basis for
clinical and biochemical heterogeneity. Different restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotypes
have been described associated with the P A H gene and in
linkage disequilibrium with specific mutations. In Northern Europe, the two most common mutations are R408W
and IVS12, associated with haplotypes 2 and 3, respectively (Dilella et al. 1986, 1987). A different haplotype
distribution and linked mutations have been reported in
the Mediterranean countries. Thus, two prevalent mutations have been identified in Southern Europe: a substitution of Leu for Pro (P281L) at amino acid 281 (Okano et
al. 1991), and a G-to-A transition in intron 10 creating a
cryptic splice acceptor site (IVS10) (Dasovich et al. 1991;
Kalaydjieva et al. 1991).
In Spain, neonatal mass-screening has shown an incidence of P K U of approximately 1 : 10000 (Ugarte 1982).
In our laboratory in Madrid, we have diagnosed 96 cases
of P K U and have determined the phenotype in 60 of
these cases. These data reveal a prevalence of mild PKU
(57%) versus classical P K U (16%). The rest of our patients correspond to non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia
(P6rez et al. 1991).

In order to investigate the genetic heterogeneity of
P A H deficiencies in Spain, an initial screening of 10
PKU mutations was performed in seven families. The
two mutations found, P281L and IVS10, were further
screened in a group of 23 Spanish P K U patients.

Patients and methods
The study included 23 PKU patients, most of them detected in the
neonatal screening program. The patients come from different
regions of Spain and were classified using the criteria described by
Giittler (1980) as having classical PKU (5 cases), mild type PKU
(14 cases) or non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia (4 cases).
Mutation-containing regions of the PAH gene were amplified
by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the genomic DNA
of each PKU patient, with the purpose of detecting PKU mutations (Dilella et al. 1988). Allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO)
screening was performed to identify the previously described
mutations: R252W (Abadie et al. 1989), R261Q (Abadie et al.
1989), G272X (Svensson et al. 1990), $273F (Melle et al. 1992),
E280K (Lyonnet et al. 1989), P281L (Okano et al. 1991), IVS10
(Dasovich et al. 1991; Kalaydjieva et al. 1991), R408W (Dilella et
al. 1987), IVS12 (Dilella et al. 1986) and Y414C (Okano et al.
1991).
Direct sequencing of the purified PCR products was performed
according to the method described by Reichardt and Woo (1991)
and Svensson et al. (1990). In some cases, amplified exons 7 and 10
were cloned in pUC9 and sequenced.

Results and discussion
We have initiated a P K U mutation analysis in seven families and have screened those mutations described as occurring most frequently in Mediterranean countries
(R252W, R261Q, G272X, $273F, E280K, P281L and
IVS10). Two prevalent mutations found among Caucasians (R408W and IVS12), and one that exhibits a
mild phenotype (Y414C) were also analyzed. In these
seven families, two mutations were found: P281L and
IVS10.
Consequently, we screened these two mutations in a
total of 23 patients. Using ASO hybridization analysis,
we have screened for the IVS10 mutation and have

f o u n d 5 m u t a n t alleles. F u r t h e r m o r e , we have analyzed
the P281L m u t a t i o n and have f o u n d 3 m u t a n t alleles.
Kindred analysis was p e r f o r m e d on families bearing the
P281L and the IVS10 mutations to determine the carrier
of the mutation. The mutations in some families have
b e e n confirmed by sequencing the c o r r e s p o n d i n g exon.
The frequencies found, 3/46 for the P281L m u t a t i o n
and 5/46 for the IVS10 substitution, are similar to those
r e p o r t e d in Italy for these mutations ( O k a n o et al. 1991;
Dasovich et al. 1991) (Table 1). We found a correlation
between haplotype 1 and the P281L mutation, as has been
described in several M e d i t e r r a n e a n countries ( O k a n o et
al. 1991). O u r preliminary study of Spanish P K U haplotypes in 10 families (unpublished results) shows a prevalence of haplotype 1 associated both with m u t a n t and
normal c h r o m o s o m e s ; we have also found a major incidence of haplotypes 6, 9 and 27 associated with P K U alleles. H o w e v e r , we have not found haplotypes 2 and 3,
which are prevalent in N o r t h e r n E u r o p e (Dilella et al.
1986, 1987). These data are similar to the haplotype distribution in Italy (Dianzani et al. 1990). In general, the
M e d i t e r r a n e a n countries have b e e n f o u n d to be genetically alike.
The patients bearing the P281L m u t a t i o n (one in the
h o m o z y g o u s and one in the h e t e r o z y g o u s state) have a
classical P K U p h e n o t y p e . This is consistent with the data
r e p o r t e d by O k a n o ( O k a n o et al. 1991). The patients
with the IVS10 substitution are all heterozygotes and
exhibit a mild p h e n o t y p e . This m u t a t i o n has been described as being associated with classical P K U in the
h o m o z y g o u s state (Dasovich et al. 1991). Since mild
mutations prevail over severe mutations in the p h e n o typic manifestation of P K U , the IVS10 substitution in our
population should be c o m b i n e d with an as yet undefined
mild mutation(s).
O u r results suggest that the Spanish P K U population
does not differ considerably f r o m that of Southern E u r o p e a n countries, such as Italy. T h e two most prevalent
M e d i t e r r a n e a n mutations are those that we have detected to date in our patients. Nevertheless, the identified mutations are represented in only a small n u m b e r
of the total P K U alleles. We are currently sequencing
the P A H exons of several P K U patients, and searching
for new mutations that could account for the remaining
Spanish P K U alleles.
