The Mutations in Ashkenazi Jews with Adult GM2
Gangliosidosis, the Adult Form of Tay-Sachs Disease
RUTH NAVON* AND RicHARD L. PRoIAt
The adult form of Tay-Sachs disease, adult GM2 gangliosidosis, is an autosomal
recessive disorder that results from mutations in the a chain of (3-hexosaminidase A.
This disorder, like infantile Tay-Sachs disease, is more frequent in the Ashkenazi
Jewish population. A point mutation in the a-chain gene was identified that results in
the substitution of Gly26' with Ser in eight Ashkenazi adult GM2 gangliosidosis
patients from five different families. This amino acid substitution was shown to
depress drastically the catalytic activity of the a chain after expression in COS-1 cells.
All ofthese patients proved to be compound heterozygotes of the allele with the Gly to
Ser change and one of the two Ashkenazi infantile Tay-Sachs alleles. These findings
will aid in the diagnosis and understanding of ,B-hexosaminidase A deficiency
disorders.
BOOTH ADULT GM2 gangliosidosis and
the infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease are autosomal recessive diseases
caused by a deficiency of P-hexosaminidase
A, a lysosomal enzyme composed of a and ,B
chains (1). The enzyme deficiency is a consequence of mutations in the a-chain gene. As
a result, there is a progressive accumulation
of GM2 ganglioside, the natural substrate of
P-hexosaminidase A, leading to degenerative changes in the nervous system. However, with respect to onset and severity, the
two disorders are very different. In infantile
Tay-Sachs disease, the age of onset is within
the first year of life with death ensuing in
early childhood after progressive motor and
mental deterioration. In the adult disease (2,
3), onset usually occurs in the second or
third decade with lower motor neuron, pyr-

amidal tract, and cerebellar deterioration. In
many cases psychosis seems to be an integral
part of the disease and precedes the other
neurological manifestations (3). Both the
adult and infantile diseases are more prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews than in the general
population, with the infantile form predominating.

Recently it has been shown that two
different mutations in the a-chain gene unGenetics and Biochemistry Branch, National Institute of

surface ligand recognize an identical or
closely related receptor binding site.
Thrombospondin (TSP), an adhesive glycoprotein, has also been proposed as a receptor for cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes (18). Our purified CD36 was not
contaminated with TSP, as determined by
Coomassie blue and silver staining of protein separated by SDS-PAGE and by enzyme immunoassay with antiserum to TSP
(17). In addition, TSP is synthesized by
many cells that do not have the capacity to
bind P. falciparum-infected cells (9). This
lack of correlation between the presence of
TSP and binding argues against the specificity of TSP as a cytoacherence receptor.
Surface expression of a receptor recognized
by MAb OKM5 is correlated with the ability of various monocyte and melanoma cell
lines to bind infected erythrocytes (9, 10).
Furthermore, much higher concentrations
of TSP than of CD36 are required for
significant inhibition of cytoadherence to
C32 melanoma cells (200 ,ug/ml versus <10
,ug/ml), and neither TSP nor antibodies to
TSP have been reported to reverse cytoadherence. It is possible that CD36 and TSP
have sequence similarities that account for
the binding of infected erythrocytes to either of these purified proteins when immobilized on plastic. Altematively, CD36 and
TSP may bind to independent ligands on
the surface of K+-infected erythrocytes.
Although these results strongly suggest
that CD36 is a malaria sequestration receptor, the identity of the complementary ligand on the infected erythrocyte surface is
still unknown. It has been suggested that the
cytoadherence ligand is a poorly immunogenic conserved domain that is masked by a
more immunogenic, strain-specific moiety
on the surface of P. falciparum-infected
erythrocytes (19). The availability of purified CD36 should allow identification and
characterization of epitopes on the cytoadherence ligand that may be useful for a
malaria vaccine. Soluble CD36, or a fragment thereof that can reverse cytoadherence
in vitro, may also be useful therapeutically
for rapid reversal of sequestration in cerebral
malaria or other complicated forms of this
disease.

derlie Ashkenazi infantile Tay-Sachs disease:
a splice junction mutation (4-6) at the 5'
end of intron 12 accounts for -30% of the
mutant alleles (4, 5) and a 4-base-pair insertion in exon 11 accounts for the remaining
-70% (7). Both of the infantile Tay-Sachs
mutations result in nearly undetectable levels of mRNA (6, 8-10), as well as a complete
absence of a-chain protein (11) and of Ihexosaminidase A activity (1). In contrast,
a-chain mRNA (12) and a precursor a-chain
polypeptide are readily detectable in fibroblasts from adult patients (13, 14). Apparently this mutant a chain is able to form a
small amount of active enzyme because these
adult patients demonstrate a low level of
activity if GM2 ganglioside is used as a
Fig. 1. Nudeotide sequence
of a-chain cDNA from a patient with GM2 ganglosidosis. An a-chain cDNA isolated from patient S.R. was subdoned into the Eco RI site of
pUCl3. The normal a-chain
cDNA has been described
(9). The cDNAs were sequenced by the dideoxy-

substrate (15). No significant activity is detected with synthetic substrates (2).
To identify the molecular defect in adult
GM2 gangliosidosis, a cDNA library was
constructed (16) with polyadenylated RNA
prepared from the skin fibroblasts of a well
studied 45-year-old Ashkenazi patient
(S.R.) (17). This patient is an obligate carrier of an infantile Tay-Sachs allele, as one of
his children was affected with this disorder.
Since the Tay-Sachs infantile alleles give rise
to little detectable mRNA, any cDNA clone
isolated from this library was likely to be
derived from the mRNA-positive adult GM2
gangliosidosis allele. The cDNA library was
screened for a-chain recombinants and the

quenced. This analysis revealed that the
cDNA was truncated at the 5' end and
contained 1033 ofthe 1587 base pairs of the
a-chain protein coding region (9). The only
difference between the normal and the
mutant cDNA sequence was a single nucleotide substitution, G to A, changing Gly269
(GGT) to Ser (AGT) (Fig. 1). The cDNA
showed no evidence of either of the Ashkenazi infantile mutations.
Since the nucleotide change in the cDNA
occurs at the 3' nucleotide of exon 7 in the
a-chain gene (18), we investigated the possibility that the mutation might extend into
the intron. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (19), we amplified 190 base
pairs of this patient's genomic DNA surrounding the G to A base change. A restriction fragment of the amplified DNA was
cloned and sequenced. Two types of clones
were found, one containing a normal sequence and the other with the same G to A
change as in the cDNA with no alteration of
the intron sequence (Fig. 2). The two sequences demonstrate, as was anticipated
(17), that this patient is a heterozygote for
the allele containing the G to A point mutaWe next developed an assay to screen for
this point mutation in other adult patients.
The 190-base-pair region surrounding the
mutation was amplified from genomic DNA
by the PCR technique, and the product was
blotted onto a hybridization membrane.
The samples were hybridized with allelespecific oligonucleotide probes to detect either the sequence containing the G to A
change or the corresponding normal sequence. Amplified genomic DNA of eight
Ashkenazi adult patients from five unrelated
families were positive for the point mutation
(Fig. 3). A normal Ashkenazi control and
two Ashkenazi infantile Tay-Sachs carriers,
each with a different mutation, were negative for the G to A change. To exclude the
possibility that the G to A change is a
neutral polymorphism, we screened genomic DNA from an additional ten normal
Ashkenazi Jews and ten heterozygote carriers of one of the Ashkenazi infantile TaySachs alleles. None of these DNA samples
were positive for the G to A mutation. Both
patients and controls were positive with the
probe carrying the normal sequence (Fig. 3)
and could not be distinguished at any of the
washing temperatures tested, consistent
with compound heterozygosity in all of the
patients.
We determined if the presumed compound heterozygosity was a result of the
allele bearing the G to A change in combination with either of the infantile Tay-Sachs
alleles. The regions surrounding the infantile splice junction mutation in intron 12

and the 4-base-pair insertion in exon 11
were amplified by the PCR technique. The
amplified DNA samples were blotted on a
filter and hybridized to allele-specific oligonucleotide probes under conditions that detect the infantile mutations (4, 7). The autoradiograms (Fig. 3) clearly indicate that each
adult patient carries an Ashkenazi infantile
Tay-Sachs mutant allele; two patients carry
the splice junction mutation in intron 12
and the remaining six carry the more common insertion in exon 11. These results
demonstrate that all the patients are compound heterozygotes with one allele containing the G to A change in exon 7 and the
other harboring one of the two Ashkenazi
infantile Tay-Sachs mutations.
We studied the segregation of the alleles
bearing the G to A mutation and the infantile insertion mutation in three generations
of the family of the two related patients,
R.O. and A.O. (Fig. 4, III-1 and III-2). The
allele bearing the G to A mutation was
inherited from the patients' father (II-1) and
is also carried by their grandmother (I-1)
(Fig. 4). The infantile Tay-Sachs allele segregated from the maternal side; the patients'
mother (II-2), aunt (II-3), and cousin (III4) harbor this insertion defect. The unaffected sibling (III-3) carries the adult but not
the infantile mutation.
We investigated the consequence of the G
to A point mutation on the catalytic activity
associated with the at chain. The G to A
change was introduced into the normal atchain cDNA by oligonucleotide mediated
site-directed mutagenesis (20). The normal
and the mutated ax-chain cDNAs were inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector,
pSVL, and the plasmid DNAs were transfected into COS-1 cells (21). The cell extracts were assayed with a synthetic substrate
(22) specific for the catalytic activity of the a
chain (23). Transfection with the normal at
chain (pSVLa) resulted in a large increase of
catalytic activity. Most of this activity is
likely to represent 3-hexosaminidase S (aaot)
I7 MARCH I989

because greater than 90% of the activity was
not precipitable with antibodies reactive
with the 3 chain. In contrast to the normal
cDNA, no increase over background activity
was observed with the cDNA containing the
G to A change (pSVLoa Gly269 -* Ser)
(Table 1). The cells transfected with the
mutant cDNA were found, however, to
synthesize an a-chain polypeptide (12).
We have shown that all adult Tay-Sachs
patients tested thus far carry a mutated achain allele with a Gly269 to Ser change. In
all of the patients, the allele bearing this
point mutation was found in combination
with one ofthe two Ashkenazi infantile TaySachs alleles. Although the frequency of the
adult mutation is not yet established, it is
thought to be rare (24). Thus, the appearance of the adult disorder in Ashkenazi Jews
is, in large part, due to the high carrier
frequency (1/30) of the infantile Tay-Sachs
alleles.
The Gly269 to Ser change is functionally
significant because it eliminated the catalytic
activity associated with the a chain. A previous study had demonstrated that the a chain
expressed in fibroblasts from adult GM2
gangliosidosis patients is defective in subFig. 3. The ax-chain mutations in Ashkenazi adult
GM2gangliosidosis patients. Genomic DNA (indicated at the top of the figure) was isolated from
the blood samples of a normal Ashkenazi individual (normal control), and from two infantile TaySachs carriers; one harboring the splice Junction
mutation (SPL) and the other carrying the 4base-pair insertion mutation (INS). The other
DNAs were from adult GM2 gangliosidosis pa-

unit assembly (14). Thus, the lack of activity
after expression in COS-1 cells may be the
inability of the a chain with the Gly269 to
Ser change to dimerize and form catalytically active P-hexosaminidase S (aao) (1). The
importance of this Gly at position 269 is
also suggested by its conservation in both
the homologous human 1 chain (10, 25) and
in 1-hexosaminidase from the slime mold
Dictyostylium discoideum (26).
Although the cDNA that we isolated appeared to be derived from a correctly spliced
mRNA, it is possible that the G to A
mutation, because of its position at the 3'
end of exon 7, might disrupt the splicing of
a fraction of the a-chain mRNA. The Spfash
mutation in the mouse ornithine transcarbamylase gene, also a G to A change occurring
in the last nucleotide of an exon, has been
shown to result in some misspliced mRNA
(27).
The identification of the mutation in
adult GM2 gangliosidosis, together with the
two previously identified infantile Tay-Sachs
mutations, will facilitate the study and diagnosis of 3-hexosaminidase deficiencies in the
Ashkenazi population. With the exception

(7), these three a-chain mutations are responsible for the P-hexosaminidase A deficiency in all Ashkenazi adult GM2 gangliosidosis patients and infantile Tay-Sachs patients tested thus far. Diagnosis based on
these mutations will be helpful for carrier
detection and genetic counseling when the
enzymatic assay is inconclusive. Furthermore, it is now possible, with allele-specific
probes, to distinguish carriers of the adult
mutation from carriers of the infantile mutations, which is not achievable with the conventional enzymatic assay. Finally, it will be
of interest to determine if the mutation
described here is present in the various
clinical forms (juvenile, chronic, and adult)
associated with P-hexosaminidase A deficiency in Ashkenazi Jews and in other ethnic
groups (28) and to assess the clinical consequences of this mutation in a homozygous
form.
Note added in proof: We have learned that
Paw et al. (29) have also identified The

Quisqualate Activates a Rapidly Inactivating High
Conductance Ionic Channel in Hippocampal Neurons
CHA-MIN TANG, MARC DICHTER, MARTIN MORAD
Glutamate activates a number of different receptor-channel complexes, each of which
may contribute to generation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the mammalian
central nervous system. The rapid application of the selective glutamate agonist,
quisqualate, activates a large rapidly inactivating current (3 to 8 milliseconds), which is
mediated by a neuronal ionic channel with high unitary conductance (35 picosiemens).
The current through this channel shows pharmacologic characteristics similar to those
observed for the fast excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC); it reverses near 0
millivolts and shows no significant voltage dependence. The amplitude of the current
through this channel is many times larger than that through the other non-NMDA (Nmethyl-D-aspartate) channels. These results suggest that this high-conductance quisqualate-activated channel may mediate the fast EPSC in the mammalian central
nervous system.

important excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central
nervous system (1). The glutamate-evoked
current is the result of the behavior of more
than one type of glutamate channel coexisting on the same neuron (2, 3). These different receptor-channel complexes are postulated to play a variety of physiological roles (4-

7). A rapidly desensitizing component of
the glutamate-evoked current is seen when
the agonist is applied rapidly (8-11). Here,
we identify and characterize the properties
