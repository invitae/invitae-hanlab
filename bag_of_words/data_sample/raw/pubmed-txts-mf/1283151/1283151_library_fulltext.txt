Abstract. G e r m a n cystic fibrosis patients were screened
for mutations in exon 21 of the cystic fibrosis transmembrahe conductance regulator gene by a non-radioactive
variation of the single-strand conformation polymorphism
technique. Asymetric polymerase chain reaction amplification was used to produce single strands of exon-containing genomic sequences that were analyzed on polyacrylamide gels subsequently stained with ethidium bromide. This rapid technique led to the identification of a
novel mutation, a 1-bp deletion at position 4035(A) of
the c D N A sequence. The patient, who is also heterozygous for the AF508 mutation, exhibits an intermediate
form of the disease.

Introduction
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most c o m m o n and severe genetic diseases among Caucasian populations, and
is probably the most frequent disease being traced by
molecular techniques in G e r m a n y . The inheritance is autosomal recessive and the coding sequence of the responsible gene has been cloned and sequenced (Riordan
et al. 1989; Zielenski et al. 1991).
The most striking feature of this disease is probably
the presence of an identical 3-bp deletion in exon 10,
AF508, on 68% of all CF chromosomes worldwide and
on approximately 75% in G e r m a n y . The remainder of
mutations are highly heterogeneous with two apparent
clusters around exons 9 through 12, and exons 20 through
22, respectively (e.g. Cutting et al. 1990; K e r e m et al.
1990).
In a retrospective study, we have previously shown
that single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)
analysis (Orita et al. 1989) reliably detects all tested mutations within the cystic fibrosis t r a n s m e m b r a n e conductance regulator (CFTR) exon 11 (Plieth et al. 1992). In
the meantime, we have established a nonradioactive version of this technique based on asymetric single-strand
production (Gyllensten and Erlich 1988). We have used
this method for mutation screening of exon 21 of the
C F T R gene and have identified a novel 1-bp deletion.

Case report
The male patient is now 9 years old and was born to healthy parents of German origin after a normal pregnancy and with a birth
weight of 3340 g. Within 10 weeks of life, symptoms occurred, such
as fatty stools, failure to thrive and recurrent broncho-pulmonary
infections. At the age of 11 weeks, the final diagnosis was established by a positive sweat chloride test. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
first occurred in the sputum at the age of 6 years. Thorax X-rays
now show moderate changes. In summary, we classify this patient
as an intermediate case of CF.

Materials and methods
Genomic DNA was isolated by the method of Miller et al. (1988).
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed as described
previously (Plieth et al. 1992) with oligonucleotides Ex21SSCP-F
(5'CAT ACT TI'C TTC TCC T I T TCT T I T TTG; the underlined
base represents a mismatch-compared with the genomic sequence)
and Ex21SSCP-R (5'CCC CTT TCA AAA TCA T I T CAG TT),
which yields a wild-type fragment of 157 bp. An aliquot of 1 ktl of
the symetric amplification product was subjected to asymetric PCR
adding only one of the above oligonucleotides (50 pmo! Ex21SSCPR). The asymetric PCR product (20 gl) was heated at 95~ for 3 min
and loaded with 30 ~tl sequencing stop buffer (United States Biochemicals, USA) on a 12% vertical polyacrylamide gel (without
glycerol). Samples were electrophoresed at 4~ and 220 V for 20 h.
The gel was stained in ethidium bromide and photographed on a
UV transilluminator.
For sequencing, double-stranded (first round) PCR products
were electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gels. Gel fragments
containing the target DNA were extracted and the DNA subsequently sequenced according to Zielenski et al. (1991).

Results and discussion
We have previously examined the suitability of SSCP analysis for mutation detection in exon 11 of the C F T R
gene (Plieth et al. 1992). By using asymetric single-strand
production, we could omit radioactive labeling for this
application (data not shown). This method has now been
employed prospectively for mutation screening within
exon 21. The oligonucleotides used for symetric and subsequent asymetric P C R were selected from intronic se-

CF patients exhibiting only the wild-type pattern; lane 4, CF patient heterozygous for 4035 delA; lane C, control (heterozygous for
NI303K); lane M, size standard (kb-ladder, Bethesda Research
Laboratories, USA). The upper bands (ds) represent residual double-stranded DNA (with heteroduplexes in lanes 4 and C), the
lower bands (ss) are single-stranded DNA

Neither the described mutation, 4035delA, nor any
o t h e r SSCP b a n d pattern alteration was observed for the
other 59 tested patients. These results to date cannot be
treated as the exclusion of a m u t a t i o n in exon 21 of these
patients. Based on our results with exon 11 (Plieth et al.
1992), however, the likelihood for the existence of such
a m u t a t i o n has b e e n lowered drastically and further mutations should be searched for elsewhere.
D o c k h o r n - D w o r n i c z a k et al. (1991) have previously
shown that D N A - S S C P can indeed be p e r f o r m e d without isotopes. These authors used a silver-staining procedure to visualize the D N A ; this m e t h o d is m o r e sensitive, but at the same time, m o r e laborious to perform
than ethidium b r o m i d e staining. The m e t h o d described
here is p r o b a b l y the best available c o m p r o m i s e between
detection potential and practicability.

strand of the patient's father. The first heterozygous signal resulting from the frameshift is indicated by the arrow

quences published by Zielenski et al. (1991), to m e e t the
following conditions: (1) the p r o d u c e d fragments should
be short because of the intrinsic limitations of SSCP analysis; (2) the target sequence should comprise the entire
exon plus at least 6 adjacent intronic bases in o r d e r to
cover the majority of expected splice site mutations; (3)
the two oligonucleotides should have a c o m p a r a b l e G / C
content. Since point (3) could not be met simultaneously
with point (1), one of the oligonucleotides ( E x 2 1 S S C P F) was extended to c o m p e n s a t e for the lower G/C content.
A f t e r the establishment of P C R and electrophoresis
conditions using the N 1303K m u t a t i o n ( O s b o r n e et al.
1991; Bal et al, 1992) as a detection control, we screened
60 patients with u n k n o w n mutations for alterations within exon 21 and adjacent bases. Figure 1 shows the detection of an SSCP variation in one of these patients. Sequence analysis of the amplified exon 21 fragment revealed a deletion of a single A residue in a stretch of 6 A
residues covering c D N A positions 4035-4040 (Fig. 2).
This deletion was f o u n d on both strands and in the father
of the patient, but not in the patient's m o t h e r , who earlier was shown to be heterozygous for A F 5 0 8 , as was her
son. N o further sequence deviation was found. T h e observed frameshift deletion results in a Stop codon at amino
acid position 1327. A n y position within the stretch of 6 A
residues might have been deleted. F o r the p r o p o s e d nomenclature, the first of these bases within the c D N A was
selected. A possible mechanism of m u t a t i o n might be
misalignment during replication (Krawczak and C o o p e r
1991).
