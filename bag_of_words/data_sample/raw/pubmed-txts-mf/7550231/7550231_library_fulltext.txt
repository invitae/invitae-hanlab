Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 (CMT1) disease is an autosomal dominant neuropathy of the peripheral
nerve. The majority of CMT 1 cases are due to a duplication of an 1.5-Mb DNA fragment on
chromosome 17pl1.2 (CMT la). Micromutations were found in the gene for peripheral myelin protein
22 (PMp22) located in the duplicated region of CMT la, and in the peripheral myelin protein zero
(PO) located on chromosome lq21-23 (CMT Ib). We have characterized two new mutations in the
PO gene in two french families presenting CMT disease. Both mutations occur in the extracellular
domain of the PO protein. One mutation is a de novo mutation and is from paternal origin.

INTRODUCTION
Charcot-Marie-Tooth(CMT)neuropathy is the
most common inherited peripheral neuropathy
with an incidence of 1 in 2,500 (Skre, 1974). The
disease is clinically caracterized by distal muscle
weakness, pes cavus, atrophy, absent or diminished tendon reflexes, and mild sensory loss. CMT
type 1 shows largely reduced motor nerve conduction velocities (NCV) of less than 38 d s e c and on
biopsy the presence of onion bulbs formed by a
process of de- and remyelinization. CMT type 2 is
a nondemyelinating neuropathy with normal or
slightly reduced NCV values. The genetic heterogeneity of the disease is important. For the autosoma1 dominant forms, loci have been identified
on chromosome 17 (CMT la) (Vance et al.,
1991), on chromosome 1 (CMT lb) (Bird et al.,
1982)’ and evidence exists for the occurence of
another yet unknown locus (CMT lc) (Chance et
al., 1990). The gene responsible for CMT type l a
codes for PMP22 and is either present in an

(Matsunami et al., 1992; Patel et al., 1992; Valentijn et al., 1992a; Timmerman et al., 1992) or
exceptionally altered by point mutations (Valentijn et al., 1992b).
CMT type l b was initially mapped to the pericentromeric region of chromosome l (Bird et al.,
1982) and later on localized more precisely to
lq21-23 (Lebo et al., 1991). This region contains a gene coding for the major peripheral protein zero (Pham-Dinhet al., 1993), and mutations
in this gene have been reported (Table 1). We
here describe a leucine for serine substitution at
amino acid position 78 and a de novo mutation
consisting of a cysteine substitution for tryptophane at amino acid position 101.

These mutations have been described in association with a Dejerine-Sottas phenotype (Hayasaka et al., 1993d).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Population Selection
Blood samples were obtained from CMT families from all over France. Families corresponding to
CMTl criteria (de Visser, 1993) were screened systematically for the presence of the duplication on
chromosome 17 with probe pVAW409R3a
(D17S122) and the combined probes pEW401HE
(D17S61) and pVAW412HEc (D17S125) (Raeymaekers et al., 1992). Ten nonduplicated families
were further screened using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis for the
presence of point mutations in the exons 2, 3 , and
6 of the PO gene.
Amplification of DNA Sequences and
SSCP Analysis
DNA samples were prepared by standard phenol-chloroform extractions. Conditions for amplification, sequence of oligonucleotide primers for
exons 2, 3, and 6, and conditions for SSCP were as
described by Nelis et al. (1994a).
Sequencing
Genomic DNA (500 ng) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 2 p,M of each
primer in a total volume of 50 p1. PCR amplification was performed with Thermus aquaticus DNA
polymerase from Perkin-Elmer (Cetus, Norwalk,
CT) under conditions specified by the supplier.
Oligonucleotide primers were designed according
to the genomic sequence of PO (Pham-Dinh et al.,
1993). The primers used were (5’ 3’): GATCTCACTTCCTCTGTATCC (sense) and GA-

CCCTAATGAGAACACAGC (antisense) for
exon 2 and GCTGTGTTCTCATTAGGGTC
(sense) and GCCAGCAGTACCGAACCAC
(antisense) for exon 3. After a predenaturation
step of 4’ at 93”C, 33 cycles of amplification (40”
at 94”C, 1‘ at 59”C, and 2’ at 74°C) and one
polymerization step of 5’ at 74°C were performed.
Fragments obtained presented a length of 540 and
607 base pairs (bp), respectively, for exons 2 and
3. Before sequencing, amplified DNA was extracted with chloroform and purified by the Geneclean procedure (BiolOl, La Jolla CA). Exon sequencing was performed directly on purified PCR
products (Higuchi et al., 1988) or on Bluescript
(Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA) subcloned inserts (Sequenase, United States Biochemicals) (Hattori and Sakaki, 1986).
RESULTS
Clinical Findings

In family 1 (Fig. l ) , two individuals are affected
in a three generation pedigree. Both parents of the
propositus are clinically unaffected. The age of the
father and the mother at time of birth of the propositus was, respectively, 25 and 19 years. The
propositus 11.3, 32 years old, had early onset of the
disease at the age of walking. Atrophy of the distal
lower limb muscles and absence of muscle stretch
reflexes in lower and upper limbs were observed.
The patient presents a pes c a w s deformity of the
feet with hammertoes and a scoliosis. T h e median
NCV is lowered to 10 m/sec. The nerve biopsy
presents many onion bulbs. The daughter of the

propositus (111.1) is 7 years old. She has walking
difficulties and a pes cavus deformity of the foot.
Individuals from four different generations of
family 2 were studied (Fig. 2). The propositus 11.1,
57 years old, has a slow progression of the disease,
median NCVs of 15 and 21 m/sec (left and right),
and had a nerve biopsy showing many onion bulbs.
Her mother, I. 1, underwent seven surgical operations of the feet. Her daughter had also an operation to correct feet deformities. Nerves of the latter
could not be stimulated to measure median NCVs,
but cubital values for the upper limbs were 34 and
3 1 m/sec (left and right).
Detection of the Mutations With

SSCP Analysis

Figures 1 and 2 present the aberrant profiles of
migration detected with SSCP analysis. The amplified fragments are 290 nucleotides in length for
exon 2 and 370 nucleotides in length for exon 3. A
conformation polymorphism was detected in exon
3 without glycerol (family l), and in exon 2 in the
presence of 10% glycerol (family 2). Only affected
members of the family showed the presumed mutation. N o mutations were found for exon 6.
Sequencing

The sequencing of exon 3 in family 1 revealed
the presence of a mutant allele, a G to C trans-

version, leading to a cysteine substitution for tryptophane at amino acid position 101. Intron 2 of
the PO gene contains a polymorphic oligo( T ) tract
(Pham-Dinh et al., 1993), permitting retracing of
the parental origin of the mutation present in exon
3. Using primers for sequencing exon 2, DNA fragments spanning the polymorphism and the mutation are obtained. Fragments from the father,
mother and the affected daughter were cloned and
sufficient clones were sequenced to identify both
alleles of each individual (not shown) revealing
the point mutation to be present o n the paternal
allele.
In family 2, the mutation in exon 2 is a C to T
transition resulting in a leucine substitution for
serine at amino acid position 78.
In both families, affected persons were heterozygous for the mutant allele and the normal allele.
The mutation was absent in the DNA from unaffected persons and the other regions of exon 2 or 3,
including exon-intron boundaries, had normal sequences.

DISCUSSION

We screened 10 patients corresponding to the
criteria of CMT 1 and showing no duplication of
chromosome 17~11.2,for the presence of micromutations in exons 2, 3, and 6 of the PO gene.
Exons 2 and 3 were chosen, as they code for the
largest part of the extracellular domain of the protein, and since the majority of the mutations reported so far (12 of the 15) are located in this

CMT 1B POINT MUTATIONS

domain (Table 1). Exon 6 was also analyzed for
practical reasons since the conditions for amplification were the same as for exons 2 and 3. We
found two novel mutations in the PO gene associated with CMT lb. Both mutations affect the extracellular domain of PO, which is responsible for
the homophilic adhesion properties of the protein.
Most of the mutations known so far occur in this
region (12 of the 15 so far known). The extracellular domain of PO has a structure related to the
reiterated conserved domains of the immunoglobulin superfamily. These molecules serve as recognition molecules by binding either homotypically
or to another immunoglobulin-related structure
(Lemke, 1992). Probably, missense mutations in
the extracellular domain alter the capacity to interact correctly, thereby disturbing the compaction
of the myelin sheets. The extracellular domain
contains two cysteine residues at amino acid positions 50 and 127, creating a loop characteristic of
the immunoglobulin-like structure of PO. For family 1, the presence of a third cysteine in the extra
cellular domain of PO could compete with the formation of the correct disulfide bond, resulting in a
change of conformation and a bad adhesion between successive myelin layers. No alterations for
exon 6 were found, although a low-frequency neutral polymorphism in this exon was reported (Nelis
et al., 1994a). Further screening for exons 1, 4,
and 5 will be necessary to find other mutations or
to exclude the occurence of mutations in PO in the
other families. However, we cannot entirely exclude the presence of mutations that are not detected with the SSCP technique. Also, these families are too small to prove the involvement of a
locus in the pathology by linkage studies.
Family 1 presents a de novo mutation, with
clinically unaffected parents in the first generation. SSCP and sequencing did not reveal the presence of the mutation in the parental DNA. Correct paternity was proven with probe YNH24
(D2S44) and the polymorphic poly( T) tract in intron 2 in the PO gene (Pham-Dinh et al., 1993).
The latter allowed us to conclude to a paternal
origin of the mutation. De novo mutations for
CMT 1 disease are known to occur for the duplication on chromosome 17 (Hoogendijk et al.,
1992) and concern about 10% of affected families
(unpublished results). Interestingly, most of these
mutations are of paternal origin (Palau et al.,
1993). However, the mechanism of mutation is
different, since the duplication is believed to be
due to an unequal recombination event during
meiosis. It remains to be determined whether point

53

mutations as described here for the PO gene also
show preferential paternal origin.
