Key Words. Werner's syndrome • Premature aging syndromes • Genodermatology
Abstract. 7 cases of Werner's syndrome in one family of northern Sardinia (the
female : male ratio being 4:3) are reported. A 9-year-old girl affected with Cooley's
anemia is reported too. The typical complete pattern of the syndrome was observed in
patients in the fourth decade of their lives, whereas in the two youngest ones, some
features were missing. I patient died of gastric carcinoma, 1 of cachexia. Consanguinity
was established in two generations. The genealogical tree suggests an autosomal recessive
mode of inheritance. Genealogical, clinical, biochemical, and histopathological studies
were performed. As far as we know, this is the largest number of patients with Werner’s
syndrome reported in one family.

Werner’s syndrome, formerly described as ‘scleroderma associated with
cataract’ [16] is at present included among the premature aging syndromes
[2, 6, 16].
The condition is characterized [12, 14] by shortness of stature, juvenile
cataracts, premature canities or baldness, vascular changes, osteoporosis,
cutaneous, subcutaneous and aduexial involvement, soft tissue calcification,
trophic leg ulcers, high-pitched voice, metabolic and endocrine disorders
(glucose intolerance, hyperlipoproteinemia, hypogonadism and hypo­
pituitarism), frequent familial incidence.
The first cases reported by Werner [16] in 1904 were 4 siblings; Kansky
and Franzot [9] described 3 cases in one family; Nazzaro et al. [11] 2 cases;
Many et al. [10] 2 cases, and Aram and Fatourecbi [1] 2 cases. ‘Formes
frustes’ have also been observed in families with typical cases of Werner’s
syndrome [3], and atypical forms have also been described [8]. In most of

the cases of Werner’s syndrome so far described (about 130), no family
history was found; however, consanguinity of the parents has been fully
established in 24 familial cases [9]. The present paper describes 7 cases of
Werner’s syndrome in one family.
Case Report
Family History
The genealogical tree of the family (fig. 1) suggests an autosomal recessive hetero­
zygote mode of inheritance; this is in agreement with most authors’ opinion. All of the
affected members live in the same small rural center where most of the inhabitants are
consanguineous and even have the same surname. The parents as well as the grandparents
of one of the affected members (case 3) were first cousins. Four generations were investi­
gated, all of our cases being members of the third and fourth generations. However,
nobody in the first and second generations presented any signs of the disease, to the
knowledge of the still living members of the family. In a 46-year-old female, an incomplete
syndrome was observed since only premature canities and short stature were present.
A 9-year-old girl was affected with Cooley's anemia.
There were 4 female and 3 male patients ranging in age from 28 to 55. The clinical
details arc reported in table I. Figures 2 and 3 show the clinical appearance of 2 of the
reported patients.
Laboratory Findings
On histological examination, the epidermis of the affected members was atrophic
and the dermis showed thin and atrophic fibers with normal tinctorial reactions. No

homogenization of dermal collagen was present, the vessels being normal. Biochemical
analysis of the involved skin revealed an increase in hexosamines and hydroxyproline of
various degrees in all the patients.
Serum glucosamine was within the normal limits and urinary excretion of muco­
polysaccharides was normal. Urinary excretion of gonadotropins, FSH, 17-KS was within
the normal range. No dysfunction in thyroid, parathyroid, pituitary or adrenal glands was
evidenced; chromosome studies are in progress. The attempts to demonstrate occurrence
of ANA proved negative.

In all the patients, short stature, slender extremities with stocky trunk,
muscle atrophy, juvenile cataracts and some degree of hypogonadism were
present. However, several of the features regarded as typical of the syndrome,
namely aged facial appearance, trophic ulcers, high-pitched voice, diabetes
mellitus and hyperkeratoses are lacking in the 2 youngest subjects.
According to the personal histories of the patients observed, there is
evidence that the affected subjects develop the single features in a fairly

constant age sequence [4]. In the second decade of life, the patients showed
shortness of stature and hypogonadism. In the third decade of life, bilateral
cataracts and canities occurred. In the fourth decade, the patients showed
premature aging, wrinkling of the skin, high-pitched voice, diabetes mellitus,
osteoporosis, trophic ulcers of the legs, hyperkeratoses on the bony promi­
nences of soles and atrophy of muscles.
At the age of 40, we observed a complete clinical pattern in 4 subjects.
2 of the patients developed typical basal cell carcinomas. 1 patient developed
gastric carcinoma at the age of 38 and died at 40. Another died of cachexia
at the age of 55.
The findings suggest that Werner’s syndrome cannot be considered a
kind of scleroderma either clinically or histopathologically. In fact, the skin
in Werner’s syndrome is thin and freely movable [7] whereas in scleroderma
it is thickened and unmovable. No hyalinization of dermal collagen and
dermal blood vessels, typical of scleroderma,is present in Werner’s syndrome.
In view of the clinical appearance of the affected patients, Werner’s
syndrome has been connected with premature aging and has even been
defined as a ‘caricature of ageing’ [4]. A morphological approach to the
problem has, however, been made by Sleeker and Gardner [13]. Their studies,
involving cytogenetics and fibroblast culture, support the view that Werner’s
syndrome and the aging process are separate entities. Fraccaro el al. [5] could
not demonstrate chromosome abnormalities in Werner’s syndrome. Our
observations support these points of view.
According to the above-mentioned authors, Werner’s syndrome is
probably due to an inborn error of connective tissue metabolism, although
further research needs to be carried out in order to elucidate the enzymatic
defect underlying the degenerative pathology of this syndrome.
