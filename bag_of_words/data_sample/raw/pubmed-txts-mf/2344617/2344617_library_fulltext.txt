We have identified
three different point mutations
in
the coding region of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR) gene. Each mutation segregates
with the disease in two- or threegeneration
pedigrees and is not found on the normal
chromosome
of any documented
cystic fibrosis carrier. One of the mutations is found in two independent
families that contain at least one individual with a mild
course of disease. All of these alterations
replace
charged amino acids with less polar residues and are
found in the putative transmembrane
sections of the
molecule. The mutated amino acids are found to be
conserved
in both rodents and amphibians
and lie in
a region of CFTR that is believed to form a channel in
the membrane.
Although
these alterations
are rare,
they provide important clues to functionally
important
regions of the molecule.
Introduction
Although cystic fibrosis (CF) has affected humans for
generations, this disease was not clinically recognized as
a distinct entity until the 1930s. Dorothy Andersen (1938)
correctly proposed that the intestinal disorders and vitamin A deficiencies seen in these patients were due to the
degeneration
of the pancreas. Pedigree analysis has established CF as an autosomal recessive disorder (Andersen and Hodges, 1947), and di Sant’Agnese et al. (1953)
observed that CF patients secrete an excess of sodium
and chloride ions in their sweat. This observation led to
the development of the sweat iontophoresis test, which remains the differential diagnostic indicator of CF (Gibson
and Cooke, 1959).

Several reports have documented a defect in the regulation of chloride ion transport of CF epithelial cells from tissue, primary culture, and immortalized cells (Knowles et
al., 1981; Quinton and Bijman, 1983; Sato and Sato, 1984;
Welsh and Liedkte, 1986). The chloride channel in normal
cells is activated by f3-adrenergic agents through the
production of intracellular CAMP (Quinton, 1983; Knowles
et al., 1983; Sato and Sato, 1984). Although CF cells can
be shown to produce CAMP in response to such agents,
the channels are not activated. However, chloride transport can be measured in CF cells in response to membrane depolarization
or through stimulation of protein kinase C in the presence of calcium (Frizzell et al., 1986; Li
et al., 1989; Hwang et al., 1989). Therefore, the CF defect
may disrupt a pathway whereby CAMP regulates ion transport, but no defective protein has been identified in CF
cells to date.
The clinical presentation of CF is variable both between
and within families (Rosenstein and Langbaum, 1984).
The majority of patients are diagnosed by the time of
adolescence, but a few individuals remain undiagnosed
until the ages of 30-65 (di Sant’Agnese and Davis, 1979;
Su and Beanblossom,
1989). Severe, classical CF is
characterized by abnormalities of the intestine (obstructions, i.e., meconium ileus), lungs (infections), pancreas
(failure to secrete digestive enzymes), and the reproductive organs (azo-ospermia,
low female fertility) (Rosenstein and Langbaum, 1984). If untreated, the average age
of survival is 3-5 years. In contrast, the average lifespan
of patients receiving optimum treatment (antibiotics, digestive enzymes, and respiratory therapy) is 25-30 (Boat
et al., 1989). Virtually all patients develop pulmonary damage due to colonization of the lung with antibiotic-resistant
bacteria.
A milder form of the disease has been documented in
100/o-15% of patients, in which pancreatic function is less
abnormal and the requirement for pancreatic enzymes is
absent or reduced. These patients are described as pancreatic sufficient (PS) (Gaskin et al., 1982). Durie et al.
(1986) have demonstrated that PS patients have higher
levels of serum trypsinogen.
Direct measurement
has
shown increased levels of exocrine enzymes in PS patients (Kopelman et al., 1985). PS is typically concordant
within families, and these patients have different haplotypes for closely linked markers when compared with
more severely affected patients (Gasparini et al., 1990;
Kerem et al., 1989a; this report). This genetic information
suggests that PS patients have less severe mutations in
the CF gene.
CF is the most common fatal genetic disease in Caucasians, with a carrier frequency of 1 in 25 (Rosenstein and
Langbaum,
1984). The availability of three-generation
families with multiple affected offspring made CF a prime
candidate for the application of linkage analysis and molecular genetics for the cloning of the gene (reviewed in
Dean, 1988). A series of reports published in 1985 demonstrated that the CF gene was located on the long arm of

DNA from several CF patients who are not homozygous

chromosome 7 (Tsui et al., 1985; White et al., 1985; Dean
et al., 1985; Wainwright et al., 1985). Multipoint linkage
analysis placed the gene between the met proto-oncogene and the anonymous marker D7S8 (Beaudet et al.,
1986; Lathrop et al., 1988). The region containing the gene
was refined by cloning CpG-rich islands of DNA, chromosome jumping and walking, and mapping of recombinant
meioses (Estivifl et al., 1987; lannuzzi et al., 1989; Dean
et al., 1990). The CF gene was isolated in 1989, from lung
cell and sweat duct cDNA libraries, and shown to encode
an approximately 170 kd protein related to a family of membrane-bound active transport molecules (Rommens et al.,
1989; Riordan et al., 1989; Kerem et al., 1989b). A three
nucleotide deletion in a putative ATP binding domain is
found in 70% of CF chromosomes. This mutation occurs
in the tenth exon of the gene and removes a phenylalanine
codon at position 508 (AFso8) in a putative ATP binding
domain.
Results
Identification
of Patients Carrying
Nucleotide
Alterations
We have employed a sensitive assay to examine a group
of patients who do not contain the common mutation on
one or both chromosomes in an attempt to identify additional mutations in the gene. Orita et al. (1989a, 1989b) recently described a technique that detects point mutations
in defined stretches of DNA. This method identifies singlestranded conformation polymorphisms
(SSCPs), by the
amplification
of 100-400 bp segments of radiolabeled
DNA, which are subsequently denatured and electrophoresed on high resolution, nondenaturing
acrylamide gels.
Under these conditions each strand of the DNA fragment
can fold back on itself in a unique conformation. Mutations
within a DNA segment will often alter the secondary structure of the molecule and affect its electrophoretic mobility.
We have used SSCP analysis for 46 CF patients who
have at least one CF allele that does not contain the com-

mon (AF,& mutation. We designed primers to amplify
coding regions of the gene from the published sequence
of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR). Speculating that the transmembrane
regions
may be sites for mutations, we chose the larger exons in
the regions of the gene containing the putative membranespanning domains for study. Figure 1 shows an SSCP
analysis of exons 4 and 7 performed on several patients.
One individual can be identified, for each exon, that contains an aberrantly migrating fragment. Of the 46 patients
examined, three patients were identified with alterations in
exon 4. Only one individual was found with an exon 7 alteration.
Each putative mutation was shown to segregate with the
disease in the families of these patients (Figure 2). Each
of the exon 4 and 7 aberrant fragments occurred on a CF
chromosome that does not contain the AFso8 mutation.
The alterations were more precisely mapped to determine
whether the individuals with aberrant exon 4 fragments all
carry the same mutation. The alteration in pedigree BOS
7 mapped to a different region of exon 4 than did the UT
1425 or the BOS 42 mutation, and the fragments migrated
to a different position on the SSCP gels (data not shown).
This suggested that the exon 4 alterations are due to at
least two independent mutations in the three families.
Nucleotide
Sequences
of the Alterations
The amplified DNA was directly sequenced in order to determine the nucleotide changes responsible for the mobility shifts. In each case we obtained a single ladder of DNA
sequence that exactly matched the published sequence
at all but a single nucleotide position (Figures 3 and 4). Individuals from pedigree UT 1425 and BOS 42 showed the
identical mutation, a G to A transition at nucleotide 482 in
exon 4. This mutation changes an arginine codon to histidine; it will be referred to as R117H. The mutation in BOS
7 is a C to G transversion in exon 4 that replaces an aspartic acid residue with histidine (DllOH). Family UT 1446
contains a C to G transversion
at position 1172 that
changes an aspartic acid residue to proline (R347P). This
latter mutation destroys an Hhal restriction site and creates an Ncol site. Thus each of the nucleotide sequence
alterations that we detected by the SSCP method does in
fact result in an amino acid replacement in the CFTR
gene.
All amino acid changes in polypeptides do not result in
functional alterations. To provide further evidence that
these mutations cause disease, we analyzed 86 two- and
three-generation
CF families to determine if these alterations occur on normal chromosomes.
Because CF is a
common recessive disease, only normal chromosomes
from documented carriers can be used as a source of
non-CF alleles. Since the carriers are healthy, they must
possess a normal chromosome. None of the exon 4 or 7
mutations were found in greater than 272 normal chromosomes from carrier parents and grandparents. A more rigorous test would employ the examination of sufficient normal chromosomes of the same haplotype as the mutant
allele to ensure that the mutation was not a neutral sequence polymorphism occurring on a rare haplotype. All

Displayed are the pedigrees
of the families in which alterations
in exon 4 and 7 were discovered.
Females are represented
as circles, males as
squares. Affected individuals are shown as filled symbols and carriers as half-filled symbols, Children are displayed with the oldest on the left. Below
each individual is the haplotype for several polymorphic
markers tightly linked to the CF gene. 1 represents
the larger allele, allele 1; 2, allele 2.
The vertical line separates
the maternal haplotype on the left from the paternal haplotype.
F508 indicates the phenylalanine
508 deletion; CFX4
and CFX7, exon 4 and 7. The plus signs represent wild-type sequence;
minus signs refer to mutations. (A) BOS 42, from left to right affected individuals
are 525, 526, and 527. (B) UT 1425, affected patients are 1376, 1377, 1368, 1379, and 1380. (C) SOS 7, CF patient is 150. (D) UT 1446, patients are

of the mutations occur on haplotypes that contain the
larger fragment (allele 1) for the KM19 and MP6d polymorphisms (Figure 2). These restriction fragment length polymorphisms are in tight linkage disequilibrium
with each
other (A = 0.85; Estivill et al., 1987). In addition, they show
a high allelic association with CF (A = 0.77-0.88; Kerem
et al., 1989a). For all three mutations, we analyzed a -/fold
excess of normal versus CF chromosomes-a
statistically
significant number (Table 1). As further evidence that the
mutated amino acids are functionally important, we exam-

ined the conservation of these regions across several vertebrate species. Using the same polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and amplification conditions employed
for human DNA, we obtained pure, correctly sized product
from most species tested (data not shown). We directly
sequenced the DNA from the most divergent species,
mouse and frog (Xenopus), using the exon 7 primers (Figure 48). The two assayed regions are remarkably conserved, displaying over 90% identity at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels. The Arg residue, altered in CF,

is conserved in both the rodent and amphibian sequences.
The sequence for exon 4 was not obtained for mouse and
frog, but the Asp-110 and Arg-117 residues are conserved
in several mammalian species (data not shown). These
data strongly suggest that these amino acids play a critical role in the structure and/or function of CFTR. Therefore, we conclude that the mutations we have described
cause disease, although additional population data and a
functional assay for the gene will be required to demonstrate this rigorously.

Even though there are no physical data on the structure
of the CFTR protein, its similarity to other members of the
membrane transport family strongly suggests that this
protein is embedded in the plasma membrane. Although
few membrane proteins have actually been crystallized,
transmembrane
segments are generally thought to consist of approximately 20 amino acids arranged in an a helix. A number of computer algorithms have been developed that employ the hydrophobicity of portions of amino
acids to predict the presence of transmembrane
domains
(Eisenberg, 1984; Engelman et al., 1986). Two of the mutations described here replace highly polar amino acids in
a domain that is predicted to lie outside of the cell (Riordan
et al., 1989). This region of 15 residues contains 7 charged
amino acids and would be unlikely to lie within the membrane (Figure 4). The third change (CF R347P) replaces
an arginine with a proline residue. This amino acid is
predicted to lie inside of the sixth transmembrane segment.
The function of the CFTR molecule is still unclear. Although the defective transport of chloride ions is the most
well characterized abnormality in CF epithelial cells, aberrant transport of sodium, bicarbonate, and sulfated molecules have also been seen in CF cells and tissues
(Boucher et al., 1988; Kopelman et al., 1989). Furthermore, a chloride transport complex has been purified from
bovine cells and appears to be composed of multiple polypeptides that are smaller than CFTR (Landry et al., 1989).
All of the genes related to CFTR encode proteins involved

fected. In family UT 1425, the three older affected children
remained undiagnosed
until the two younger siblings
were determined to have CF at the ages of 22 and 23. In
the BOS 42 family, one of the affected patients (#2) is 26
years old and has a very mild disease phenotype. Thus
the two families with the same pair of mutations (AF508
and CF R117H) both contain at least one individual with
exceptionally mild disease.
Discussion
Using a rapid and sensitive assay we have identified three
point mutations that cause amino acid replacements in
the coding region of the N-terminal portion of the CFTR
gene. Three observations support the proposition that
these mutations are responsible for disease: the mutations have not been found on over 94 normal chromosomes of the same haplotype; the mutations cause the
replacement of highly charged amino acids that are highly
conserved in vertebrates; and two families that carry the
same combination of mutations (AFSo8 and CF R117H)
show mild clinical features.

in extracellular transport, although none of these polypeptides are involved in ion flux. Thus it is still unclear
whether CFTR transports chloride ions or whether it regulates chloride flux in a less direct fashion.
There are several possible mechanisms that could explain the effect of the mutations described here on the CF
gene. The charged side chains that are replaced could be
involved in interactions with the molecule being transported by the channel; the mutations could cause structural alterations in the protein; the replaced residues may
be involved in interactions with other proteins; or they
could be critical for the proper anchoring of the transmembrane domains in the membrane. The examination of the
ion transport properties of cells from these patients should
help distinguish these possibilities.
We identified different mutations in two of the four families that have at least one individual characterized as PS.
Thus there would appear to be at least three mutations
that are responsible for this milder form of the disease, although all four families have a haplotype with the one allele for MPGd (Table 3). However, family BOS 42 clearly
demonstrates that other factors (genetic and/or environmental) must play a role in the course of the disease. The
oldest child in this family has severe, chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of the lung resulting in moderately abnormal pulmonary function and mild pancreatic
and liver disease. In contrast, her younger sister at age 26
has virtually no signs of CF, apart from an elevated sweat
chloride level. The more severely affected child also has
a much higher sweat chloride value, suggesting that other
genes participate in the control of ion transport.
The mutations we have described here are rare and
may each account for only 1% or 2% of CF chromosomes.
However, these mutations could be more frequent in more
geographically
restricted populations. A consortium of 41
laboratories from 14 countries has been formed, with a
combined patient base of over 9,000, to provide accurate
population data on CF mutations. The R347P mutation
can be directly assayed by restriction digestion and the
others by allele-specific oligonucleotides.
All of the families in this study are of Caucasian origin.
The paternal grandfather of UT 1446 is of German/French
extraction. The father of BOS 7 is of Irish/English descent.
We do not know the ethnic background of the other families Given the large size of the CF gene and the presence
of deletions (Riordan et al., 1989), frameshift mutations
(White et al., 1990), and point mutations (this report) in
both the transmembrane
and intracellular portions of the
molecule, it seems likely there will be a large number of
CF mutations. This may make it more difficult to screen
for all of the mutations in large populations of patients.
The AFso8 mutation accounts for approximately 70% of
CF chromosomes, and about one-half of CF patients are
homozygous for this mutation (Kerem et al., 1989b; Lemna
et al., 1990; Dean et al., submitted). Therefore, at least
40% of patients are likely to be compound heterozygotes.
CF patients heterozygous for AFso8 demonstrate a broad
range of severity and include both pancreatic insufficient
and PS cases. The two families with the R117H mutation
provide a clear example that clinical characterization
of

each combination of compound heterozygote may be important in predicting the severity of individual patients.
It is unclear what the symptoms of a homozygote for the
mutations described here would be. Such an individual
could go undiagnosed or could present mild pulmonary,
fertility, and/or pancreatic complications. The identification of these mild variants will allow this to be tested
directly. Many techniques exist for detecting point mutations in nucleic acids, but SSCP analysis has many advantages. Samples are taken directly from the thermal
cycler to electrophoresis
on easily prepared gels. No extensive treatment of the sample or special equipment is
required as in other methods. While no information on the
position of the mutation is obtained and the fragments
should be less than 400 bp, the amplified product can be
digested to further localize the mutation. It is uncertain
what percentage of mutations will be detected by this
method. Orita et al. (1989b) were able to detect all four ras
mutations that they directly assayed as well as a mutation
of an Mspl site. While all three mutations described here
represent replacements of G residues, Orita et al. (1989b)
detected A to T, C to A, G to A, G to T, and C to T mutations.
Single nucleotide deletions can also be detected as
SSCPs (M. Dean and M. White, unpublished data). This
method should be applicable to any source of nucleic
acid, including viruses, plasmids, and tumors. Because
the assay is for aberrantly migrating strands, mixed cell
populations such as tumors infiltrated with normal cells
could be assayed.
It was recently proposed that a data base should be
generated of small stretches of human DNA segments defined by PCR primers (sequence-tagged
sites) in order to
facilitate the physical mapping of the genome (Olson et
al., 1989). Sequence-tagged
sites should be readily amenable to SSCP analysis, and the detection of polymorphisms in them would allow physical maps of the human
genome to be combined with the genetic maps.
Experimental

Procedures

Identification
of SSCPs
PCRs were performed
with 100 ng of genomic DNA, 70 mM dNTPs,
0.1 pl of [32P]dCTP (3000 Cilmmol), 10 mM Tris (pli 8.8), 50 mM KCI,
1.5 mM MgQ,
0.01% gelatin, and 1 U of Taq polymerase.
For exon 4,
primers CF-32 (5’-AGTCACCAAAGCAGTACAGC)
and CF-33 (5’-GCTATTCTCATCTGCATTCC)
were used, and CF-34 (5’CAGAACTGAAACT.
GACTCGG)
and CF-35 (5’TGCTCCAAGAGAGTCATACC)
were used to
amplify exon 7. The reaction (1 ~1) was added to sequencing
stop solution (9 ~1) (Sambrook
et al., 1989) in a 96-well tray and placed in a pan
of water that had been heated to boiling. After 2 min the tray was removed to room temperature
and 2 ~1 loaded onto 5% acrylamide-TEE
gels at 50 W in a cold room for 3 hr. Alternatively,
10% glycerol was
added to the gel, which was run at room temperature
at 20 W for 6 hr.
The gels were dried and autoradiography
was performed,
with an intensifying screen for 12-72 hr. Complete denaturation
was not always
achieved.
To map mutations further, the PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes and electrophoresed
on 20 cm acrylamide
gels. The
gels were stained with ethidium bromide and the bands excised and
soaked in 100 ul of water at 65% for 1 hr. The eluate was dried,
resuspended
in stop solution, and electrophoresed
as described
above.

scribed above and 5 pl was used in a 40 cycle PCR with a 25- to 50-fold
reduction of one of the primers. The resulting single-stranded
DNA was
purified with a Centricon
100 column (Amicon) and 5 pl sequenced
with Sequenase
(U.S. Biochemicals).
Single-stranded
material that
showed a clean band on an acrylamide
gel typically yielded the
clearest sequence. The individuals whose DNA was sequenced
are as
follows: UT 1425, 1376; UT 1446, 1736; BOS 7, 150; BOS 42, 526. Sequence was determined
in both directions for all four individuals. The
R347P mutation was confirmed
by Hhal and Ncol digestion of amplified DNA The DllOH and R117H mutations were confirmed
