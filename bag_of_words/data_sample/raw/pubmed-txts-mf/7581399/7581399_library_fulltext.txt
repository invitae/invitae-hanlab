Mutations of the human androgen receptor gene were identified in five subjects from four families with
androgen insensitivity syndrome. Individual exons of the androgen receptor gene were amplified by the
polymerase chain reaction from genomic D N A and screened for sequence-dependent differences in
their melting characteristics by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. D N A fragments from exons
with altered mobility were sequenced. Four different single nucleotide base substitutions were found
within exons 5,6, and 7 encoding the steroid-binding domain of the androgen receptor. I n one subject
with ambiguous genitalia, amino acid residue 763 was changed from tyrosine to cysteine ( T A C +
TGC; Y763C). Four subjects, including two siblings, had complete androgen insensitivity. In one
subject, residue 779 was changed from arginine to tryptophan (CGC +-IGG; R779W), another
subject (M807V) had a substitution of valine ( G T G ) for methionine ( A T G ) residue at position 807,
and the two siblings (R855C) had a mutation in residue 855 changing arginine (CGC) to cysteine
(TGC).Binding of the synthetic androgen ligand, methyltrienolone (R1881), by the mutant receptor
Y763C was decreased by 54% compared to the normal receptor. Transcriptional activation of a mouse
mammary tumor virus-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (MMTV-CAT) reporter gene by AR mutant
Y763C was negligible at 0.1 n M R1881 and only 55% at 10 nM R1881 when compared to the
maximal response with the normal AR, as assessed by CAT activity. Mutant M807V retained only
22% of normal R1881 binding and mutant R855C was unable to bind the steroid. In accordance with
the steroid binding, transcriptional activation of h4MTV-CAT by M807V rose to only 26% of control
in the presence of 10 nM R1881, a concentration at which R855C remained functionally inactive. In
summary, missense mutations within the exons of the androgen receptor gene encoding the steroidbinding domain of the receptor are common causes of both partial and complete forms of androgen
insensitivity syndrome. o 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

INTRODUCTION
The androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is
an X-linked disorder in 46,XY subjects in whom
normal male sexual differentiation in utero is altered and subsequent neonatal and pubertal virilization is absent or impaired (Brown and Migeon,
1987). Variable phenotypic presentations of AIS
are observed, ranging from completely female external genitalia to male genitalia with hypospadias,
and, on rare occasion, males with azoospermia and
small phallus. AIS is caused by the absence of tar@ 1995 WILEY-LISS. INC.

qualitative alterations in androgen receptor binding activity can usually be demonstrated in cultured genital skin fibroblasts from affected subjects.

MUTATIONS IN AR STEROID-BINDING DOMAIN

More recently, the molecular lesions responsible
for AIS have been identified as a variety of mutations in the androgen receptor gene (Batch et al.,
1992; Brinkman et al., 1992; Brown et al., 1993;
McPhaul et al., 1993; Pinsky et al., 1992). The
greatest number of different mutations so far identified are located within exons encoding the steroid-binding domain of the androgen receptor protein and hence are associated with defective
androgen-binding properties (Brown e t al., 1993;
McPhaul et al., 1992; Pinsky et al., 1992).
We have used specific oligonucleotide primers
and the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the
exons and adjoining intron regions of the human
androgen receptor gene in genomic DNA isolated
from the blood leukocytes of five subjects with the
clinical diagnosis of AIS. Each amplified DNA
fragment was analyzed first by agarose gel electrophoresis to verify its presence and expected size,
and then on denaturing gradient polyacrylamide
gels to compare its melting characteristics and
electrophoretic mobility with that of a known normal or control DNA fragment. Amplified DNA
fragments with altered mobility relative to normal
DNA fragments were subjected to nucleotide sequence determination. Missense mutations within
exons encoding the steroid-binding domain of the
androgen receptor protein were identified in five
subjects from four families.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
These studies were conducted according to a
protocol (RPN 87-10-30-03)approved by the Joint
Commission on Clinical Investigation of the Johns
Hopkins Medical Institutions for studies pertaining
to human investigation.
Subjects

All five subjects were native Brazilians of Hispanic origin. Each had a 46,XY karyotype.
Subject 572 was born with ambiguous external
genitalia. He was reared as a male and is currently
25 years old. Upon examination, he has a 6-cm
phallus, perineal hypospadias, a bifid scrotum with
normally descended testes, and gynecomastia. A
retrograde urethrogram revealed the presence of a
3-cm vaginal pouch. The uterus was absent and
the prostate was small according to ultrasonography. Endocrine evaluation revealed serum concentrations of testosterone of 1100 ng/dl, dihydrotestosterone of 53 ng/dl, LH of 49 mIU/ml, and FSH
of 11 mIU/ml.
Subject 542 is a 20-year-old Caucasian whose sex
of rearing is female. At birth, the external genita-

153

lia appeared entirely female with normal clitoris
and normally located urethra. Evaluation for primary amenorrhea at 15 years of age revealed a serum testosterone concentration of 790 ng/dl with
normal FSH (4.6 mIU/ml) but elevated LH (24
mIU/ml) levels. Pubic hair was sparse and axillary
hair was absent. Surgical exploration of the abdomen showed a complete absence of mullerian derivatives with a vagina of 3 cm depth, ending
blindly. Testes were located in the lower abdomen
with vas deferens appearing to end in a prostatic
utricle.
Subject 566 is an 18-year-old individual with
normal female external genitalia. Internally, there
is a blind ending vaginal pouch and absence of
mullerian structures. Blood testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels were 317 and 5.2 ng/dl, respectively. The serum estradiol concentration was
27 pg/ml. LH and FSH levels were 22.9 and 11.3
mIU/ml, respectively. A t 17 years of age, a gonadectomy was performed and histology showed spermatogenic aplasia and the presence of a cystic dilation of the epididymis o n the left side.
Subjects 567 and 568 are 18- and 16-year-old
siblings, respectively. Each subject has a normal
female external genitalia and a blind ending vaginal pouch. They have a normal brother. In subject
567, the blood testosterone level was 286 ng/dl and
DHT was 22 ng/dl. The LH and FSH concentrations were 32.4 and 16.4 mIU/ml, respectively.
For subject 568, the testosterone and DHT concentrations were 1033 and 59 ng/dl, respectively.
The LH level was elevated (42.7 mIU/ml) and
FSH was normal (13.1 mIU/ml).
Skin biopsies were not obtained from any of
these subjects and therefore androgen receptorbinding activity was not determined in cultured
skin fibroblasts.

DNA Preparations and Polymerase
Chain Reaction
Genomic DNA was isolated as previously described (Brown e t al., 1988) from leukocytes of
blood specimens shipped to Baltimore from Sao
Paolo, Brazil. Individual exons (1-8) of the androgen receptor gene were amplified by PCR
according to Lubahn et al. (1989) except for the 5’
oligonucleotide primers for exon 3, 5’-TTATCAGGTCTATCAACTCTTGT-3’,and exon 4,5‘GATAAATTCAAGTCTCTCTTCCT-3’. Each
5’-oligonucleotide primer contained a 40-bp G-C
clamp preceding the androgen receptor gene specific sequence (Brown e t al., 1990).
The PCR reactions were performed in a final

154

volume of 50 p1 containing 500 ng genomic DNA
and 20 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer. After
an initial denaturing step at 95°C for 5 min, the
temperature of samples was lowered to 72°C and
2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase was added to initiate
the "hot start" PCR protocol. Amplification conditions consisted of one cycle of 95"C, 1 min;
60"C, 2 min; 72"C, 6 min; and 30 cycles of 95"C,
1 min; 60"C, 2 min; 72"C, 3 min; followed by a
final extension step at 72°C for 10 min.
DNA products of the correct size were verified
by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel with +X174 HaeIII digested DNA as a size standard. The
gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV illumination.
Denaturing Gradient Polyacrylamide Gel
Electrophoresis and Direct DNA Sequencing
Amplified DNA (10 pl aliquot) from affected
and normal subjects was electrophoresed individually or after mixing normal and patient DNA that
had been denatured at 95°C (10 min) and allowed
to reanneal at room temperature. Electrophoresis
was conducted at 60°C in a 6.5% acrylamide gel,
in TAE buffer, with a gradient of increasing concentrations of formamide and urea (i.e., 100% denaturant = 7 M urea/40% formamide) for a total
of 700-1400 V-hr using an apparatus manufactured by CBS Scientific (Del Mar, CA) (Brown et
al., 1990; DeBellis e t al., 1992). The gel was
stained with ethidium bromide and photographed
under UV illumination. The mobility of each
DNA fragment was compared o n the gel relative to
the normal control, using a known mutant as an
internal control for the electrophoretic conditions
of each gel. DNA fragments with altered mobility,
and evidence of heteroduplex formation, were subsequently submitted to direct nucleotide sequence
analysis (Brown et al., 1990). Amplified DNA was
separated from oligonucleotide primers and purified using the Magic PCR Preps DNA purification
system (Promega, Madison, WI) prior to direct sequencing using 32P-labeled oligonucleotide primers
and the T7 DNA polymerase driven dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (Sequenase,
United States Biochemical, Cleveland, OH).
Both the sense and antisense strands were sequenced from two different PCR amplifications of
genomic DNA to confirm each mutation.
Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Each mutation was recreated by site-directed
oligonucleotide mutagenesis using the Altered
Sites in vitro Mutagenesis System (Promega, Mad-

ison WI). A 1.2-kb HindIII fragment of the human
AR cDNA spanning the DNA- and steroid-binding domains was excised from the expression plasmid, p5HEBhAR-1 (Brown et al., 1990), and subcloned into the ampicillin-sensitive plasmid,
PALTER, thus creating PALTER-HhAR. One oligonucleotide containing the desired human AR single nucleotide base mutation and another oligonucleotide conferring ampicillin resistance were
annealed to the single-stranded PALTER-HhAR
as templates for DNA synthesis. The second strand
DNA synthesis reaction was performed in vitro in
the presence of 5 mM each deoxyribonucleotide,
1.5 pg T4 gene 32 DNA-binding protein, 10 U T7
DNA polymerase, and 10 U T4 DNA ligase. The
plasmid was transformed into the repair-deficient
bacterial strain, BMH-7lmutS, and grown overnight in LB media containing 100 pg/ml ampicillin. T h e plasmid was purified from liquid culture
and subsequently transformed into E. coli JM109
and plated on LB-agar containing 100 pg/ml ampicillin. Antibiotic-resistant colonies were selected
and regrown in LB media containing ampicillin.
Plasmid DNA was prepared and sequenced for the
presence of the desired mutation within the AR
cDNA insert. Plasmid DNA with appropriately
mutated sequence was digested with HindIII and
the hAR cDNA fragment was gel purified. The
mutated 1.2-kb HindIII AR cDNA fragment was
ligated into the p5HEBhAR- 1 expression plasmid
in the appropriate orientation and position. The
mutated p5HEBhAR-1 expression vector was subsequently sequenced to verify the presence of each
mutation.
Transient DNA Transfection
Transfection of DNA was performed as previously described (Brown e t al., 1990). Briefly,
COS-7 or CV-1 monkey kidney cells were transfected with the normal or mutated human AR
cDNA expression plasmids, p5HEBhAR-1, using
the calcium phosphate precipitation method. This
expression vector was constructed by placing a
3.1-kb hAR cDNA fragment encoding the fulllength human AR under control of the human
cytomegalovirus promoter in the pCMV5 expression vector (Anderson et al., 1989). As described
below, androgen receptor binding activity was measured 48 hr following transfection into COS-7 cells.
Transcriptional activation of reporter gene activity
in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of steroid, 0.1, 1.0, and 10 nM R1881
(methyltrienolone), was assayed 48 hr after transfection into CV-1 cells. In the latter case, a plasmid

MUTATIONS IN AR STEROID-BINDING DOMAIN

containing the androgen-responsive mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat hormone
response element coupled to the chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase (CAT) gene was also transfected,
and CAT activity was measured (Cato et al., 1987).
All cells were cotransfected with the plasmid vector, pCHl10 (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ)
containing the P-galactosidase gene, as an internal
control for transfection efficiency and as a basis for
normalizing measurements of androgen receptor
binding and CAT activities.
AR Binding Assay

AR binding activity was determined in replicate
plates of DNA-transfected COS-7 cells as previously described (Brown et al., 1990). Cells were
incubated for 2 hr at 37°C in the presence of 5 nM
3H-R1881 (87 Ci/mmol; DupontNEN) in serumfree DMEM. The level of specific radiolabeled steroid binding was normalized for DNA content as
measured by the method of Burton (1956) and corrected for efficiency of DNA transfection according to the P-galactosidase activity in replicate
plates of cells.
Enzyme Assays

Cell extracts (150 p1) were prepared from
DNA-transfected CV-1 cells and stored at -70°C
until time of assay. To measure P-galactosidase activity, 30-50 pl cell extract was incubated at 37°C
with substrate, 0 - N itro- P-D-galactopyranoside, for
0.5-4 hr until the solution became a faint yellow
color (Brown et al., 1990). The difference between the absorbance peak at 420 nm and the
baseline at 550 nm was recorded and the activity
was used as a measure of DNA transfection efficiency to compare results within and between
treatment groups (An et al., 1982).
To measure CAT activity, 50 pl of cell extract
was incubated at 37°C for 3 hr with substrate,
[ ''C]chloramphenicol (dichloroacetyl- 1,2-14C; 54
mCi/mmol; Amersham), and the acetylated-I4C
products were resolved by thin-layer chromatography and detected by subsequent autoradiography
(Gorman et al., 1982). The absolute amounts of
unmetabolized substrate and acetylated products
were determined by cutting the TLC plates and
counting the associated radioactivity corresponding to the autoradiographic images by scintillation
spectrophotometry .
RESULTS

Each of the exons in the human androgen receptor gene of the five subjects included in this

155

study was amplified and determined to be present
and of the expected size. Subsequent denaturing
gradient gel electrophoresis of the PCR-amplified
DNA fragments led to the detection of differences
in relative electrophoretic mobility for each of the
subjects with AIS (Fig. 1). For subject 572, an
altered mobility was observed for the amplified
DNA fragment of exon 5. For subjects 542 and
566, the DNA fragment containing exon 6 displayed an altered mobility and for the siblings, subjects 567 and 568, the migration of the DNA fragment of exon 7 was abnormal. Each of these
putative sequence-dependent differences in electrophoretic mobility was further confirmed by the
appearance of heteroduplex bands which have lowered temperature/denaturant stabilities due to nucleotide base pair mismatches within the (re)annealed DNA fragments.
Exonic DNA fragments showing altered mobility o n DGGE were sequenced in both 5' and 3'
directions and compared with the sequence from
the normal exon fragment. The numbering system
of Lubahn et al. (1989) is used to designate the
relevant amino acid residues of the human androgen receptor as the numbering systems differ
among the published sequences due to variability
in the lengths of the polyglutamine and polyglycine tracts within exon 1. A single nucleotide base
substitution was found in each of four families (Table 1). For subject 572 with partial AIS, an A -+
G nucleotide base change occurred in exon 5 resulting in the substitution of cysteine (TGC) for
the normal residue, tyrosine (TAC), at position
763 (Y763C). In exon 6 of subject 542 with complete AIS, a C + T base substitution occurred to
alter codon 779 from CGG (arginine) to TGG
(tryptophan) (R779W). It should be noted that
the brother of subject 542 who presented with first
degree subcoronal hypospadias, but was otherwise
normal, had a normal androgen receptor gene. In
exon 6 of subject 566 with complete AIS, we
found an A +. G change resulting in the substitution of valine (GTG) for methionine (ATG) at
position 807 (M807V). In the two siblings (567
and 568) with complete AIS, a cysteine residue
was substituted for arginine at position 855
(R855C) due to the mutation of a C -+ T nucleotide in exon 7.
AR binding activity in COS-7 cells transfected
with the normal and mutant AR expression vectors is shown in Figure 2. In cells transfected with
AR mutant Y763C, specific 3H-R1881 binding
was distinctly lower (46% of control) than that in
cells transfected with the normal AR. In cells ex-

pressing the M807V mutant AR, specific binding
of R1881 was present but very low (22% of control), whereas cells expressing the R855C mutant
AR had no steroid binding activity.
CAT activities were measured in CV-1 cells
cotransfected with normal or mutant AR expression vectors and an MMTV-CAT reporter gene
following addition of R1881 over the concentration range of 0.1-10 nM (Fig. 3 ) . AR mutant
Y763C did not activate CAT reporter gene activity at 0.1 nM R1881, but 60- and 85-fold increases
of CAT activity were observed at 1.0 and 10 nM
R1881, respectively. These levels of CAT activity
were equivalent to approximately half of the activity induced by the normal AR at the same concentrations of R1881. AR mutant M807V failed to
stimulate CAT activity at 0.1 nM R1881, but low
levels of CAT activity were induced by 1 (10-fold)
and 10 (40-fold) nM R1881. As to AR mutant
R855C, CAT activity was minimal even with 10

nM R1881.

DISCUSSION
Relationship Between Phenotype and Biological
Activity of the Mutant AR
We report four families who presented a point
mutation of the AR gene resulting in androgen
insensitivity. Clinically, one subject presented a
partial form (subject 572, mutation Y763C).
When the AR gene of this subject was expressed,
the resulting AR protein had SO% of the androgen-binding activity of the wild-type AR, and
transcriptional activation of an androgen-inducible reporter gene was present with R1881 concentrations of 1.0 nM. This mutation in exon 5,
Y763C, was reported previously in a subject with
the “Reifenstein phenotype” but who also had a
truncation of the homopolymeric glutamine segment in exon 1 (McPhaul et al., 1991). By contrast, our subject does not have a truncation of the
polyglutamine segment (data not shown) and
therefore the presentation of ambiguous genitalia is
a manifestation of the amino acid substitution in

tyrosine (Y) and cysteine (C) are both neutral
polar residues, the presence of the more bulky
phenyl group o n tyrosine as compared to the
sulfhydryl of cysteine undoubtedly leads to an effect on the receptor conformation.
The mutations in three other families resulted
in clinically complete androgen insensitivity
(R779W, M807V, and R855C). I t is of interest
that despite similar phenotype, studies with
M807V showed 25% androgen binding activity
whereas R85SC had none. The mutations, R779W
and M807V, are new mutations that have not been
described previously among subjects with androgen
insensitivity. We have not tested the steroid-bind-

ing and transactivation properties of the AR affected by the R779W mutation. The substitution
of valine at residue 807 differs from the arginine
substitution reported by Adeyemo et al. (1993).
The substitution of valine for methionine in our
subject maintains a neutral, hydrophobic residue at
this position whereas arginine is basic. Although
both substitutions, valine or arginine, lead to the
complete form of androgen insensitivity based
upon clinical phenotype, our experimental results
show that M807V retains partial steroid binding
and partial agonist activity, albeit only at higher
than physiologic concentrations of ligand. The
substitution of arginine, M807R, caused absence of
androgen binding and total failure to transactivate
a CAT reporter gene, although binding of the mutated receptor to DNA was normal (Adeyemo et
al., 1993).

McPhaul et al., 1992; Saunders et al., 1992) have
been reported to present 3 different mutations. A
mutation at codon 855 has been reported previously on seven occasions. Three of them were
R855C and our patient, 567, had this same mutation; all four families had complete AIS (DeBellis
et al., 1992; McPhaul et al., 1992; Tincello et al.,
1992). Four other cases were R855H, three of
them being described as partial (Batch et al., 1992;
McPhaul et al., 1992), including one from our
laboratory (Chang et al., 1991), and another as
complete AIS (McPhaul et al., 1992).
A specific mutation which is reported several
times, such as codon 774 R to C (5 cases) (Brown
et al., 1990; Marcelli et al., 1991; Mebarki et al.,
1990; Prior et al., 1992) and codon 840 R to H (5
cases) (DeBellis et al., 1993; Ghirri and Brown,
1993; Hiort et al., 1993; McPhaul et al., 1992;
Pinsky et al., 1992), may also represent hot spots.

FIGURE4. Mutations within exons 5-8 of the human androgen
receptor steroid-binding domain of subjects with androgen
insensitivity. The single letter code for the amino acid sequence of the human androgen receptor is shown in bold
with the known amino acid substitutions shown as the outlined single letter amino acid code either above for cases of
complete androgen insensitivity, or below for cases of partial

androgen insensitivity. An asterisk (*) is used to indicate a
stop codon and the numbers in parentheses refer to the number of individual reports for a given mutation. These data
were compiled from reports in the literature and from the
androgen receptor gene mutation data base established by
Dr. Mark Patterson, Department of Paediatrics, University of
Cambridge, England.

sequence of the steroid binding domain (exons 5 to
8), one finds three Rs in exon 5, four in exon 6,
four in exon 7, and one in exon 8 (Fig. 4). Among
the 12 arginine codons, point mutations have been
reported in 8 of them and our study adds a ninth
case (R779W, subject 542). Five mutated codons,
752, 774, 779, 786, and 831 (Brown et al., 1990,
1992; DeBellis et al., 1992; Marcelli et al., 1991;
McPhaul et al., 1992; Mebarki et al., 1990; Nakao
et al., 1992; Pinsky et al., 1992; Prior et al., 1992)
resulted in complete AIS and three others, 840,
854, and 871 (DeBellis et al., 1993; Ghirri and
Brown, 1993; Hiort et al., 1993; McPhaul et al.,

1992; Pinsky et al., 1992) resulted in partial AIS.
It is of interest to note that when mutant codon
855 encodes a histidine, it gives rise to a partial
form and when it encodes a cysteine it gives rise to
a complete form as in our subject 567. Among the
six arginine residues mutated in cases of AIS, four
of them (752, 774, 831, and 855) are completely
conserved between the androgen, progesterone,
and glucocorticoid receptors and an arginine or
lysine (also basic) are present in the mineralocorticoid and/or estrogen receptors (Fig. 5). However,
at residues 779 and 786, there is a total lack of
amino acid conservation.

FIGURE 5.

Amino acid sequence comparisons of the human
nuclear steroid receptor steroid-bindingdomains. The single
letter codes for the amino acid sequences of the human androgen (hAR), progesterone (hPR), glucocorticoid (hGR),
mineralocorticoid (hMR), and estrogen (hER) receptors are

shown in alignment relative to the exon organization of the
hAR gene. Amino acids known to be mutated in the hAR
gene of subjects with androgen insensitivity (see Fig. 4) are
indicated by an asterisk (*).

The steroid-binding domain of the AR protein
also contains three histidine and twelve lysine residues. Only one mutation of the codons corresponding to these amino acids has been reported
and it results in a stop codon at residue 883 (Trifiro
et al., 1991).
Among point mutations reported to date which
result in codons for amino acids with basic side
chains, there are three giving rise to arginine,
Y739R (Marcelli et al., 1992))W741R (Wilson et
al. , 1992), and M807R (Adeymo et al., 1993). In
each case, the phenotype was that of complete AIS
and the normal amino acid Y, W, or M was completely conserved between the androgen, progesterone, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid receptors (Fig. 5). In four instances, the mutant
amino acid was histidine, the wild-type amino acid
having either arginine, codons 774, 840, and 855,
or proline (P904H) (McPhaul et al., 1992). The
accumulation of data relating to mutations of the
arginine codons in exons 5 to 8 suggests the im-

portance of this basic amino acid for androgen
binding to the AR. Mutations which give rise to
an arginine appear to be as deleterious as those
which replace an arginine by an alternative amino
acid.
Point Mutations Involving Amino Acids With
Acidic Side Chains
The steroid-binding domain includes eight aspartic acid (D) and nine glutamic acid (E) residues. Only three of their respective codons have
been reported to present point mutations, codons
732 (Brown et al., 1992; Pinsky et al., 1992)) 772
(Pinsky et al., 1992; Tincello et al., 1992), and
793 (Pinsky et al., 1992). Two different mutations
at codon 732 (one case of D to N , two cases of D
to Y) resulted in complete AIS phenotype while
two different mutations at codon 772 (E to A, E to
G) resulted in partial AIS. Among five point mutations which gave rise to an acidic amino acid,
two resulted in complete AIS, 750 G to D (Batch

MUTATIONS IN AR STEROID-BINDING DOMAIN

et al., 1992) and 821 V to E (McPhaul et al.,
1992), and three in partial AIS, 748 A to D
(McPhaul et al., 1992), 793 E to D (Pinsky et al.,
1992), and 798 Q to E (Batch e t al., 1992).

Point Mutations Resulting in Stop Codons
In addition to missense mutations, point mutations in six codons of the steroid binding domain
have resulted in stop signals, codon 752 (Brown e t
al., 1992) of exon 5, codons 786 (Pinsky et al.,
1992) and 796 (Marcelli et al., 1990) of exon 7,
codons 831 (DeBellis et al., 1992; Tincello et al.,
1992) and 853 (Wilson e t al., 1992) of exon 7,
and codon 883 (Trifiro et al., 1991) of exon 8. In
all cases, the stop codon resulted in a complete
form of AIS. The stop at codon 883 is closest to
the 3’ end of the coding region and demonstrates
that the last 36 amino acids play a role in steroid
binding which is as important as any earlier deletions of the binding domain. In four cases, the stop
codon replaced a codon for a basic amino acid
(arginine for codons 752, 786, and 831; lysine for
codon 883).
In summary, mutations within the steroid-binding domain of the human androgen receptor are
the most frequent molecular lesions responsible for
androgen insensitivity. Several amino acid residues
may represent “hot spots” for mutation due to their
recurrence in multiple affected families. However,
one must be impressed by the diversity of different
mutations giving rise to the various phenotypes of
partial or complete androgen insensitivity and the
fact that steroid-binding and/or transcriptional activation properties of the mutant androgen receptors depend upon the exact position and amino
acid substitution which occurs.
