deficiency. Both responded to the loading test with tetra- phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase (classic PKU) or by deficiency of

ical cleavage reaction of mismatches in heteroduplexes formed
between normal and patients' RNA (12). After mRNA isolation
from the patients' fibroblasts and cDNA synthesis, the PCR was
used to amplify the coding region of the cDNA. Oligonucleotides
used for the amplification were complementary to the cDNA
from nucleotides 34 to 45 and 784 to 803. The former also
contained a 10-nucleotide tail with a BamHI restriction site.
Hence, all except the first seven of the 244 amino acids were
screened. The mutant PCR product was then screened for mismatches with the wild type cDNA (13).
DHPR activity in erythrocytes was determined by a spectrophotometric measurement of the quinonoid-6-methyldihydropterin-dependent oxidation of ferricytochrome C (14). Cultured
fibroblasts were assayed for DHPR activity (15). Additionally,
both assay procedures were adapted using BH4 instead of 6methyltetrahydropterin.
(6R,S)-BH4 and 6-methyltetrahydropterin were purchased
from Dr. B. Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland).
CASE REPORTS

Patient 1. M.LJ. is the third child of healthy, unrelated parents
of Yugoslav origin. Family history, pregnancy, and birth (at
term) were uneventful; birth weight was 2930 g; length, 48 cm;
and head circumference, 34 cm. The Apgar scores were 9, 10,
and 10 at 1, 5, and 10 min, respectively. In the postnatal period,
hyperbilirubinemia (306 pmol/L), due to A0 incompatibility,
was noted and treated with phototherapy. Hyperphenylalaninemia was detected by the Guthrie test in the course of the national
screening program. It took 6 wk to get a serum for quantitative
amino acid analysis due to noncompliance of the parents. At the
age of 2 mo, plasma phenylalanine concentration was 284 pmol/
L. Until the age of 2 1 mo, plasma phenylalanine ranged from
73 to 399 pmol/L while the patient was on a free diet. So far,
the child shows a normal psychomotor development on a normal
diet without any phenylalanine restriction and without substitution with BH4 or neurotransmitter precursors, growing along the
25th percentile for all body measurements. At the age of 18 mo
magnetic resonance imaging of CNS revealed no abnormalities.
Patient 2. G.A. is the first child of Turkish parents, who are
first cousins. Family history, pregnancy, and birth (weight, 3200
g; length, 50 cm; head circumference, 34 cm, and Apgar scores,
9, 10, and 10 at 1, 5, and 10 min, respectively) were uneventful.
Hyperphenylalaninemia was detected by the neonatal screening
program. At the age of 2 wk, the plasma phenylalanine concentration was 500 pmol/L. The CSF concentration of the serotonin
metabolite was substantially reduced, and cofactor replacement
therapy was started with 10 mg BHJkg body weight, given in a
single dose. Tetrahydrofolate concentrations in serum measured
a t the age of 1,2,3, and 9 mo were in the normal range (between
10.3 and 22.4 ng/mL). There had been no restriction of phenylalanine in the diet. No abnormalities were found in cranial
magnetic resonance imaging scans performed at the age of 1 and
2 y. Examination of auditory-, visual-, and sensory-evoked potentials performed every 6 mo was always normal. The psychomotor development up to the age of 30 mo was completely
normal, but during the last year a deceleration of the head growth
was observed. At the age of 30 mo, the patient was microcephalic
with a head circumference 0.5 cm below the 3rd percentile. Body
weight was between the 3rd and 10th percentile; length was
between the 10th and 25th percentiles. Because of the reduction
of serotonin biosynthesis in CSF and because of the developing
microcephaly, additional therapy with 5-hydroxytryptophan (2.5
mg/kg body weight/d) and folinic acid (15 mg/d) was started.
RESULTS

BH4 loading test. In patient M.LJ., both oral administration
of BH4 (7.5 mg/kg body weight) as well as combined oral loading
with phenylalanine (100 mg/kg body weight) and, 3 h later, with

BH4 (20 mg/kg body weight) showed a decrease of plasma
phenylalanine after 4 and 8 h (Table 1). The hydroxylation rate
of the administered phenylalanine after loading with BH4, calculated as the amount of phenylalanine converted to tyrosine,
was found to be 43% (4 h) and 87% (8 h). In patient G.A., an
oral loading test with 20 mg BH4/kg body weight showed similar
normalization of plasma phenylalanine.
Pterins in urine and CSF. Urinary total neopterin and total
biopterin were slightly increased in both patients. The pterin
pattern was similar to that found in patients with classic PKU
(Table 2). Percentage of biopterin (of the sum of neopterin and
biopterin) was between 34 and 62% in the urine of patient M.LJ.
and between 3 1 and 82% in the urine of patient G.A. However,
patient G.A. had been on BH4 monotherapy (10 mg/kg body
weightld) since the age of 3 mo. In the second patient, neopterin
excretion decreased with age, whereas biopterin excretion increased. A percentage of biopterin in urine greater than 80 usually
is characteristic of DHPR deficiency. The percentage of BH4 (of
the sum of BH4, dihydrobiopterin, and biopterin) in the urine of
patient M.LJ. was 7%, and in patient G.A., 17%, both markedly
below the normal range of -60%.
In the CSF, total neopterin was normal and total biopterin
increased (Table 2), a pattern typical for DHPR deficiency. High
neopterin in the CSF of patient G.A. at the age of 1 mo was
probably due to a viral infection.
Neurotransmitter metabolites in CSF. The most interesting
finding is that 5HIAA was markedly decreased, whereas HVA
was in the normal range in both patients (Table 2). With increased age, values remained in the same range, and there was
no correlation with either the changes in neopterin and biopterin
content in the CSF or the plasma phenylalanine and tyrosine
concentrations. These findings indicate diminished serotonin
and normal catecholamine biosynthesis in the CNS, an unusual
finding for patients with BH4deficiency. Trial of cofactor replacement therapy (10 mg/kg body weight/d) over 7 d in the patient
G.A. resulted not only in a favorable control of hyperphenylalaninemia, but also in a slightly increased production of serotonin
in the CSF, as was indicated by the CSF levels of 5HIAA (Table
2). Surprisingly, interruption of BH4 treatment for 4 d resulted
in neither a substantial increase of plasma and CSF phenylalanine nor a drop of CSF neurotransmitter metabolites (data not
shown). After 8 wk without any medication, 5HIAA in CSF was
further reduced and HVA lowered to borderline. Despite excellent psychomotor development of the patient, treatment with
BHI was reintroduced at the age of 6 mo, resulting in a good
control of the plasma phenylalanine. HVA completely normalized, whereas 5HIAA remained below the control value.
DHPR activity in erythrocytes and skin fibroblasts. Diagnosis
of DHPR deficiency was confirmed by the measurement of

enzyme activity in the patients' erythrocytes and cultured skin
fibroblasts (Table 3). In the erythrocytes of both patients, no
DHPR activity was detectable if either the synthetic (6-methyltetrahydropterin) or the natural (BH4) cofactor was used in the
assay. Both parents were diagnosed to be heterozygous for DHPR
deficiency, showing a reduced enzyme activity of -50% of controls. In the cultured skin fibroblasts of the patients M.W. and
G.A., a severely reduced DHPR activity of 4 and lo%, respectively, was found.
Screening for nucleotide substitution. cDNA screening of the
patients with DHPR deficiency was performed on PCR products
that encompassed the coding region of the cDNA. In the patient
G.A., a mismatch, reacting with osmium tetroxide at base 659,
corresponded to the conversion of T to G (Fig. I), changing
amino acid no. 2 12, phenylalanine (TTC), to cystine (TGC). In
the patient M.W., a mismatch reacting with hydroxylamine at
base 475, corresponded to the conversion of G to A (Fig. 2),
changing amino acid no. 151, glycine (GGC), to serine (GAC).
Both of the mutations are homozygous.
DISCUSSION

Two patients with DHPR deficiency described here demonstrate that every newborn with even slightly elevated plasma
phenylalanine should be screened for BH4 deficiency. The first
patients with BH4 deficiency were already identified in 1969 (16).
Siblings with mild hyperphenylalaninemia, at that time described
as "a genetic variant of phenylketonuria," were later characterized as DHPR deficient (17). Another child with severe neurologic symptoms, despite treatment with a low-phenylalanine diet,

ATYPICAL (MILD) FORMS OF DHPR DEFICIENCY

was found to have normal phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase but no
DHPR activity in the liver (3). Other patients with DHPR
deficiency have been described later (18-20), and, in one family,
two subjects were found to have no DHPR activity in blood but
were clinically normal (21). Unfortunately, this family refused
further investigations aimed at defining the reason for this finding.
The BH, loading test in patients with DHPR deficiency is not
as effective as in patients with 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase deficiency. Because some of the DHPR-deficient patients
did not respond to the dose of 7.5 mg BHJkg body weight (22),
loading with 20 mg BH4/kg body weight was introduced (23).
However, one patient, described as a nonresponder even to this
high dose of BH4, died despite an early diagnosis and treatment
and may represent a "malignant" form of DHPR deficiency (24).
There is a remote possibility that this patient may have had both
phenylalanine hydroxylase and DHPR deficiency, which could
also explain the lack of a response to the BH4 loading test. The
differences in the response to oral loading with BH4 may be due
to the gene dosage effect or more likely to the heterogeneity of
the molecular defect as demonstrated previously (22, 25). In our
patients, in both loading tests (7.5 mg/kg body weight in patient
M.LJ. and 20 mg/kg body weight in patient G.A.) plasma
phenylalanine normalized 8 h after oral administration. The
combined phenylalanine-BH4 loading test performed in patient
M.W. at initially normal plasma levels showed hydroxylation
rates typical for DHPR deficiency.
Distribution of CSF SHIAA (a metabolite of serotonin) and
HVA (a metabolite of dopamine) in patients with DHPR deficiency is similar to that observed in 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin
synthase deficiency. However, the decrease of 5HIAA seems to
be more dramatic than that of HVA (6). Absence of DHPR
activity in the erythrocytes of our patients confirmed the diagnosis, and we expected to find the abnormal profile of the
neurotransmitter metabolites in the CSF. This expectation was
only partially confirmed by very low levels of SHIAA but normal
HVA in the CSF of both children. Despite a low serotonin
biosynthesis, a favorable clinical course, good psychomotoric
development, and high phenylalanine tolerance were found in
our patients. Furthermore, mild hyperphenylalaninemia and
normal CSF phenylalanine levels (data not shown) in both
patients exclude the competitive inhibition of tryptophan-5hydroxylase by phenylalanine. Because there were no signs of
neurologic abnormalities, both children were kept on a normal
diet. A trial with BH4 (10 mg/kg body weight/d) in patient G.A.
resulted, as expected, in complete normalization of plasma phenylalanine levels. Surprisingly, production of serotonin increased
toward normal, and HVA increased substantially. Because the
penetration of BH4 into the brain is known to be poor, cofactor
replacement therapy in DHPR deficiency is usually inefficient.
Furthermore, in one of our patients reintroduction of BH4 therapy normalized only catecholamine production, whereas serotonin biosynthesis remained low. A partial DHPR deficiency
associated with mental retardation was documented by abnormally low levels of SHIAA in the CSF from patients with
neurologic and mental disorders (7). The residual activity of
DHPR in erythrocytes purified by affinity chromatography was
found in a patient with only mild mental retardation without
neurotransmitter therapy (8), suggesting that in mild forms of
DHPR deficiency neurologic symptoms may occur at a later
stage. Therefore, therapy has been started in one patient and will
be started in the second despite normal development so far.
Recently, patient G.A. showed deceleration of head growth
and, despite the good psychomotoric development and normal
blood folate concentrations, we intend to introduce therapy with
the neurotransmitter precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan and folinic
acid. Folinic acid supplementation was shown to improve neurologic symptoms in some patients with DHPR deficiency (26),
with prevention of intracranial calcification (19, 20,27). Because
there is strong support for the belief that DHPR plays a role in

maintaining tetrahydrofolate levels in the brain (28), folinic acid
was recommended to be a part of the treatment in DHPRdeficient patients.
Clinical and neurochemical evaluation in our patients strongly
supported the hypothesis that such atypical (mild) forms of
DHPR deficiency may be due to the same type of mutation.
While screening the cDNA of the DHPR-deficient patients,
different types of mutations such as neutral mutation (polymorphism) of the leucine codon to another leucine codon and
insertion of an extra codon for threonine were detected (13). In
patient G.A., we found a mutation of a phenylalanine codon
(TTC) to cystine codon (TGC), and in patient M.LJ., a mutation
of a glycine codon (GGC) to serine codon (GAC). These two
mutations occur 61 amino acids apart in a protein region not
responsible for the NADH binding. However, there is no direct
evidence that this may be the BH4 binding domain. Therefore,
it seems dimcult to predict the severity of the disease on the basis
of the type of mutation, at least in patients with DHPR deficiency.
The study of our patients with atypical DHPR deficiency
demonstrates the importance of exact neurochemical evaluation
of all children with BH4 deficiency. This includes the measurement of not only pterins in urine but also neurotransmitter
metabolites in CSF. Furthermore, these patients should be controlled periodically during the first years of life regardless of their
clinical status.
