Summary

We have explored the molecular pathology in 28 individuals homozygous or heterozygous for liver arginase
deficiency (hyperargininemia) by a combination of Southern analysis, western blotting, DNA sequencing,
and PCR. This cohort represents the majority of arginase-deficient individuals worldwide. Only 2 of 15
homozygous patients on whom red blood cells were available had antigenically cross-reacting material as
ascertained by western blot analysis using anti-liver arginase antibody. Southern blots of patient genomic
DNAs, cut with a variety of restriction enzymes and probed with a near-full-length (1,450-bp) human liver
arginase cDNA clone, detected no gross gene deletions. Loss of a TaqI cleavage site was identified in three
individuals: in a homozygous state in a Saudi Arabian patient at one site, at a different site in homozygosity
in a German patient, and in heterozygosity in a patient from Australia. The changes in the latter two were
localized to exon 8, through amplification of this region by PCR and electrophoretic analysis of the amplified
fragment after treatment with TaqI; the precise base changes (Arg291X and Thr29OSer) were confirmed by
sequencing. It it interesting that the latter nucleotide variant (Thr29OSer) was found to lie adjacent to the
TaqI site rather than within it, though whether such a conservative amino acid substitution represents a true
pathologic mutation remains to be determined. We conclude that arginase deficiency, though rare, is a
heterogeneous disorder at the genotypic level, generally encompassing a variety of point mutations rather than
substantial structural gene deletions.

Introduction

Liver arginase (L-arginine ureahydrolase; E.C.3.5.3.1)
is the fifth enzyme of the urea cycle, catalyzing the
hydrolysis of arginine to ornithine and urea. Deficiency of this enzyme, which can be determined by
assaying its activity in either liver or red blood cells,
is characterized clinically by hyperargininemia, progressive mental impairment, growth retardation, spasticity, and periodic episodes of hyperammonemia
(Cederbaum et al. 1979; Bernar et al. 1986; Brusilow
and Horwich 1989). The disorder is considered to be

the rarest of the heritable defects of ureagenesis, with
only about two dozen patients described.
Like the genes for the other urea cycle enzymes, that
for liver arginase has been successfully cloned, by two
groups using independently derived antibodies and
finding the same cDNA sequence (Dizikes et al. 1 986a;
Haraguchi et al. 1987; Takiguchi et al. 1988; D.
Klein, unpublished data). The identity of the clones
was established by the transfer of arginase activity
to Escherichia coli by using the isolated cDNA. The
genomic arginase locus appears to exist as a single
copy without detectable pseudogenes in man (Takiguchi et al. 1988; Grody et al. 1989), Musfascicularis
(Klein et al. 1987), and rat (Dizikes et al. 1986b). This
enzyme is found in the cytosol, primarily in liver, and
is called "Al."
A second form of arginase with similar kinetic properties but little or no nucleotide sequence homology

is found in mitochondria (Herzfeld and Raper 1976;
Dizikes et al. 1986a; Grody et al. 1989). It is designated "All" to distinguish it from Al, the form which
is deficient in hyperargininemic patients.
We have applied a combination of Southern and
western blotting, PCR, and direct genomic sequencing
of PCR-amplified patient DNAs, to attempt to elucidate the molecular pathology in a cohort of 28 homozygous or heterozygous individuals who together represent the majority of known families with arginase
deficiency worldwide. While no gross arginase gene
deletions were detected, a number of restriction-fragment-length changes representing point mutations, including one nonsense mutation, were discovered.
Material and Methods
Clinical Material
Patient blood samples or skin biopsies were obtained from 28 individuals homozygous or heterozygous for liver arginase deficiency. Four were from our
own institution, while the remainder were collected
through the cooperation of primary physicians in
many countries; patients were ascertained in North
America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East and were
from a variety of ethnic groups (table 1). Three patients came to be autopsied during the course of the
present study, allowing for the isolation of DNA from
liver and other tissues as needed; the findings in one
of these cases have been reported elsewhere (Grody et
al. 1989). All studies on human subjects conformed
to the guidelines established by institutional review
boards at the respective institutions.

Purification and Analysis of Liver Arginase
Human liver arginase AI, purified to near homogeneity, was obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation, heat treatment, CM-Sephadex ion-exchange
chromatography, gel-exclusion chromatography, and
DEAE-Sephadex chromatography following EDTA
treatment to dissociate the tetrameric enzyme into
monomeric subunits (Schimke 1964b; Vielle-Breitburd and Orth 1972; Skrzypek-Osiecka et al. 1983).
During the purification procedure, fractions were assayed for arginase activity by using the rapid method
of Ruegg and Russell (1980). Several preparations
showing a strong arginase band on SDS-PAGE with
silver staining were pooled for amino acid analysis and
sequencing. The latter was performed on an ABI 470
sequencer at the UCLA Protein Microsequencing Facility.

Enzyme Assay

Arginase activity was determined using our previously published modification (Spector et al. 1980)
of the urease method of Schimke (1964a), by using
guanidino[14C]arginine (Amersham-Searle, Chicago)
as substrate. The specific enzyme activity is defined in
terms of micromoles of arginine hydrolyzed per milligram of total protein per 30 min. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (1976), with BSA
used as the standard. Coomassie blue reagent was obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Richmond, CA).
Western Analysis

To confirm the presence or absence of cross-reacting
material (CRM) in the individuals from whom blood
samples were available, red blood cell lysates were prepared by first removing hemoglobin with DEAE-Sepharose, according to a method described by Huisman
and Dozy (1965) and then concentrating the eluant by
using a Centricon 10 (Amicon) column, according to
the manufacturer's directions. Samples were normalized to the original hemoglobin content of the lysed
red cells and were electrophoresed in SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were blotted by electrotransfer
onto nitrocellulose filters, were treated with rabbit antiliver arginase antibody (Spector et al. 1980, 1983;
Bernar et al. 1986), and were probed with goat antirabbit immunoglobulin-alkaline phosphatase complex (Bio-Rad) according to published procedures
(Symington et al. 1981). Detection was by a chromogenic reaction, using nitroblue tetrazolium and
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate as substrates.
In our hands this assay exhibits a sensitivity down to
2% (or 0.0625 ng) of normal arginase antigen (R. M.
Kern, unpublished results).
Southern Blot Analysis
Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood
leukocytes or other tissues by published protocols
(Kunkel et al. 1977; Hermann and Frischauf 1987).

Restriction-enzyme digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, capillary blotting onto nylon membranes (Hybond; Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL), and hybridization with a 32P-labeled, 1,450-bp human liver
arginase cDNA probe (Dizikes et al. 1986a) were performed according to methods described elsewhere
(Southern 1975; Gatti et al. 1984).

arginase genes of three patients, this exon was amplified by PCR (Saiki et al. 1988) using synthetic primers
(Research Genetics, Huntsville) complementary to the
3' end of this exon and to the junction region with
intron 7, derived from published sequence data (Haraguchi et al. 1987; Takiguchi et al. 1988). Specifically,
the sequence of the 5' sense primer was 5'-ATTACAATTTGTTGTTGTA-3', which is complementary to
the extreme 3' end of the intron. The sequence of the
3' antisense primer was 5'-CTTGTTATAAAGAGTTTATT-3', which is complementary to the exon 8 3'
region including the polyadenylation signal (nucleotides 1369-1389 of the cDNA). PCR products were
analyzed for the presence of an intact TaqI site by
simple digestion followed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining, as well as by direct
sequencing (Brow 1990).

Results
Western Blot Analysis

Whole blood and/or liver samples were available
from 15 of the homozygous patients. Protein extracts
were electrophoresed in SDS-10% polyacrylamide
gels, were blotted onto nitrocellulose filters, and were
probed sequentially with rabbit anti-human liver arginase antibody and goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulinalkaline phosphatase complex, to detect material that
cross-reacted (i.e., CRM) immunologically. Only 2 of
the 15 showed evidence of CRM by this type of western blot analysis; representative results are shown in
figure 1. Thus, a substantial majority of these patients,
who all have undetectable levels of arginase Al enzymatic activity (at least in their red blood cells), apparently do not have any detectable inactive arginase pro-

and amino acid analysis data obtained on purified human liver arginase. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was identical to the predicted one in 17 of 22
readable amino acids (fig. 2), while the predicted one
coincides with the second most likely amino acid analyzed at an additional three positions (data not
shown). Two amino acids at the N-terminus of the
protein were not distinguishable, but their position
indicates that the terminal methionine alone is cleaved
during the process of arginase maturation. Total
amino acid content of the protein was also consistent
with that predicted from the cDNA sequence (table
2). Taken together, these data are the final confirmation that the cDNA used is indeed that for arginase Al.

cDNA Authentication

Isolation and initial characterization of our nearfull-length human liver arginase cDNA has already
been reported elsewhere (Dizikes et al. 1986a). To
confirm the authenticity of this probe, both DNA sequencing and correlative protein-sequencing were performed. The sequence of the cDNA isolated by us
concurred exactly with that of the arginase cDNA
cloned independently by Haraguchi et al. (1987) (D.
Klein, W. W. Grody, and S. D. Cedarbaum, unpublished observations). Furthermore, the deduced amino
acid sequence correlated with protein-sequencing data

the variety of restriction enzymes used, while a few
demonstrated minor changes with a single enzyme,
compared with control DNA. The most commonly
observed variation was apparent loss of a TaqI recognition site, which was seen in three patients of widely
divergent geographic and ethnic origin (Australian patient T.D., Saudi Arabian patient L.B., and German
patient A. W., two of whom are shown in fig. 3).
TaqI is one of the restriction enzymes most often
associated with RFLPs in humans (Donis-Keller et al.
1986). Therefore, more rigorous investigation must
be used to distinguish between benign TaqI variations
and true pathologic changes. Stripping and reprobing
of the blots with subclones derived from the 5', 3', and
midportions of the arginase cDNA tentatively localized the involved TaqI site to the 3' end of the gene in
two of the patients (data not shown). Examination of
prior sequence data of Takiguchi et al. (19 8 8) revealed
a TaqI site in the middle of exon 8 of the normal
arginase gene. This seemed a likely candidate for the
site of a point mutation in at least two of these patients.
Oligonucleotide primers complementary to the 3' end
of this exon and to the junction region with intron 7
were used to amplify this region (a total span of about
500 bp) by PCR, with DNA from these three patients
and normal controls serving as templates. A portion

this site, while patient L.B.'s DNA cut normally, indicating that his

of the PCR products were treated with TaqI, and the
presence or absence of cleavage was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining
(fig. 4). In contrast to what was observed in controls,
the amplified products of patient A.W.'s DNA failed
to cut with TaqI, confirming homozygous loss of the
exon 8 recognition site by mutation. Patient T.D.
proved to be heterozygous for the mutation (i.e.,
proved to be a compound heterozygote), while amplified DNA from patient L.B. cut normally (published
elsewhere [Klein et al. 1991]). We conclude that L.B.'s
TaqI mutation lies outside exon 8.
More definitive analysis of the nature of the exon 8
mutations in patients T.D. and A.W. was accomplished by direct DNA sequencing of the PCR-amplified exon 8 regions. As shown in the sequencing
ladders of figure 5, patient A.W. demonstrated a homozygous cytosine-to-thymine substitution, and patient
T.D. exhibited a heterozygous cytosine-to-guanine
substitution in an adjacent codon. The translational
effect of these mutations is to alter an arginine codon
to a chain-termination signal at position 291 in A.W.
and to substitute a serine for a threonine at position
290 in T.D. T.D.'s mutation is particularly interesting
in that it lies just outside the tetranucleotide TaqI recognition sequence (TCGA) yet still obliterates cleavage with this enzyme.

of the remaining patients (data not shown) will require
further investigation to distinguish between true pathologic point mutations and benign polymorphisms.
Discussion

Arginase deficiency is the rarest of the inborn errors
of urea-cycle enzymes, and its clinical features are also
markedly different from those of the others, primarily
by virtue of both the typical absence of catastrophic
neonatal hyperammonemia and its compatibility with
a much longer life span (Bernar et al. 1986; Brusilow
and Horwich 1989). This has been attributed to the
persistence of some ureagenesis in these patients,
through the activity (and possibly induction) of an
arginase nonliver isozyme predominantly located in
the kidney (Spector et al. 1983; Carvajal and Cederbaum 1986; Grody et al. 1989). Both the rarity of the
disorder and our contacts and collaborations with the
primary physicians of the majority of the known patients worldwide have made possible an extensive
study of this inborn error of metabolism.
As a first step in our analysis of the fine structure of
the arginase gene and its mutations, we have initiated
an investigation of the nature of the DNA defects in
our cohort of patients with liver arginase deficiency.
We have obtained genomic DNA from almost all of
the known arginase-deficient patients in the world; for
those cases in which the patients themselves cannot be
studied, we have obtained DNA from one or both
obligate heterozygote parents.
Previous work by ourselves and others had established the authenticity of the cloned liver arginase
cDNA, with a high degree of probability (Dizikes et
al. 1986a; Haraguchi et al. 1987; Takiguchi et al.
1988). The data presented here close the circle and
complete the authentication of the arginase clones.
The presence of serine as the N-terminal amino acid
in this long-half-life enzyme (Grody et al. 1987) is in
accord with the hypothesis of Bachmair et al. (1986),
who noted that serine, threonine, and alanine, among
others, were the N-terminal amino acids in long-lived
proteins.
The results presented here, produced when this confirmed cDNA is used as probe, are consistent with
the concept that arginase deficiency, though rare, is a
heterogeneous disorder at the genotypic level, apparently encompassing a variety of exonic point mutations (or, conceivably, regulatory mutations) rather
than substantial structural gene deletions. None of

1287
our patients showed evidence of a gross deletion on
Southern blotting. One patient (A.T. in table 1) has
recently been shown to have two frameshift deletions,
of one and four bases, leading to early termination of
translation, compatible with the CRM negativity in
the red blood cells that we observed (Haraguchi et al.
1990). Yet, despite the absence of any gross deletions
of the arginase gene, polypeptide material cross-reactive with anti-liver arginase antibody was detected in
only two of the other patients. If we put aside the
unlikely possibility of a large number of regulatory
mutations blocking transcription of the arginase gene,
we find that these results may indicate either instability
of mutant arginase proteins containing amino acid
substitutions or, less likely, alteration of the epitopes
recognized by our polyclonal anti-arginase antibody.
A precise nucleotide substitution has been identified
in two of the patients by use of PCR and direct sequencing. These mutations lie within or adjacent to
the TaqI recognition sequence in exon 8 of the arginase
gene. As noted, the mutation in one of these patients
(T.D.) is unusual because it lies outside (just 5' to) the
TaqI site as defined by its four-nucleotide sequence,
TCGA, yet still completely blocks cleavage by the enzyme. In addition to the specific oligonucleotide recognition sequence, tertiary structure of the double helix
is known to be an important component of at least
some restriction-endonuclease cleavage sites (Frederick et al. 1984; Kumar et al. 1985). It is conceivable
that some sort of steric or electrostatic hindrance induced by nucleotides adjacent to the recognition site
could have an impact on the cleavability of the site.
Indeed, chemical modifications of adjacent nucleotides introduced into synthetic sequences containing
restriction-enzyme recognition sites have been found
to reduce the rate of hydrolysis (Vinogradova et al.
1987), and an effect of flanking sequences in abolishing cleavage of a particular PaeR7 site in the adenovirus genome has been reported elsewhere (Gingeras and
Brooks 1983). To our knowledge, however, ours is
the first documented instance of such a phenomenon
occurring naturally in the setting of a human genetic
disorder. While the precise mechanism of the phenomenon has not been characterized, the fact that it is
seen by using PCR-generated fragments as substrates
effectively rules out the possibility that chemical modification (e.g., methylation) of the adjacent nucleotide
is responsible.
In the case of the homozygous Taq-site alteration,
the introduction of a chain-terminating codon identifies the mutation as that responsible for the enzymatic

1288

deficiency. The second change, that of serine for threonine at position 290, cannot be confidently inferred to
be responsible for arginase deficiency, since the two
amino acids are so similar in structure and properties
and are often found as apparently conservative mutations in evolution. Threonine 290 occurs in a run of
16 amino acids identical in the AI isozymes of man
and rat (Haraguchi et al. 1987). In yeast this position is
occupied by serine in a run of amino acids substantially
different from that in mammals. Expression studies of
this mutant in arginase-negative recipient cells and/
or sequence analysis of the remaining exons will be
necessary to determine whether this substitution is
pathological.
Two of the three identified mutations in our patient
population occurred in homozygosity. The German
and Saudi Arabian families are known to be consanguineous. Less likely possibilities include either uniparental disomy (Spence et al. 1988) for chromosome 6,
to which arginase Al has been mapped (Sparkes et al.
1986), or complete deletion of the arginase locus on
the sister chromosome.
The nature and significance of the TaqI mutation in
the Saudi family (L.B.) is unknown, except for the fact
that it does not lie within exon 8. However, no TaqI
sites other than the one in exon 8 have been shown,
either by computer sequence analysis or by restriction-endonuclease analysis of the cDNA or its adjacent
intron-exon junctions. The findings on Southern blot
could represent merely a familial polymorphism, as
the father is heterozygous for this alteration (data not
shown).
Taken together, our data suggest that arginase deficiency, despite its rarity, is genotypically heterogeneous. We have previously uncovered a rather
high-frequency polymorphism for the arginase cDNA
probe, with only a single enzyme, PvuII (Kidd et al.
1986). It is possible that some of the remaining Southern blot variations represent benign RFLPs in populations other than the relatively small western European
one at which we looked. We expect that more definitive amplification and sequencing of other exons will
resolve this issue and enable an inclusive worldwide
survey of this inborn error of metabolism at the molecular level.
