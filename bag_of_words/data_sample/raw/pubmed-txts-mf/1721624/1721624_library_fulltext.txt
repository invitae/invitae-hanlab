Abstract
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common, lethal inherited disorder in the Caucasian population. We have recently reported
two African-American patients with nonsense mutations in
each CF gene and severe pancreatic disease, but mild pulmonary disease. In order to examine the effect of these nonsense
mutations on CF gene expression, bronchial and nasal epithelial cells were obtained from one of these patients (no. 246), a
compound heterozygote for nonsense mutations R553X and
W1316X; a healthy normal individual; a patient (no. 528) homozygous for the common CF mutation (AF508); and a CF
patient (no. 272) who carries the R553X mutation and a missense mutation, S549N. When mRNA from bronchial cells of
the normal individual, the AF508 homozygote, and the S549N/
R553X compound heterozygote was reverse transcribed and
amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers derived
from the CF gene, DNA fragments of the predicted size were
observed. However, patient no. 246 with nonsense mutations in
each CF gene has no detectable cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) messenger RNA, and therefore
should have severely diminished, and possibly absent, CFTIR
protein. Furthermore, < 2% of the C1FTR transcripts in nasal
epithelial cells from patient no. 272 (S549N/R553X) were derived from the gene with the nonsense mutation. We conclude
that severe reduction in CFTR mRNA causes CF, but can have
different consequences in the lung and pancreas. (J. Clin. Invest. 1991. 88:1800-1885.) Key words: allele-specific oligonucleotides * genotype * phenotype * polymerase chain reaction*

brane of epithelial cells, patients with CF accumulate unusually viscous secretions in their lungs and pancreas (1, 2). The
gene responsible for CF, termed the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), has 27 exons encoding a
protein of 1,480 amino acids (3, 4). The putative structure of
CFTR is similar to the multidrug resistance proteins in that it
has two ATP-binding sites each of which follows six transmembrane domains (4, 5). The two halves of CFTR are linked by a
proposed regulatory domain which has multiple potential sites
for phosphorylation by protein kinases and many charged residues. The regulatory domain is of unknown function but is
unique within the ATP-binding transporter superfamily (4, 5).
Transfection of cell lines lacking endogenous chloride secretion with CFTR cDNA produces a novel cAMP-mediated chloride current, suggesting that CFTR itself is a chloride channel

(6, 7).
Over 100 mutations in the gene responsible for CF have
now been identified (CF Genetic Analysis Consortium, unpublished data). There appears to be a correlation between presence of the common mutation, AF508, and presence of pancreatic disease (8), but not for the severity of lung disease.
Three nonsense mutations, G542X, R553X, and W1282X
(9, 10) are currently the second, fourth, and fifth most common
CF mutations with worldwide frequencies of 4.2%, 1.5%, and
1%, respectively (CF Genetic Analysis Consortium, unpublished data). The W1282X mutation, a nonsense mutation in
exon 20, is the most common CF mutation in the Ashkenazi
Jewish population where it is present on 50% of CF alleles
(G. R. Cutting, S. M. Curristin, and D. Abeliovich, unpublished data). These population frequencies indicate that - 1 in
200 CF patients carries a nonsense mutation on each CF allele.
The phenotype of patients bearing these nonsense mutations is largely unknown. We have recently reported two patients with a different nonsense mutation in each CF gene and
severe pancreatic disease but mild pulmonary disease (11).
Two additional CF patients, homozygous for the G542X nonsense mutation in exon 11, have been reported with similar
clinical manifestations (12, 13). Nonsense mutations in several
human disease genes have been shown to cause severe reduction in mRNA levels, leading to absent protein product and
severe clinical disease (14-22). Here we report that a CF patient
with nonsense mutations in each CFTR gene has undetectable
CFTR mRNA in bronchial and nasal epithelial cells associated
with severe pancreatic disease but unexpectedly mild pulmonary disease.

Methods
Patients and controls. Patient no. 246, a 22-yr-old African-American
female with CF, is a compound heterozygote for two nonsense mutations; an arginine to stop at codon 553 (R553X) in exon I 1, and a

tryptophan to stop at codon 1316 (W1316X) in exon 21 ( 11). She has
very mild pulmonary disease for her age and severe pancreatic disease
which have been fully described previously (1 1). Tracheal and bronchial cells were collected by bronchial brushing, and nasal epithelial
cells by nasal brushing.
Patient no. 272 is a 14-yr-old African-American male with CF diagnosed at 3.5 yrs of age. His CF mutations have been previously reported
(9); an R553X mutation on one allele, and a missense mutation on the
other allele, serine to asparagine at codon 549 (S549N) in exon 11. He
has pancreatic disease requiring pancreatic enzyme supplementation,
but has had no other gastrointestinal complications. He has mild to
moderate pulmonary disease characterized by a forced vital capacity
(FVC) of 82% predicted, a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV,) of
75% predicted, and a Brasfield chest x-ray score of 15 (best possible
score 25) (23). His overall Shwachman clinical score is 81 (best possible
= 100) (24), and both his height and weight are just above the 25th
percentile. Nasal epithelial cells were obtained from this patient by
brushing and from a primary epithelial cell culture (LDNP) derived
from an excised nasal polyp.
Patient no. S28, a 25-yr-old Caucasian male with CF, is homozygous for the phenylalanine deletion mutation at codon 508 (AF508).
He has pancreatic disease requiring pancreatic enzyme supplementation, but has had no other gastrointestinal complications. He has moderate to severe pulmonary disease characterized by an FVC of 58%
predicted, and an FEV, of 32% predicted. Brasfield chest x-ray score
and Shwachman clinical score are not available. Height is above the
90th percentile; weight is between the 5th and 10th percentile.
Bronchial and nasal epithelial cells were obtained from a 22-yr-old
healthy Caucasian female, and a 30-yr-old healthy Caucasian female,
respectively. Neither individual is a carrier of the AF508 mutation.
Informed consent was obtained for each procedure performed.
RNA extraction and single-strand cDNA synthesis. Cells from
brushings either were placed directly into 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate buffer, or were transferred to culture medium, pelleted and then
resuspended in guanidinium thiocyanate buffer. Cells from the LDNP
cell culture were washed twice with PBS, then scraped offinto 2 ml of4
M guanidinium thiocyanate buffer. Total RNA was extracted using the
acid-guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (25).
Each set of cDNA synthesis experiments included a control sample
in which all reagents except RNA were present. Approximately 3 Mg of
total RNA suspended in 7 Ml of 10 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1%
Sarcosyl was added to 10 Ml of 50 mM oligo-dT (Primer p[dT] 15,
Boehringer-Mannheim Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) and 52 Ml of
diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water in a 0.5-ml Eppendorf tube. The
mixture was incubated at 65°C for 3 min and then chilled on ice for 2
min. 200 U of RNase inhibitor (Boehringer-Mannheim), 5 Ml of 10
mM (each) dNTP (Pharmacia, Inc., Piscataway, NJ), 20 Ml of SX Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT) buffer, and 2 M1
Moloney murine leukemia virus RT (Bethesda Research Laboratories,
Rockville, MD) were added to the mixture, which was then incubated
for 40 min at 37°C. An additional 2 Ml of Moloney murine leukemia
virus RT was added to the mixture which was then incubated for a
further 40 min. The single-strand cDNA was extracted by the addition
of 100 Ml of a 1:1 phenol/chloroform solution. After gentle mixing, the
layers were separated by centrifugation in a microfuge for 90 s at room
temperature. The aqueous layer was transferred to a new tube to which
20 Ml of 2.5 M sodium acetate and 200 Ml of ice-cold ethanol were
added. The cDNA was precipitated for 2-20 h at -20°C. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C, the cDNA pellet was resuspended in 20 Mil of distilled water.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. PCR amplification
was performed as previously described (26). The sequence and annealing temperatures of all PCR primers used are listed in Table I. Each set
of PCR reactions included a control with water replacing the DNA to
check for contamination of PCR reagents. To confirm that cDNA had
been synthesized, and to check for genomic DNA contamination, an
aliquot of cDNA was amplified using primers derived from the human
D3-actin gene (27). The primers are chosen from exons 3 and 5 ofs-actin

so that amplification of cDNA using these primers produces a 228-bp
fragment, while amplification of genomic DNA yields a 435-bp fragment.
In order to confirm the epithelial cell origin of the mRNA, an aliquot of cDNA was amplified using human cytokeratin 15 (HCK 15)
primers (Table I). HCK 15 is an acidic, type I cytokeratin present in
tracheal and epiglottis epithelium in substantial quantities, but not
found in bladder or intestinal epithelium or in squamous cell- or adenocarcinomas (28-30). Amplified HCK 15 cDNA yields a 588-bp fragment.
CFTR cDNA was amplified in sections due to its length. Exons 1-7,
7-10, 11, 13-18, and 18-24 were amplified (Fig. 1). (The antisense
primer used for the 3'-end of exon 10 [C16D] has been previously
described [4].)
Each reaction mixture contained 50-300 ng of cDNA or 5001,000 ng ofgenomic DNA, 10 M1 of lOX Taq buffer (500 mM KCl; 100
mM Tris, pH 8.3; 25 mM MgC12; 0.1% [wt/vol] gelatin), 2.5 U Taq
polymerase (Cetus Corp., Emeryville, CA), 2 ,d 10 mM (each) dNTP
(Pharmacia, Cetus), 2 ,d of each 10 mM primer, and distilled water to
bring the total volume to 100 Ml. After denaturing at 94°C for 6 min, 30
or 35 cycles were performed of denaturing at 94°C for 45 s, annealing
at the temperature indicated in Table I for 45 s, then extension at 72°C
for 1 min. The last cycle was followed by final extension at 72°C for 10
min. 10 ul of each sample was then electrophoresed through a 1%
agarose, 3% NuSieve (FMC Corp., Rockland, ME) gel, stained with
ethidium bromide, and photographed on an ultraviolet transilluminator (Spectromics Corp., Westbury, NY).
Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. Preparation of dot
blots was performed as previously described (26). Filters were hybridized for 60 min with 5 X 106 cpm/ml of 32P end-labeled oligonucleotides specific for either normal or mutant alleles (Table I) (31). The
blots were washed twice at room temperature for 5 min, followed by a
final wash for 15 min at the temperature indicated in Table I.
The amount of radioactively labeled probe hybridized to each DNA
sample dot blotted onto nitrocellulose was assessed by counting the
emissions from 32p three times for 5 min in a liquid scintillation
counter (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA), and using the
average counts per minute. Background counts, defined as the average
counts per minute of three 5-min counts using a comparable size piece
of the filter to which no DNA had been transferred, were subtracted
from the average counts per minute for each DNA sample dot.

Results
Amplification of cDNA reverse transcribed from total RNA of
bronchial and nasal epithelial cells from the normal individuals, patients nos. 246,272, and S28 using fl-actin and HCK 15
primers produced the correct size DNA fragments (Fig. 2, a
and b, some data not shown). This indicated that cDNA was
synthesized, and was of respiratory epithelial cell origin.
CFTR cDNA from exons 1-7, 13-18, and 18-24 was amplified from bronchial and nasal epithelial cells from the normal individuals, the AF508 homozygote (no. S28), and the
S549N/R553X compound heterozygote (no. 272) (Fig. 2,
some data not shown). CFTR DNA could not be detected at
the level of ethidium bromide staining after amplification of
cDNA from bronchial epithelial cells from the patient (no.
246) with nonsense mutations in each CFTR gene (Fig. 2, a
and c). This demonstrated that both the R553X and WI 316X
mutations are associated with reductions in mRNA levels.
Exons 7-13 could not be reliably amplified as one fragment
from single strand cDNA template despite attempts with three
different antisense primers from the 3'-end of exon 13. Therefore, exons 7- 1 0 was amplified. In the initial experiments, all of
the fragments amplified from CFTR cDNA were > 1 kb. Since
amplification of smaller DNA fragments is more efficient than

amplification of larger fragments (32), we amplified a 100-bp
region from exon 11 in an attempt to detect very low levels of
CFTR transcript. Amplification of these exons from bronchial
cell cDNA of the normal individuals, the AF508 homozygote,
and the S549N/R553X compound heterozygote produced the
correct size fragments. CFTR DNA could not be detected from
amplified bronchial epithelial cDNA of patient no. 246 on
ethidium bromide stained gels. In order to increase the sensitivity of detection and to analyze the relative level of transcripts
containing the S549N and R553X mutations, the DNA amplified from exon 11 was hybridized with allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASO).
As shown in Fig. 3, CFTR exon 11 DNA amplified from

oligonucleotides (Fig. 3, 246 Genomic). However, neither ASO
hybridized to amplified cDNA of patient no. 246, indicating
that CFTR transcripts were undetectable in this patient's bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 3, 246 cDNA).

32P-labeled ASO hybridized to PCR-amplified target DNA.
Each CF allele of patient no. 272 is expected to be amplified
equally from genomic DNA. Therefore, these samples were
used to correct for different hybridization affinities of the
ASOs. After subtracting background radioactivity and correcting for ASO affinity, the DNA hybridized with the R553X
ASO had only 3.5% ofthe radioactive cpm of the DNA hybridized with the 549N ASO. This indicates that mRNA transcripts
from the R553X nonsense mutation account for < 2% of the
expected number of CFTR transcripts.

To analyze the region containing the nonsense mutation in
exon 21 (WI 316X), DNA samples amplified from genomic
DNA and cDNA from patient no. 246, and cDNA from a

Discussion
In this study we demonstrate that a patient with two nonsense
mutations in the CF gene, R553X and W1316X, has severely
diminished CFTR mRNA in respiratory epithelial cells. We
have confirmed that R553X, the fourth most common CF mutation worldwide, is associated with a severe reduction in
CFTR mRNA in a second patient (no. 272), a compound heterozygote for this mutation and the S549N missense mutation.
The observation that nonsense mutations in CFTR result
in undetectable levels of mRNA is not unexpected. A number
of nonsense mutations in other genes, such as the f3-globin
gene, the a,-antitrypsin gene, and the insulin receptor gene,
have been associated with significantly decreased or undetectable mRNA levels in cells that normally express the respective
proteins (I15-17, 19-22). Occasionally, nonsense mutations are
associated with normal mRNA levels but truncated proteins
(14, 18). However, when mRNA is severely decreased or undetectable, the respective protein product is absent. We therefore
expect that patient no. 246 has severely reduced or probably
absent CFTR protein.
The mechanism whereby nonsense mutations yield decreased cytoplasmic mRNA levels is not fully understood. Urlaub and colleagues (33) demonstrated that nonsense mutations occurring prior to the final exon of the dihydrofolate reductase gene, when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells,
result in very low intracytoplasmic levels of dihydrofolate reductase mRNA. Nonsense mutations in the last exon of this
gene result in normal levels of dihydrofolate reductase mRNA.
Nuclear run-on studies and actinomycin-D inhibition of new
RNA synthesis demonstrated that the low mRNA levels were
not the result of decreased transcription or rapid degradation of
mRNA. This suggested that mRNA processing and translocation are coupled, leading to the development of two possible
models. In the "translational translocation" model, intracytoplasmic translation pulls pre-mRNA through the nuclear splicing machinery and across the nuclear envelope. Nonsense mutations occurring in the last two exons are not recognized until
after translocation is nearly complete. In the "nuclear scanning" model, pre-mRNAs are scanned for nonsense mutations
prior to translocation across the nuclear membrane. This process might be linked to exon scanning for splice site determination, as recently suggested (34, 35).
Interestingly, the four patients reported (1 1-13) with nonsense mutations in each CF gene have a similar phenotype:
mild to moderate pulmonary disease associated with severe
pancreatic disease. We have demonstrated that one of these
patients has very reduced and possibly absent respiratory epithelial CFTR mRNA, which should result in similar reductions
in protein levels. Although it has not been demonstrated, we
would predict that CFTR is also severely diminished in pancreatic epithelial cells. This suggests that in this patient, severe
reduction in CFTR levels is less deleterious to her lungs than
her pancreas. If CFTR is a chloride channel, as suggested by
recent expression studies (6, 7), perhaps it is not the only pathway for chloride secretion in respiratory epithelial cells. In the
near-absence of CFTR, epithelial chloride channels encoded
by other genes may be able to compensate sufficiently to minimize pulmonary disease.

Hamosh et al.

The observation of mild to moderate lung disease in the
four reported patients with nonsense mutations on each CF
allele (1 1-13) may merely reflect the very small sample size. As
more such patients are described, it might become apparent
that they manifest the same broad variability in pulmonary
disease as is observed in patients homozygous for the AF508
mutation (8). However, if the phenotype of mild pulmonary
disease in CF patients with nonsense mutations on each allele
holds true, it would suggest that severely reduced levels of
CFTR may be less deleterious to respiratory epithelial cell
function than the exclusive presence of altered CFTR. This
hypothesis is consistent with the findings of Smith and coworkers (36) who demonstrated that overexpression of several
mutant CFTR cDNAs in COS cells resulted in incomplete glycosylation of the protein. These authors propose that abnormal
post-translational modification of mutant CFTR interferes
with its trafficking to the cell membrane leading to an accumulation of mutant protein in the Golgi. More recent observations
in normal and CF airway epithelial cells suggest that mutant
CFTR causes abnormal acidification ofintracellular organelles
affecting post-translational modification and trafficking of
other proteins (37). In either case, severe reduction of CFTR in
respiratory epithelial cells might allow more normal intracellular physiology in some patients.
If the mild pulmonary phenotype seen thus far in CF patients with nonsense mutations on each allele does not hold
true, then the variability may be a product of genetic background. The two patients we have described (1 1) are AfricanAmericans. A recent retrospective cohort analysis comparing
the phenotype of black and white CF patients found that black
patients had fewer hospitalizations for pulmonary exacerbations and better mean forced vital capacity and chest x-ray
scores (38). These findings suggest that African-American CF
patients in general have less severe pulmonary disease than
Caucasian CF patients. Since the study did not control for genotype, the phenotypic differences may reflect differences in the
variety of CF genotypes between the two populations. An alternative explanation is that the genetic background of AfricanAmerican patients better compensates for any CF mutation.
Further studies will be necessary to elucidate the role of genetic
background in modifying CF phenotype.
In conclusion, two nonsense mutations in the CF gene,
R553X and W1316X, both result in undetectable CFTR
mRNA in respiratory epithelial cells. Our patient has mild pulmonary disease and severe pancreatic disease, indicating that
CFTR is not essential for viability and that the mechanism of
chloride secretion and the role of CFTR might differ between
the epithelial cells of the lung and pancreas. Since R553X is the
fourth most common CF mutation worldwide, it may be possible to study homozygotes with this mutation to determine the
range of phenotypes when CFTR is absent.
Note added in proof Since we submitted the manuscript for this
article, we have demonstrated that CFTR protein is undetectable by
Western blot analysis of nasal epithelial cell protein from patient no.
246 who has undetectable mRNA (39).
