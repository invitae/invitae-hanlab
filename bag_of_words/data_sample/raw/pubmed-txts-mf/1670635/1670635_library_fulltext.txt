Abstract
Genetic complementation of fibroblasts from patients with
methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) defines a unique class of allelic mutations arising from mutations at the locus encoding the
methylmalonyl coenzyme A (CoA) mutase apoenzyme. Various
phenotypes of MMA have been delineated including complete
absence of enzyme activity (mut') and abnormal enzyme activity with an elevated K. for adenosylcobalamin (muU-). We describe genetic studies on a cell line (WG1130) from a patient
with muta MMA which exhibited an unusual complementation
phenotype, complementing with three of nine mut' cell lines
and four of five mut- cell lines. This suggests that interallelic
complementation occurs between mutant alleles in WG1 130
and subsets of alleles associated with both mut' and mut- phenotypes. The methylmalonyl CoA mutase cDNA was cloned
from WG1 130 and found to contain
A (Arg&3-- His)
G3m
mutation. Gene transfer of this mutant clone into primary fibroblasts from patients with MMA confirms that this mutation
expresses a mut' phenotype when transferred into a mut' cell
line with low levels of mRNA but can contribute to apoenzyme
function when transferred into mut cell lines which show correction with WG1 130 by somatic cell complementation. These
results point to further heterogeneity within both mut' and
mut- and may enable identification of mutations affecting discrete components of apoenzyme function. (J. Clin. Invest.

Introduction
Methylmalonic aciduria may occur as a result of a block in the

CoA. Such a deficiency arises from either a defect in methylmalonyl CoA mutase (MCM),' the mitochondrial homodiAddress reprint requests to Dr. Rosenblatt, Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, McGill University, 687 Pine Avenue,

meric enzyme that catalyses the reaction, or a defect in the
pathway for the synthesis of 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin
(AdoCbl), the Cbl-derived cofactor required by the MCM
apoenzyme. Genetic complementation analysis of cultured fibroblasts from patients with methylmalonic aciduria without
homocystinuria has defined three complementation classes
that reflect the clinical response to Cbl supplementation: mut,
which has a defective MCM apoenzyme; and cblA and cblB,
which represent defects in the intramitochondrial synthesis of
AdoCbl cofactor.
The mut class is divided into two subclasses: mut- lines
have a MCM enzyme with detectable activity but exhibiting a
greatly reduced affinity for the AdoCbl cofactor; mut0 lines
show no detectable MCM activity even if AdoCbl is provided
in excess. These two subclasses have never been observed to
complement each another, suggesting that the mutations occur
at the MUT locus (1). The recent cloning and sequencing
of human MCM (2, 3) has enabled molecular characterization of mutations at this locus underlying the various phenotypes (4-6).
This investigation involved a primary fibroblast line, designated WG 1130, obtained by skin biopsy from a patient with
neonatal methylmalonic aciduria without homocystinuria
who died at the age of 5 mo. The line exhibited a marked
decrease in propionate (a precursor of methylmalonyl CoA)
incorporation that was unresponsive to Cbl supplementation,
suggesting a mutation in the MCM apoenzyme. Total Cbl distribution was within normal limits, also indicating a defect in
the MCM apoenzyme.
To confirm the diagnosis of WGl 130 as a member of the
mut complementation class, cell-fusion complementation analysis was performed with WG 1 130 against a series of cultured
fibroblast lines representing the cb/A, cblB, and mut complementation classes. As expected, WG 1 130 complemented with
the cblA and cblB cell lines. However, complementation was
also observed with four out of five mut- lines and three out of
nine mut" lines. Such findings strongly suggest the possibility of
interallelic complementation.

Methods
Materials. Cell culture media and fetal calf serum was obtained from
Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, NY; [1-'4C]propionate from New
England Nuclear, Boston, MA; and polyethylene glycol 1000 from the
S. T. Baker Chemical Co., Phillipsburg, NJ.
Cell culture. Skin fibroblasts were obtained from the proband with
informed consent and designated WGl 130. Fibroblasts from patients
with documented muto and mut- mutations were available from the
collections at Yale University, Baylor College of Medicine, and McGill
University. The characteristics of cell lines from Yale University have
been reported (1,7,8): WG 1510 (Yale 418, mut); WG1511 (Yale 589,
mut-); WG1512 (Yale 663, muto); WG1599 (Yale 378, mut-);
WG 1601 (Yale 438, mut); WG 1602 (Yale 505). The characterization

of enzyme, mRNA, and DNA of cells from Baylor College of Medicine have been reported (2, 4): WG 1605 (Edg, mut'); WG1607 (Mas,
muto); WG1608 (Pou, muto); WG1609 (Reg, muto); WG1610 (TS87,
mut-); WGI61 1 (DS79, mut-); WG1612 (GM50, muto); WG1613
(S082, mut).
All strains were determined to be free of mycoplasma contamination. Cultures were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium
with nonessential amino acids supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal
bovine serum. Cbl uptake and distribution and the whole cell incorporation of ['4Cjmethyltetrahydrofolate and ['4C]propionate were determined as previously described (9).
Cell fusion. Equal numbers of cells from two lines were mixed and
plated into tissue culture dishes. 24 h after plating, one half of the
cultures were exposed for 60 s to a 40% solution of polyethylene glycol
1000 in phosphate-buffered saline to induce cell fusion. After an additional 24 h, medium was replaced with Puck's F medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 100 jM [I-'4Cjpropionate (to
give a specific activity of 10 ,Ci/umol) and reincubated for 18 h. At the
end of this period propionate incorporation was calculated as above
(9). To determine whether complementation had occurred the incorporation of propionate from fused and unfused replicates were compared.
Cloning and expression of MCM cDNA. Total RNA was prepared
from confluent fibroblasts and MCM cDNA was generated by primer
extension and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification as described (5, 6). The cDNA was amplified and subcloned into the vector
pGEM7zf(+) (Promega Biotec, Madison, WI). Double-stranded dideoxy sequencing was performed using T7 polymerase (Pharmacia,
Inc., Piscataway, NJ) with T7 (Promega Q501 1), SP6 (Promega
Q512 1), or MCM-specific primers described in (6). The sequence of a
clonal isolate of the MCM cDNA was compared to the sequence from a
pool of 15 independent clones to distinguish authentic heterozygous or
homozygous mutations from artifacts introduced by PCR.
Expression of recombinant MCM. A vector which expresses the
normal consensus human MCM cDNA using the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter in the vector pNAss-CMV (10) has been described (1 1). A clone containing the WG 1130 mutation was constructed by PCR amplification of a region from the mutant cDNA
spanning the MspI site, the mutation site, and the KpnI site, and recombining the MspI/KpnI fragment ofthis material with NotI/MspI, KpnI/
NsiI, and NsiI/SalI fragments in the NotI/SalI-digested vector pNAssCMV by sequential multipart ligations. The reconstitution of ligated
sites was confirmed by restriction mapping and sequences generated by
PCR were confirmed by sequencing. Clones were introduced via electroporation (12) into a muto primary fibroblast cell line GM 1673 (National Institute of General Medical Services Mutant Cell Repository).
Electroporation was performed using a Gene Pulser (BioRad Laboratories, Richmond, CA) after a 5-min preincubation of 0.6 ml of cells at a
density of 3 X 106/ml with 20 Ag of DNA using voltage pulses of 260 V
at a capacitance of 960 ,F. MCM activity was assayed 2 d after electroporation using a modified propionate incorporation assay which uses
[3H]leucine incorporation to normalize for cell number and constitutive protein synthesis (4). Results of this assay are expressed as the
mean nanomoles of propionate per micromoles leucine incorporated
in triplicate samples.

Results

Biochemical analysis of WG1130. Incorporation of ['4C]propionate into acid-precipitable macromolecules by WG 1 130 fibroblasts was decreased and not responsive to OH-Cbl in the
culture medium: 0.57 nmol/mg protein per 18 h without OHCbl in the culture medium and 0.40 nmol/mg protein per 18 h
with OH-Cbl in the culture medium (controls 10.8±3.7 and
10.9±3.5 nmol/mg protein per 18 h without and with OH-Cbl
[n = 12, k±SD]). Such a finding suggested that the defect was
located in the MCM apoenzyme. The total accumulation and

bation in 25 pg/ml for 4 d was within the control range: 6.47
and 5.7 pg per 106 cells with 11.65% AdoCbl (controls:
4.58±2.0 pg per 106 cells with 15.3±4.2% AdoCbl [x±SD, n
= 12]). After incubation in 50 pg/ml [57Co]CN-Cbl for 72 h,
6.8% of label was found bound to the MCM enzyme and 93.2%
of label bound to methionine synthase after polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis as compared to 19.6% and 80.4%, respectively,
in the controls. In vitro MCM activity was 5.3 nmol succinate
formed/mg per h consistent with levels found for other mut cell
lines [controls: 34.9±4.7 nmol/mg per h, g+SD, n = 9] (4).
MCM mRNA levels were ample and of normal size. In experiments performed by Dr. W. A. Fenton, Yale University, pulselabeling with [35S]methionine showed no difference in
WG 1 130 MCM when compared with other mut cell lines. However, Western blot analysis with a MCM-specific antibody
showed only 10% of the band intensity relative to a mut- cell
line (WG 1599).
Cell-fusion complementation of WGJ130. To confirm the
diagnosis of WG 1130 as a mut, cell-fusion complementation
analysis was performed with WG 1 130 against cultured cell
lines representing cblA (WG 1191), cblB (WG 1185), and a mut
line of the muE subclass (WG 1186). Positive complementation was demonstrated in all three cases by a severalfold increase in [14C]propionate incorporation in the mixed and fused
cultures relative to the mixed and unfused cultures. Self-fusion
of WG 1130 fibroblasts showed no stimulation of propionate
uptake.
Further cell-fusion complementation analyses were performed with WG 1130 to assess if complementation with mut
would be consistent. Cell fusions were performed between
WG 1130 and a panel of fourteen different mut cell lines (five
muF lines and nine muto lines) each characterized either with
respect to amount of cross-reacting material (CRM), as determined by radioimmunoassay, and newly synthesized protein
(7, 8); or with respect to levels of hybridizable messenger RNA
(2, 4). The data obtained, shown in Table I, demonstrate that
WG 1 130 does not complement with six of nine muto cell lines
nor with one of five mut- cell lines. As well, with the three muto
lines which complement, the degree of complementation observed varies from a 10-fold increase in propionate uptake,
seen with WG 1609, to an increase of approximately 50% with
WG 1605. The increase with WG 1601 is twofold.
The three mut0 cell lines that had demonstrated complementation with WG 1 130 were fused with each of the five mutlines described above to see if further complementation within
the mut complementation class might be observed. In no case
was any suggestion of complementation noted (Table II).
Cloning and expression ofMCM cDNA from WG1 130. The
MCM cDNA from WG 1130 was sequenced and a single homozygous mutation (G354 -a A; Arg93 -- His) was identified
(Fig. 1 A).
In order to determine whether this sequence change was
responsible for the phenotype of the WG 1130 cells, a MspI/
KpnI fragment containing this mutation was substituted into
the expression vector containing the functional consensus
MCM cDNA (pCMV-hMCM) to create the clone pCMV 1 130
(Fig. I B). The pCMV 1 130 clone was introduced into the mut0
cell line GM 1673 (phenotypically equivalent to WG 1612), the
muto cell line WG 1609, or the muF cell line WG 161 1. Control
experiments were performed with the normal MCM expression vector pCMV-hMCM, a vector containing the human
MCM cDNA in an antisense orientation, or the vector without

Discussion
We have demonstrated an unusual pattern of complementation between a mut' cell line (WG1 130) and a panel of mut cell
lines with various phenotypes of mut MMA. These studies demonstrate that fusion of WGl 130, a muto cell line lacking any
evidence of apoenzyme activity, with several mut- or mut" cell
lines which are similarly deficient in the MCM apoenzyme,
produces hybrids with significant levels of propionate uptake
activity.
Complementation between two mut cell lines has never
previously been described. In fact, the singular nature of the
MUT locus encoding the MCM apoenzyme was demonstrated
by the presence of a discrete mut complementation group. This
inference has been confirmed by molecular genetic studies
which identified a single chromosomal locus (MUT) gene encoding the subunit of the MCM homodimer (13, 14). Since
there is only a single MUT locus, constitution ofMCM activity
in the mut X WG 1130 hybrids can only arise by interallelic
(intragenic) complementation between the mutant allele in
these cell lines.
Studies by Willard and Rosenberg (1) were able to delineate
distinct classes of mutations within the MUT locus based on
the phenotype of propionate incorporation in response to the
addition of OH-Cbl to the culture medium. Cell lines with no

insert (Fig. 2). Transformation of each cell line with the normal
expression vector results in increased propionate incorporation, whereas transformation with the antisense vector or control vector results in no change of propionate incorporation.
Transformation of the mut0 GM 1673 cell line with the
CMV 1 130 vector produced no increase in propionate incorporation. This demonstrates that the mutation accounts for the
mut' phenotype of the WG 1 130 cell line. In contrast, transformation of the muto cell line WG1609 or the mut- cell line
WG1 61 1 with the CMV1 130 vector produced an increase in
propionate incorporation. This is congruent with the complementation observed by cell fusion and demonstrates that the
Arg93 -- His mutation determines the characteristic phenotype
of the WG 1 130 cell line.
The propionate incorporation assay is not a linear measure
of apoenzyme activity. Other studies using MCM gene transfer
indicate that the stimulation of propionate incorporation in the
WG 161 1 and WG 1609 cell lines after transformation with the
CMV 1 130 vector corresponds to the level observed when < 0.5
,eg of the normal MCM expression vector is electroporated into
muto cells (M Wilkemeyer and F. D. Ledley, unpublished
data). Thus the amount of MCM apoenzyme produced by
complementation may be < 5% that in normal fibroblasts.
This is consistent with the fact that we were unable to demonstrate an increase in apoenzyme activity in transformed cells
using a relatively insensitive in vitro assay (data not shown).

Raffet al.

More recent studies have demonstrated that within the mut0
class some cell lines exhibit apparently normal levels of MCM
mRNA and some exhibit specifically decreased levels of MCM
mRNA (4).
The cell lines used in the present study represent a spectrum
of mut phenotypes. Most of the mut- cell lines were found to
complement WG 1130. WG 1599 (Yale 378), the one mur line
that did not complement with WG 1130, has been shown to be
a classic mut- on the basis of propionate uptake responsive to
OH-Cbl, the presence of residual MCM activity with an elevated Km for AdoCbl, and the presence of CRM (1, 7). In
contrast, most muto cell lines did not complement with
WG 1130. Three muto lines were found that did complement
with WG 1130 (Table I). The muto phenotype of these cells was
confirmed by the absence of MCM activity and the absence of
an increase in propionate incorporation in response to the addition of OH-Cbl to the culture medium.
WG 1130 itself can be classified as a muto mutation on the
basis of low MCM apoenzyme activity in cell extracts and low
propionate incorporation in culture which does not respond to
OH-Cbl. Cloning and sequencing of the cDNA from this cell
line revealed a single point mutation which is shown to be
capable of disrupting the activity ofthe recombinant MCM in a
transfer assay which utilizes a mut' cell line with reduced
MCM mRNA and no immunoreactive protein (6, 11). In contrast to the inability of the CMV 1130 expression vector to express MCM activity in the muto cell line GW1673, this vector
was capable of stimulating propionate uptake in the mut- cell
line WG 1611 and the muto cell line WG 1609. These data demonstrate that the Arg93-* His mutation is capable of expressing
the complex phenotype identified the by cell fusion complementation studies described above. This mutation expresses a
mut0 phenotype in the homozygous (or hemizygous) state but
is apparently able to contribute to a functional MCM apoenzyme by interallelic complementation in certain heterozygous
combinations.
It is significant that the ability of cells to complement with
WG 1130 is not predicted by their mut- or mut' phenotype.
The present studies reveal at least three subsets of mut0 alleles.
The first is the Arg93 -* His mutation of the WG 1130 allele.
The second is the allele present in the WG 1609 line which will
complement WG 1130 but not other cell lines. The third includes the majority of alleles which do not complement
WGl 130 and remain classic mut' alleles with no evidence of
enzyme activity such as those in WG 1612 or GM 1673. Similarly, two fundamentally different defects within the mur class
can be distinguished by their ability to complement WG I130.
The observation that most mutE cells will complement
WG 1130 is particularly interesting and suggests a possible
mechanism for this complementation. Since mur cells are presumed to have a fundamental defect in Cbl binding, it may be
presumed that the WG 1130 gene product is capable of providing Cbl binding in a heterodimer. Conversely, the WGl 130
gene product must be defective in other aspects of enzyme
function which are compensated by the mut- gene products.
The specific mechanism of complementation is not addressed
by the present work. Future experiments will require higher
levels of apoenzyme expression for biochemical analysis to address whether this complementation is caused by improved
stability of the hybrid dimer, altered secondary or tertiary

structure ofthe monomeric subunits, complementation of constituent functions required for holoenzyme activity, or a combination of these. It is our expectation that these studies may
provide powerful insights into discrete and complementable
aspects of enzyme structure and activity.
