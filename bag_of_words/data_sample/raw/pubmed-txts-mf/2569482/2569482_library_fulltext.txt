Abstract
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant
disease caused by mutations in the LDL receptor gene, is five
times more frequent in the Afrikaner population of South
Africa than it is in the population of the United States and
Europe. It has been proposed that the high frequency is due to
a founder effect. In this paper, we characterized 24 mutant
LDL receptor alleles from 12 Afrikaner individuals homozygous for FH. We identified two mutations that together
makeup > 95% of the mutant LDL receptor genes represented
in our sample. Both mutations were basepair substitutions that
result in single-amino acid changes. Each mutation can be detected readily with the polymerase chain reaction and restriction analysis. The finding of two common LDL receptor mutations in the Afrikaner FH homozygotes predicts that these
mutations will predominate in the Afrikaner population and
that the high frequency of FH is due to a founder effect. The
increased incidence of ischemic heart disease in the Afrikaner
population may in part be due to the high frequency of these
two mutations in the LDL receptor gene.

Introduction
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)' is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the gene coding for the
LDL receptor (1). The LDL receptor is a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates the transport of LDL into cells and is
pivotal in cholesterol homeostasis (2). Individuals who are heterozygous for a mutation in the LDL receptor gene have an
elevated plasma LDL and an increased risk for the development of atherosclerosis. FH homozygotes have mutations in
both their LDL receptor genes that can be either identical (true

homozygotes) or different (compound heterozygotes). These
individuals have dramatically elevated plasma LDL levels and
develop ischemic heart disease in childhood (1). After the LDL
receptor gene was cloned (3), numerous mutant alleles from
FH homozygotes were characterized at the molecular level. A
vast array of mutations, including insertions, deletions, nonsense, and missense mutations have been described (4) and
rarely has the same mutation been found in two unrelated
individuals. The diversity of mutations responsible for FH has
complicated the development of molecular assays to detect
mutations at this locus for the purpose of prenatal diagnosis.
Despite the general diversity of mutations, in three populations specific mutant alleles have been shown to be common.
A nonsense mutation in the LDL receptor gene has been
found exclusively in FH homozygotes of Christian Lebanese
descent (5). In a survey of French Canadian FH heterozygotes
from the Montreal region, 60% were shown to have the same
large deletion in the 5' region of their LDL receptor gene (6).
Finally, a deletion in the 3' end of the LDL receptor gene is
common in the Finnish population (7). The distinguishing
features of these three populations are that they all originate
from a small number of founders and have remained genetically isolated. The frequencies of FH in these populations are
strikingly higher than in the general world population, where
the frequency is 0.2% (1).
Another population with a high frequency of FH is the
Afrikaner of South Africa, where the frequency of FH has been
estimated to be about five times that of other populations
(8-10). The Afrikaners are descended from a small number of
original settlers whose offspring remained genetically isolated
while undergoing a rapid numerical expansion (1 1-13). Biosynthetic studies of the LDL receptor protein in cultured fibroblasts derived from skin biopsies of Afrikaner FH homozygotes have demonstrated at least two different mutant alleles
(14, 15). The normal LDL receptor protein is composed of 839
amino acids. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), N-linked and
nascent 0-linked sugar chains are added to the amino acid
backbone to produce a precursor protein with an apparent
molecular weight of 120,000. Within 30 min, the precursor
is transported from the ER to the Golgi complex and the apparent molecular weight increases by 40,000 due to maturation of the sugar moieties (2). One of the Afrikaner mutations
results in the production of a normal-sized LDL receptor precursor whose processing to the mature 160-kD form is retarded. The LDL receptor protein that reaches the cell surface
is defective in LDL binding. The other mutant allele also produces an LDL receptor precursor which is processed slightly
more slowly than usual to its mature form and is then rapidly
degraded(14, 15).
In this study, we used 10 restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) associated with the LDL receptor gene to
-

construct LDL receptor haplotypes (16) and estimate the number of different mutant LDL receptor alleles represented in 12
unrelated Afrikaner FH homozygotes. We found two common
haplotypes that were each in linkage disequilibrium with a
different mutation in the LDL receptor gene.

Methods
Materials. Restriction enzymes used for analysis of RFLPs and for
detection of mutations on amplified DNA were purchased from New
England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN).
Thermus acquaticus DNA polymerase was obtained from PerkinElmer Cetus (Norwalk, CT). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a
DNA synthesizer and genomic DNA was extracted by nucleic acid
extractor (models 380A and 340A, respectively; Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). Genomic DNA was amplified using the DNA thermal cycler from Perkin-Elmer Cetus (Norwalk, CT). [y-32P]ATP used
for end-labeling oligonucleotides was purchased from ICN Radiochemicals (Irvine, CA). [135S]Methionine and [a-32P]CTP were both
obtained from New England Nuclear (Boston, MA). IgG-C7 and
IgG-200 1, mouse MAbs to the human LDL receptor and an irrelevant
antibody, respectively, were prepared as previously described ( 17).
Haplotype analysis. Genomic DNA was isolated from cultured
fibroblasts or blood leukocytes of 12 unrelated FH homozygotes residing in the vicinity of Johannesburg, South Africa. 8 gg of genomic
DNA were digested independently with a fivefold excess of 10 different
restriction enzymes previously demonstrated to reveal RFLPs, and
analyzed by Southern blotting with the appropriate probes as described
elsewhere ( 16).
DNA sequencing of mutant alleles. 1 gg of genomic DNA was
subjected to gene amplification using the polymerase chain reaction
according to Saiki et al. (18) with the following modifications: (a) the
DNA was annealed to the primers and extended for 6 min at 68°C; (b)
the denaturation was performed for 1 min at 95°C; and (c) 35 amplification cycles were performed. Each exon was individually amplified in
a 50-ul volume using 50 pmol of two oligonucleotides homologous to
the intron sequences flanking the exon. One oligonucleotide was end
labeled (19) (specific activity = 3,000 Ci/mmol) and one was unlabeled. After amplification, the entire DNA sample was size-fractionated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in buffer A (50 mM Tris-borate, 90
mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA at pH 8.3) at 200 V and 50 mA. The
band corresponding to the amplified exon sequences was excised from
the gel, crushed and soaked overnight in I ml of buffer (0.5 M ammonium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, and 1 mM EDTA), purified,
and subjected to DNA sequence analysis using the technique of
Maxam and Gilbert (20).
Detection of mutant alleles by restriction analysis. Genomic DNA
sequences flanking and including each mutation were selectively amplified using one labeled and one unlabeled oligonucleotide. An aliquot of the amplified product (20-50 ng) was purified and subjected to
restriction enzyme analysis. The DNA was digested twice with a restriction endonuclease that was expected to detect the mutant allele,
electrophoresed on a nondenaturing 6% polyacylamide gel in buffer
A, and subjected to autoradiography on Kodak XAR-5 film for 1 h
at 24°C.
Mutagenesis and transfection ofmammalian cells. DNA fragments
from the expression plasmid pLDLR4 were subcloned into the bacteriophage M 13, and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed as previously described (21). The relevant mutation was confirmed by sequencing and a fragment containing the mutation was
subcloned into pLDLR-2, a plasmid containing a cDNA encoding the
human LDL receptor under the control of the Simian Virus (SV)-40
early promoter (21). The two plasmids, pI01 and p724, encode an
LDL receptor protein identical to the normal protein except for amino
acid substitutions at position 206 (aspartate to glutamate) and 408
(valine to methionine), respectively. The constructs

pl0l and p724

were characterized by DNA sequencing before transfecting into
ldlA-7 cells, a mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line that
does not have a functional LDL receptor (21, 22). Stable cell lines were

selected by indirect immunofluorescence with the antireceptor MAb
IgG-C7 (21). The cell lines transfected with p1O1 and p724 were designated TR- 1 163 and TR- 1 178, respectively. TR-7 15 cells, a stable line
of ldlA-7 cells that was transfected with pLDLR-2, have been previously described (21).
LDL receptor assays. Transfected cells were set up for experiments
on day 0 according to a standard protocol as previously described (21).
Experiments were performed on day 4. The cells were radiolabeled
with [35S]methionine for 1 h and subjected to immunoprecipitation
with IgG-C7 after various chase periods, as previously described (23).
SDS-PAGE of 35S-labeled cell extracts was performed and the apparent
molecular masses were calculated by reference to the migration of the
following marker proteins: myosin (200 kD), 13-galactosidase (1 16 kD),
phosphorylase b (97 kD), BSA (68 kD), and ovalbumin (43 kD). Proteins were visualized by fluorography using Kodak XAR-5 film and
intensifying screens (Lightning Plus; DuPont Co., Wilmington, DE)
for the time periods indicated in the figure legends at -70°C.

Results
We used 10 different RFLPs (16) to determine the haplotype
of each LDL receptor allele in 12 unrelated Afrikaner FH
homozygotes. A majority of the patients were homozygous at
each restriction site and thus were homozygous for the same
LDL receptor haplotype (Table I). Four of the FH homozygotes (FH-2a, FH-5a, FH-6a, and FH- 11 a) were heterozygous
at more than one restriction site and in these individuals the
first degree relatives were analyzed to determine the haplotypes. Only three different RFLP haplotypes were found and
each has been previously observed (16). LDL receptor haplotype 3 was the most common haplotype and composed 66.6%
of alleles. Haplotype 15 was the next most frequent and made
up 29.2% of the mutant LDL receptor alleles analyzed. Together, haplotypes 3 and 15 composed 95.8% of the 24 mutant
LDL receptor alleles sampled. Only a single mutant gene was
found to have an LDL receptor haplotype other than 3 or 15
(FH-2a).
The high frequency of two LDL receptor haplotypes in the
Afrikaner homozygotes suggested that each of the two common haplotypes might be associated with a different mutation.
Therefore, an individual homozygous for haplotype 3 (FH- la)
and an individual homozygous for haplotype 15 (FH-3a) were
selected for further analysis. Genomic DNA from each of these
two patients was subjected to gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction using pairs of oligonucleotides homologous
to intron sequences flanking each exon of the LDL receptor
gene. In each amplification reaction one end-labeled and one
unlabeled oligonucleotide were used. The amplification products were size-fractionated on a polyacrylamide gel and the
amplified DNA fragments were excised and purified. Each
DNA fragment, containing a single exon, was subjected to
sequence analysis using the Maxam and Gilbert technique
(20). Both strands of exons 1-17 as well as the coding region of
exon 18 of the LDL receptor gene were sequenced. The sequence of each LDL receptor gene was compared with the
normal sequence (24) and only one basepair difference was
found in each FH homozygote (Fig. 1).
Fig. 1 A shows the sequence ofthe noncoding strand of the
3' end of exon 4 of the LDL receptor gene from a normal
individual and from FH-la. A single basepair substitution of a
cytosine for a guanine in the codon for amino acid 206 was

found and the resultant amino acid change is an aspartic to a
glutamic acid. Fig. 1 B shows the sequence of the noncoding
strand of exon 9 from a normal individual and FH-3a. The
sequences are identical, excluding the codon for amino acid
408. In the third position of this codon there has been a cytosine-to-thymine transition which changes the corresponding
amino acid from a valine to a methionine.
To prove that these two basepair substitutions were mutations and not polymorphisms, each mutation was reproduced
in vitro and expression plasmids encoding the mutant receptor
were transfected into CHO cells lacking a functional LDL receptor. Two permanent cell lines were established: TR-1 163,
containing a plasmid coding for an LDL receptor protein with
the same mutation as FH-la, and TR-1 178, expressing a plasmid encoding an LDL receptor protein identical to FH-3a.
These two cell lines were compared with TR-7 15 cells, a previously described CHO cell line expressing the normal LDL
receptor cDNA (21). The cells were pulse labeled with [35S]956

methionine for 1 h before the addition of unlabeled methionine. Cells were collected after varying periods of chase, solubilized, and subjected to immunoprecipitation using IgG-C7, an
MAb directed against the first cysteine-rich binding repeat of
the LDL receptor gene (25). The immunoprecipitated proteins
were fractionated on a gel and the gel was subjected to fluorography (Fig. 2). The fluorograms were analyzed by densitometry to assay the relative amounts of LDL receptor protein in
the precursor (120 kD) and mature (160 kD) forms.
Fig. 2 A shows the analysis of cells transfected with a normal LDL receptor cDNA. After a 30-min chase, > 50% of the
LDL receptor protein had matured from the 120-kD precursor
to the 160-kD mature form. Fig. 2 B shows the results of a
similar analysis of the FH-I-la cells. This cell line made a normally sized 120-kD LDL receptor precursor that was processed to the mature 160-kD form at a much slower rate than
seen in the cells transfected with the normal LDL receptor
cDNA. It required 2-4 h for 50% of the receptor to reach the

form. C shows the results of a pulse-chase

analysis of the FH-3a cells. These cells also processed the LDL
receptor protein slower than the normal cells but more rapidly
than the FH-la cells.
It was also noted that the LDL receptor protein synthesized
in the FH-3a cells was degraded more rapidly than in the
normal or FH- la cells (Fig. 3). In two separate experiments,
the amount of LDL receptor (I120 plus 160 kD) was estimated
by densitometric analysis of the fluorograms at the various
time points of the pulse-chase experiment. The amount of
receptor protein remaining after each chase interval was averaged and graphed for each cell line. In both normal and FH-la
cells there was no significant loss of LDL receptor protein after
6 h. This is in contrast to FH-3a cells where the receptor was
degraded more rapidly. After 6 h, only 13% of the LDL
-

receptor protein remained.
Each basepair substitution resulted in the creation of a new
restriction site. The guanine to cytosine substitution found in
FH- 1 a created a new Dde I site (consensus sequence: CTNAG)
and the cytosine to thymine change identified in FH-3a
formed a new N1a III restriction site (consensus sequence:
CATG). Therefore, it would be predicted that the mutations
could be assayed by restriction analysis using these two restriction enzymes. FH- 1 a, FH-3a, and FH-6a were analyzed separately for the presence or absence of these two restriction sites

(Fig. 4).

-

Fig. 4 A shows the results of restriction analysis of amplified DNA from subjects FH-6a, FH- la, FH-3a, and the parents of FH-6a. PCR-Dl and end-labeled PCR-D2, 25-base
oligonucleotides homologous to sequences flanking the mutation, were used to selectively amplify the 3' region of exon 4 of
the LDL receptor gene. The purified 220 bp DNA fragment
was subjected to restriction analysis with Dde I and the products were size fractionated on a polyacrylamide gel. In the
normal LDL receptor gene, an 87-bp band would be expected
due to the presence of an invariant Dde I site in exon 4. In
FH-la, a 23-bp band would be expected since a new Dde I site
(labeled Dde I-M) is formed. As expected, FHI la (lane 5) is
homozygous for the 23-bp band and FH-3a (lane 6) is homozygous for the 87-bp band. FH-6a (lane 4) has both the 87- and
23-bp bands and he shares the abnormal band with his mother
(lane 3).
Genomic DNA from these same individuals was subjected
to polymerase chain reaction using end-labeled PCR-Nl and
PCR-N2, two 25-base oligonucleotides homologous to the intron sequences flanking exon 9, and the resultant 222 bp fragment was subjected to Nla III restriction analysis (Fig. 4 B).
Exon 9 of the normal LDL receptor gene does not contain an
Nla III site so a 222-bp fragment is expected if there is no
mutation. In the presence of the point mutation found in
FH-3a, an Ma III site is created and a 126 bp fragment is
expected. As expected, restriction analysis of amplified DNA

were analyzed in a similar fashion and all the alleles with an
LDL receptor haplotype 3 and 15 have the same restriction
pattern as FH-la and FH-3a, respectively (data not shown).

Plasmids encoding the normal LDL receptor protein (pLDLR4), and
the mutant LDL receptor proteins from FH-la and FH-3a were
transfected into LDL-A7 cells, a CHO cell line that makes no LDL
receptors. Permanent cell lines were established and grown as described. The cells were pulse-labeled with 200 MCi/ml of ["5S]methionine for 1 h before incubation in medium supplemented with
0.2 mM cold methionine for indicated time periods. The cells were
then solubilized and the LDL receptor protein was immunoprecipitated using IgG-C7, an MAb to the LDL receptor, and then fractionated on a 7% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS, as described (21).
The gels were dried, enhanced, and then subjected to fluorography
using Kodak XAR-5 film and intensifying screens at -70°C for the
following time intervals: 20 h for the TR-7 15 cells and 6 d for the
TR-1 163 and TR-1 187 cells. The fluorograms were subjected to densitometry and the percentage of immunoprecipitated LDL receptor
in the precursor (120 kD) or mature (160 kD) form was determined
for each cell line at each time point of the chase. A shows the results

(lane 2). Therefore, FH-6a is a compound heterozygote; he
inherited an LDL receptor allele with the same mutation as
FH-la from his mother and an LDL receptor allele like FH-3a

In this study we have characterized two common mutations at
the LDL receptor locus that make up > 95% of the mutant
alleles responsible for FH in a cohort of Afrikaner FH homozygotes living in the Transvaal Province of South Africa. FH
has been estimated to have a frequency of at least 1 in 100 in
the Afrikaner population, which is five times greater than in
the European and North American populations (9, 10). If this
high frequency is due to a founder effect, it would be expected
that one or two LDL receptor mutations would predominate
in the present population of FH Afrikaners. To estimate the
number of different LDL receptor mutations represented in
the 12 FH Afrikaner homozygotes available for analysis, we
determined their LDL receptor gene haplotypes using 10
RFLPs. At the ,B-globin and phenylalanine hydroxylase loci
particular mutations are often in linkage disequilibrium with
particular haplotypes (26-28). Therefore, we took two subjects
homozygous for the two commonly observed haplotypes and
sequenced the coding region of their LDL receptor genes and
identified two different mutations. Fortuitously, each mutation created a new restriction site enabling indirect detection of
the mutation in the remaining FH homozygotes. All the individuals sharing the same haplotypes as FH- la and FH-3a also
had the same corresponding mutation, as reflected by restriction enzyme analysis of selectively amplified DNA segments
(data not shown). Therefore, each LDL receptor mutation was
in linkage disequilibrium with a different RFLP haplotype.
Both mutations resulted in a change in a single amino acid.
To exclude the possibility that the amino acid change was an
innocent polymorphism, we reproduced and analyzed each
mutation in vitro. A permanent cell line expressing the same
mutant LDL receptor protein as FH-la showed an identical
phenotype to that previously observed in fibroblasts cultured

from a skin biopsy of FH-la (15). Biosynthetic studies demonstrated the production of an apparently norm ial 120-kD precursor LDL receptor protein that was not p rocessed to the
160-kD mature form as rapidly as is that of th4e normal receptor protein. Five other mutations at the LDL receptor locus
have been characterized which also result in a similar slow
processing phenotype (5, 23, 29, 30). Three of these mutations
are small in-frame deletions located in the ligaLnd binding domain of the LDL receptor gene, a region ofth ie protein composed of seven cysteine-rich repeats (23, 29, 301). Each of these
mutations results in a deletion of one to foiur amino acids
between cysteine residues whose spacing is hiighly conserved
within each repeat. The deletions may inte arfere with the
proper folding of the LDL receptor protein Nwithin this cysteine-rich region (30). Numerous studies hav( demonstrated
that the transport of newly synthesized proteii ns from the ER
to the Golgi apparatus is highly regulated an d that proteins
that are malformed are not transported normally to the Golgi
complex (for review, see references 31 and 32)1. The mutation
in FH-la is also located in one of the cyste ine-rich ligand
1

region of each

of the seven

repeats there

is

a

triad of conserved

amino acids: serine-aspartic acid-glutamic acid (3) and in
FH- la the aspartic acid is changed to a glutamic acid in the
fifth repeat. The amino acid substitution does not alter the
charge of the residue at this conserved position, but the extra
carbon atom in the glutamic acid must somehow interfere with
the proper folding of the protein.
In FH-3a, a single basepair substitution in exon 9 of the
LDL receptor gene causes an amino acid substitution of methionine for valine. This substitution yields a LDL receptor
protein that is processed more slowly than normal (though not
as slowly as FH- la) and the mature 1 60-kD receptor is then
rapidly degraded. Biosynthetic studies of the LDL
cultured fibroblasts from FH-3a demonstrated

identical

phenotype. The mutation is located in a region on the LDL
receptor that shares 40% homology with part of the epidermal
growth factor precursor gene (33). Prior studies have demon-

strated that this domain is required for the acid-dependent
ligand dissociation and for receptor recycling (34). A single

conservative amino acid change within this region results in a
dramatic increase in the rate of protein degradation, probably
because it interferes with normal recycling.
Based on the analysis of these 12 FH homozygotes,
may predict that two mutations compose the majority of
tant LDL receptor alleles in the Afrikaner
population.

Why do

two mutations occur at such high frequency in this particular
population? The Afrikaners, now numbering 3 million, are
-

descendents of fewer than 2,000 original settlers predominantly from Germany, Holland, and France who emigrated to
South Africa in the 17th and 18th centuries (1 1, 13, 35). Originally they settled in the Cape province, but in the 19th century
many migrated into the Transvaal region. The Afrikaners have
remained largely genetically isolated due to their different language, culture, and religion. They had large families and were
highly dispersed so that consanguinity was common in the
early
generations. The population expanded dramatically in
size over a relatively short period of time (35).
Prior genealogical studies of 29 Afrikaner FH homozygotes
from the Transvaal region showed that many of the families
had ancestors who were members of a particular church, the
Gereformeerde Kerk (GK) (36). This church has the smallest
membership of the three main Afrikaner church denominations. Two surnames were found to be common in the Afrikaner FH pedigrees and these names could be traced back to
original church founders. Of the index families (i.e., the families of the parents of the FH homozygotes), 58% had an affiliation with the GK and numerous consanguineous marriages
were noted in the early generations of the pedigrees of these 29
Afrikaner FH homozygotes. It would now be of interest to
identify which of the two mutations we have identified is
found in the descendents of this particular religious group.
Numerous rare genetic disorders have been found to have a
high frequency in the Afrikaner population including
Gaucher's disease, cystic fibrosis, sclerosteosis, variegate porphyria, lipoid proteinosis, Huntington's chorea, progressive familial heart block, and familial colonic polyposis (1 1, 12). Presumably, the small founder population represented only a
small sampling of the European genetic pool and was enriched

for particular mutant genes. Most likely, among the original
settlers there were one or more individuals (or families) with
either one of the two common LDL receptor mutations identified in this study. One may expect that the Afrikaner population will also contain cases of FH caused by mutations at the
"background" frequency of 1 in 500; the allele present in
FH-2a is presumably one of these.
White South Africans have a higher mortality rate from
coronary heart disease than any other male population between 25 and 34 y of age (37) and the high frequency of FH in
the Afrikaner population may be an important contributing
factor. To determine the exact frequency of each mutation in
the present Afrikaner population, it would be necessary to
screen a large number of FH heterozygotes and homozygotes
for the presence of either of the two mutations we identified.
This can be easily done using the polymerase chain reaction
technique in conjunction with restriction analysis, as we have
demonstrated in this paper. If the frequency of these two mutations is high, as we expect, the appropriate molecular assay
can be applied to the detection of heterozygotes and the prenatal diagnosis of homozygous FH in the Afrikaner community.
