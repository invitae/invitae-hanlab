Summary. RFLPs of 36 normal and 41 mutant alleles at
the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus were determined in
31 Portuguese kindreds. A total of 14 haplotypes including 10 normal and 7 mutant alleles were observed. Almost 75% of all mutant alleles were confined within only
two haplotypes, namely haplotype 9 (17.1%) and haplotype 1 (56.1%). This frequency of mutant haplotype 1
in Portugal is, to our knowledge, the highest for this mutant haplotype in all studies reported to date. Other mutant haplotypes were either rare (haplotype 2, 9.7%) or
totally absent (haplotype 3, 0%). Only 24.5% of all mutant alleles were found to consistently carry identified
mutations, particularly R261Q (9.8%), R252W (3.3%),
R408W (1.6%) and AI94 (3.3%). A new mutation, L249F,
located in the seventh exon of the gene, accounted for
6.5% of all mutant alleles in our series. Interestingly,
this mutant genotype was consistently associated with
mutant haplotype 1 ( P < 0 . 0 1 ) , as also observed for the
R261Q mutation. It appears, therefore, that mutant haplotype 1 is genotypically heterogeneous in Portugal and
that more than two mutations account for its prevalence
in this country.

Introduction
Classic phenylketonuria (PKU) and variant forms of hyperphenylalaninemias are caused by a deficiency of the
liver-specific enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH;
E.C.1.14.16.1). The isolation of the gene and the production of a full-length c D N A for P A H (Kwok et al.
1985) has facilitated the description of a number of different mutations and the characterization of many restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotypes at the P A H locus (Chakraborty et al. 1987). Initial
data showed that specific mutant genotypes are strongly
linked to particular R F L P haplotypes (DiLella et al.
1986; 1987). However, when more PAH-deficient alleles
were studied, it became increasingly apparent that a parOffprint requests to: C. Caillaud

ticular R F L P haplotype may carry different mutations
and, conversely, that a given mutation may be associated
with different haplotypes at the P A H locus (Berthelon et
al. 1991) in Mediterranean countries.
In order to further investigate the genetic heterogeneity of P A H deficiencies in southwestern Europe, a
group of 31 PKU children from Portugal was screened
for eight different mutations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of their genomic D N A and hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides. Moreover, in order to study the genotype-haplotype associations, RFLP haplotypes at the P A H locus were determined for 41 PKU chromosomes.
Surprisingly, one mutant haplotype, haplotype 1, was
prevalent, but genotypically heterogeneous, in Portugal.

Materials and methods
Patients

A series of 31 unrelated families, each with at least one child affected with permanent hyperphenylalaninemia, was investigated
(plasma phenylalanine levels over 15mg/100ml on neonatal
screening, dietary phenylalanine tolerance below 450 mg/day). Patients were evaluated either in the Instituto de Genetica Medica,
Porto, Portugal or in the Department of Pediatrics, H6pital des
Enfants-Malades, Paris, France. The gene pool studied comprised
61 mutant alleles. Of all mutant genes, 59 originated in northern
Portugal (Porto area) and 2 in the Lisbon area. Two families were
of mixed French-Portuguese ancestry and two families were consanguineous.

Methods
For RFLP analysis, genomic DNA isolated from blood leukocytes
was digested using seven restriction enzymes (PvuII, BglII, XmnI,
MspI, HindIII, EcoRV and EcoRI+BamHI) and analysed by
Southern blotting. The full-length PAH cDNA was used as a
probe for hybridization (Kwok et al. 1985) and complete RFLP
haplotypes were established for each family member and classified
(Woo 1988). Unambiguous determination of haplotypes was possible in 21 of 31 families for a total of 77 chromosomes (36 normal
alleles and 41 mutant alleles). Comparison of RFLP and haplotype

the chi-square test with Yate's correction when necessary.
For allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) screening of muta~
tion-containing regions, amplification primers, ASO probes and
experimental procedures were as previously described, namely:
(1) IVS-12 (DiLella et al. 1986), (2) AI94 (Caillaud et al. 1991),
(3) R261Q (Abadie et al. 1989), (4) R252W (Abadie et al. 1989),
(5) E280K (Lyonnet et al. 1989). Screening for the L311P mutation was performed by Southern blotting via detection of the specific MspI pattern (Lichter-Konecki 1988a).
For characterization of the L249F mutation, amplified exon 7
was cloned in phage M13 mpl8 and sequenced by the dideoxy
chain-termination method. Subsequent screening for this mutation
was performed using the following ASO probes: normal probe, 5'
GCTGGCCTGCTTTCCTCTC 3'; mutant probe, 5' G A G A G G A A A A C A G G C C A G C 3'. Temperatures for hybridization and
washing were 58~ and 64~ respectively.

In order to study the segregation of the L249F mutation in affected families, the amplified exon 7 was hybridized with either a normal or a mutant ASO probe.
Figure 1B shows that the proband (II2) was homozygous
for the mutant genotype while her affected mother (I2),
her affected brother ( I l l ) , and her healthy father (I1),
were all heterozygous for the L249F mutation.
Four mutant haplotype 1 alleles were associated with
the R261Q mutation first described by Abadie et al.
(1989), but this genotype was also associated with mutant haplotype 2 in our series.
Discussion

Using a full-length human P A H c D N A sequence as a
probe, extensive RFLPs have been identified at the human P A H locus and over 50 R F L P haplotypes have been
catalogued (Woo et al. 1983; Woo 1988). Interestingly,
most P K U alleles are associated with only four haplotypes in Caucasians, namely haplotypes 1-4 (Chakraborty et al. 1987). Haplotype 1 is prevalent among mutant, as well as normal, alleles throughout Europe but

the frequency of the mutant haplotype 1 is very different
in various European regions. Hitherto, the frequency of
mutant haplotype 1 ranged from a low of 0-10% in eastern Europe to a high of 50% in Switzerland (Table 3)
Here, we report a frequency of 56% for mutant haplotype 1 in Portugal. This is, to our knowledge, the highest
frequency for mutant haplotype 1 in all studies reported
to date (Table 3). The prevalence of this mutant haplotype in Portugal approached the record figures for mutant haplotype 2 in eastern Europe (54% and 70% for
Hungary and Czechoslovakia, respectively, Daiger et al.
1989).
Since several PKU mutations have been described
on the background of mutant haplotype 1 genes, we
first screened mutant haplotype 1 alleles for the R261Q,
R252W and E280K mutations (Abadie et al. 1989; Lyonnet et al. 1989). The E261Q mutation, which accounts
for 36% of mutant haplotype 1 genes in Mediterranean
countries (Abadie et al. 1989), only accounted for 17%
of haplotype 1 P K U alleles in Portugal. Similarly, the
L249F mutation, first reported here in association with
mutant haplotype 1 at the P A H locus ( P < 0.01), only
accounted for 17% of mutant haplotype 1 genes in Portugal. Taken together, the R261Q and L249F mutations
accounted for only one-third of all mutant haplotype 1
genes in that country. It appears, therefore, that despite
strong linkage disequilibrium between P K U and RFLP
haplotype i at the P A H locus, this mutant haplotype was
genotypically heterogeneous in Portugal. Several mutant
genotypes, including E261Q, L249F and the still unknown
mutations associated with mutant haplotype 1, might
have contributed to the prevalence of this particular
RFLP haplotype and to the general incidence of PKU in
Portugal (1/14500).
The frequency of the other mutant haplotypes was
consistently and markedly reduced. Indeed, haplotypes
