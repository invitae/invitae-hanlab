Summary
We report five novel mutations in the human Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene that cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) or neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism. Each gene defect is a missense mutation

(228Arg-Gln, 139Thr-+Met, 144GlyGlu 63Arg--Met,
and 67Arg-*Cys) that encodes a nonconservative amino
acid alteration. These mutations are each predicted to
be in the Ca2+-sensing receptor's large extracellular domain. In three families with FHH linked to the Ca2+sensing-receptor gene on chromosome 3 and in unrelated individuals probands with FHH, mutations were
not detected in protein-coding sequences. On the basis
of these data and previous analyses, we suggest that
there are a wide range of mutations that cause FHH.
Mutations that perturb the structure and function of the
extracellular or transmembrane domains of the receptor
and those that affect noncoding sequences of the Ca2+sensing-receptor gene can cause FHH.
Introduction

The human Ca2+-sensing receptor plays a critical role
in determining the level of extracellular Ca2+ (Brown et
al. 1993; Pollak et al. 1993). This receptor is expressed
in the parathyroid gland and kidney, where interaction
with Ca2+ inhibits release of parathyroid hormone
(PTH) and modulates renal reabsorption of Ca2+, respectively, by unknown mechanisms. The proposed topology of the bovine Ca2+-sensing receptor (Brown et
al. 1993) is that of a large N-terminal extracellular domain and seven membrane-spanning regions, similar to

that of the metabotropic glutamate and glycoprotein
hormone receptors (Masu et al. 1991). The Ca2"-sensing
receptor's extracellular domain contains regions with a
high density of acidic amino acids that are comparable
to ion-binding sites in low-affinity Ca2"-binding proteins. The seven membrane-spanning regions and intracellular loops are believed to be important for signal
transduction, presumably by coupling to G proteins.
Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH; also
known as familial benign hypercalcemia) and neonatal
severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) can be caused by
mutations in the Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene (Pollak et
al. 1993). FHH is generally an asymptomatic disorder
inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with -100%
penetrance in childhood. Affected individuals exhibit
mild or modest hypercalcemia, relative hypocalciuria,
and inappropriately normal PTH levels (reviewed in
Marx et al. 1981; Attie et al. 1983; Law and Heath
1985). In contrast, NSHPT is a rare life-threatening disorder characterized by very high serum Ca2" concentrations (sometimes >20 mg/dl), skeletal demineralization,
and parathyroid hyperplasia. In some instances NSHPT
has been demonstrated to be the homozygous form of
FHH (Steinmann et al. 1984; Marx et al. 1992) and is
transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait (Pollak et al.
1994b).
Elsewhere, we have reported three mutations that
cause FHH and NSHPT (Pollak et al. 1993). In two
families the mutation is located in the extracellular domain; in another family the defect is in the third intracellular loop of the receptor. To further elucidate the functional consequences of defects in the Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene encoded on chromosome 3, we studied
additional families with these clinical conditions. We
report five novel missense mutations in the extracellular
domain of the Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene in probands
from five FHH families. A mutation was not identified
in three probands from families with FHH linked to
chromosome 3. Collectively, these data suggest that mutations in the large extracellular domain are a common

cause of FHH. We also speculate that gene defects that
perturb expression of the Ca2+-sensing receptor can also
produce this disorder.
Material and Methods
Collection of Samples

Informed consent was obtained from all participants
or their guardians, in accordance with standards established by local institutional review boards for the protection of human subjects from research risks. DNA from
members of 22 unrelated families or individuals with
definite or possible FHH or NSHPT was studied. The
diagnosis of FHH was based on the finding of asymptomatic hypercalcemia accompanied by normal levels of
PTH. The diagnosis of NSHPT was made on the basis
of marked hypercalcemia presenting shortly after birth
and marked elevation of serum PTH levels. Total serum
and urinary calcium concentrations were measured by
colorimetric assays. Detailed clinical and laboratory descriptions of several of these families have been reported
elsewhere.
Amplification of Genomic DNA and RNase Protection Assays

RNase protection assays to detect mutations in the
Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene, described elsewhere (Pollak
et al. 1993; Watkins et al. 1994), involved the following
steps: Genomic DNA was isolated from either peripheral
lymphocytes or Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cell
lines (Holcombe et al. 1987; Jacobs and Celeste 1989).
Ten segments (100-900 bp each) of the Ca2+-sensingreceptor gene encompassing the entire coding region
were amplified by PCR (Pollak et al. 1993). PCR-amplified proband DNA was hybridized to 32P-labeled RNA
probes. The resulting RNA-DNA hybrid was digested
with RNase A (Sigma). The digestion was stopped by
the addition of SDS and proteinase K and analyzed on
a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Riboprobes 1-5
were derived from the restriction fragments of genomic
clones and contained splice donor/acceptor sequences;
riboprobes 6-8 were derived from subclones of a kidney
cDNA. To increase the probability of identifying all mutations, both sense and antisense riboprobes were used.
Amplified DNA samples yielding abnormal RNase
cleavage patterns were reanalyzed with new DNA isolates to exclude artifacts arising from the PCR.

Sequencing of PCR Products
To demonstrate the presence of these mutations in the
Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene in genomic DNA samples,
the relevant PCR product was either sequenced directly
(using the Stratagene Cyclist kit) or subcloned into the
BamHIIEcoRI site of the Bluescript II SK vector (Stratagene) and sequenced (Sequenase kit, USB).
To exclude possible sequence differences that arose

during PCR amplification or cloning, the samples were
reamplified and assayed for the mutation by one of
two techniques. The mutations detected in families I
(63Arg-+Met) and Q (67Arg-*Cys) are predicted to change
a restriction site and were confirmed by digests with
relevant restriction enzymes. Mutations found in families A (228Arg-+Gln), C (139Thr-+Met), and D (144Gly"
Glu) were confirmed by oligo-specific hybridization (Jacobs and Celeste 1989).
LOD Score Calculations
LOD scores were calculated using the computer program MLINK (Ott 1991) assuming recombination distance 0, 100% penetrance, and FHH gene frequency or
mutant allele frequency of .01.
Results
Clinical Data

Affected individuals from 20 families with FHH and!
or NSHPT were studied. Both affected and unaffected
individuals were available for study from eight of these
families. Their pedigrees and clinical evaluations have
been reported elsewhere (families A, B, C, and D in
Chou et al. 1992; family I in Marx et al. 1985; family
P in Menko et al 1983; and families Q and S in Pollak
et al. 1994b). Only one proband was available for study
in the remaining 12 FHH families. The clinical features
of FHH in these probands were not significantly different from those described previously (Marx et al. 1981;
Law and Heath 1985).
RNase Protection Analysis of the Ca2&-Sensing-Receptor Gene
in FHHINSHPT Probands
RNase protection assays were used to screen the six
exons of the Ca2+-sensing receptor, as described elsewhere (Pollak et al. 1993). Riboprobes 1-5 were derived
from subcloned restriction fragments of genomic clones;
riboprobes 6-10 were derived from subclones of a kidney cDNA clone (fig. 1). To increase the probability of
identifying all point mutations or small alterations, both
sense and antisense riboprobes were used.
Genomic DNA from two affected members, each, of
eight kindreds (families A, B, C, D, I, Q, and S) and
12 unrelated FHH probands was amplified using PCR,
followed by RNase protection assay (see Material and
Methods). Sequence variations between the riboprobes
(derived from the wild-type Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene)
and DNA samples from these individuals were recognized by abnormal-sized cleavage products (fig. 1).
DNAs bearing single point mutations generally produce
two abnormal RNA fragments resulting from cleavage
of the riboprobe. Abnormal cleavage bands were found
in exon 2 (705-1,004 bp) from probands of families C,
D, I, and Q and in exon 3 (1,004-1,532 bp) from probands of family A.

Point Mutations in the Ca2'-Sensing Receptor

DNAs yielding aberrant RNase protection patterns
were characterized by nucleotide sequence analysis of
subcloned PCR products (see Material and Methods).
The nucleotide sequences of these variants were independently confirmed either by hybridization to oligonucleotides specific for the nucleotide change or by digestion with a restriction enzyme whose recognition site
was altered by the sequence change (data not shown).
Five novel sequence changes were identified (table 1).
Each of the observed nucleotide changes are predicted
to cause amino acid substitutions in the Ca2"-sensing
receptor.
To demonstrate that these sequence variants are not
common polymorphisms and are associated with disease, two experiments were performed. First, we examined DNAs from 50 normal individuals for the presence
of these mutations. None of the 100 normal chromosomes represented in these individuals had any of the
missense mutations (data not shown). Second, DNAs
from affected and unaffected family members were
tested for the presence of the mutation initially identified
in probands. In each family, the mutation was present
in all DNA samples derived from affected individuals

and was absent from samples derived from all unaffected
family members. The likelihoods that the disease and
the mutation are co-inherited in each of the five families
are indicated in table 1.
RNase protection assays of probands from three families (B, P, and S) and 12 unrelated probands failed to
identify a mutation. To determine whether genetic heterogeneity could account for this finding, linkage studies
were performed in the three families. FHH/NSHPT was
linked to the Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene on chromosome 3 in each of these kindreds. By using the polymorphic locus D3S1303 (Weissenbach et al. 1992), a maximum two-point lod score of 4.52 was achieved in FHH
family B, 4.5 was achieved in FHH family P, and 1.89
was achieved in NSHPT family S. To determine whether
mutations in the splice donor or acceptor sequences
might account for the disorders in these families, small
regions of flanking intron sequences were analyzed (data
not shown); no abnormalities were identified.
Discussion

We describe five sequence variations, found in the
Ca2+-sensing receptor, that cause FHH and NSHPT. All
five sequence variations share three features. First, they
each alter a single nucleotide that changes the encoded
amino acid (228Arg--Gln, 139Thr-+Met, 144GlyGlu,
63Arg-*Met, and 67Arg-+Cys). Second, they are not found
in >100 normal chromosomes. Third, they are co-inherited with disease in the affected individuals' families. We
conclude that all five sequence variations cause FHH.
The Ca2+-sensing receptor is translated from a 5.4-kb
mRNA that is encoded in >20 kb of genomic DNA
(Brown et al. 1993). On the basis of homology with
previously described receptors, the Ca2+-sensing receptor appears to be a member of the G-protein-coupled
receptor superfamily (fig. 2). The consequences of mutations in this receptor may be indirect and alter polypeptide folding, receptor processing, or stability. However,
the distribution of FHH/NSHPT mutations within this
gene suggests that specific structure-function relation-

ships are perturbed by these gene defects. To date, 13
mutations have been reported in exons 2, 3, and 6 (Pollak et al. 1993, 1994b; Pearce et al. 1994; and data in
the present paper). Mutations in exons 2 and 3, which
are postulated to encode the large extracellular domain
of this protein, produce two different phenotypes. While
most of the mutations identified in this region cause
FHH and NSHPT, one mutation, 128Glu-Ala, results in
autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (Pollak et al. 1994a).
The divergent phenotypes associated with these mutations suggest that the extracellular domain is critical for
determining the receptor's affinity or interaction with
Ca2+; mutations within this region appear to reset (up
or down) ion binding and receptor activation. Four mutations have also been identified within exon 6 (Pollak
et al. 1993; Pearce et al. 1994), which encodes the membrane-spanning segments, intracellular loops, and carboxy-terminal tail of the receptor. It seems likely that
FHH produced by these mutations results from perturbation of signal transduction following ligand binding.
It is noteworthy that mutations were not identified in
coding sequences of the Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene, in
splice donor or acceptor sequences (data not shown) in
probands from three families with FHH that is linked to
chromosome 3q, or from 12 individual FHH probands.

While genetic heterogeneity may explain the absence of
mutation detection in the latter group, several studies
(Heath et al. 1993; Pollak et al. 1994b) have demonstrated that most FHH is due to a gene defect at the 3q
locus. RNase protection assays were employed to detect
mutations. Because the sensitivity of mutation detection
by assays that employ both sense and antisense riboprobes is quite high (Kaufman et al. 1990), it is unlikely
that these analyses failed to identify coding sequence
mutations. Our previous studies (MacRae et al. 1994)
suggested that >95% of all missense mutations are detected using these methods. The riboprobes used in these
studies (detailed in Pollak et al. 1993) contained all intron and exon boundaries except those flanking exons
5 and 6. Therefore, most mutations that interrupted
splice signals should have been identified. We presume
that the gene defects in some FHH families are located
in the noncoding sequences but not in the conserved
splice signals immediately 5' and 3' of each exon. These
mutations may cause subtle alterations in the regulated
expression of the Ca2+-sensing-receptor gene or may
have more substantial effects on gene transcription, as
has been recently described in the factor VIII gene
(Naylor et al. 1993). Regardless, it appears that mutations that alter receptor number and/or density can also
cause the FHH phenotype.
The effect of different missense mutations on the hypercalcemic phenotype is difficult to ascertain from these
studies. As multiple different clinical laboratories were
used to measure serum Ca2" levels, we are unable to
draw conclusions regarding the effect of a specific mutation on serum Ca2" concentration. However, affected
individuals in family I (63Arg--Met) had quite mild hypercalcemia. In contrast, one family I member who was
homozygous for this mutation had NSHPT with marked
hypercalcemia (Marx et al. 1985). We conclude that the
potential of a mutation to cause life-threatening disease
in the homozygous state cannot be predicted from the
heterozygous phenotype.
We suggest that many mutations within the Ca2+sensing receptor cause FHH, NSHPT, or familial hypocalcemia. Of the 13 mutations identified to date, each
are unique, implying little if any founder effect in these
disorders. In view of the mild symptoms associated with
FHH and the absence of any effect on the reproductive
fitness in affected individuals, it also seems possible that
individuals with mild asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism and/or borderline hypercalcemia may actually have
mutations (or polymorphisms) in their Ca2+-sensing-receptor genes.
