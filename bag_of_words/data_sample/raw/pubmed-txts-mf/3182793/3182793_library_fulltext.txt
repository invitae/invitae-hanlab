constructed from NcoI cassettes (Table I) containing the entirecoding
sequence. The NcoI cassettes were subcloned in pUC-N. The HindIII
(H)-EcoRI ( E ) fragments from pUC-N were used to replace the
HindIII-HpaI (Hp) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fragment of
pRSV-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (13) to create pRSV-ADA.

recommended by the manufacturer (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). The reaction included 1pg of genomic DNA, 5 mM potassium chloride, 10 mM
Tris, pH 8.3, 1.5 mM magnesium chloride, 0.01% (w/v) gelatin, 200
p~ each dNTP, 1 p~ each primer in a total volume of 100 pl. The
DNA wasinitially denatured for 10 min at 92 "C and 2.5 units of Taq
polymerase was added. Successive cycles were annealing at 37 "C for
2 min, extension at 72 "C for 5 min, and denaturing at 92 "C for 2
min. During the final cycle extension time was increased to 10 min.
Oligonucleotideprimers complimentary to bases 24787 through 24810
and 25458 through 25481 of the ADA gene (2) were synthesized on
an Applied Biosystems 380A DNA synthesizer and purified on a20%
acrylamide sequencing gel. Amplification gave a 694-bp fragment
which included a portion of intron 3, the entireexon 4, and a portion
of intron 4. A 520-bp Sad-BglII fragment of the amplified DNA was
cloned into M13 and sequenced as described above. To minimize the
possibility of misreading by either the Taq polymerase used in amplification or reverse transcriptase used in sequencing, six independent M13 clones were analyzed.
Plasmid Construction-An NcoI site was generated in the multiple
cloning site of pUC12 by filling in the ends of an NcoI fragment of
hADA194 (2) with Klenow polymerase and inserting the fragment by
blunt-end ligation into the SmaI site of pUC12. The NcoI fragment
was removed by NcoI digestion and the vector ligated to itself. The
resulting vector, designated pUC-N, was used to subclone the NcoI
ADA cassettes. These cassettes were NcoI fragments of the cDNAs
containing the entire protein-coding sequence of ADA (Fig. 1A). A
normal, wild-type ADA cassette was assembled using the 1457-bp
NcoI fragment of pADA211 (6). Three mutant ADA cassettes, each

including one of the point mutations of interest, were derived from
the pBR322 clone 2606-13A (Fig. 2), and from clones 2756-13b and
2756-15 (3). A full-length ADA cDNA (pBR17/20), lacking exon 4
was generated by cutting the pBR322 clones 2825A-20 and 2825A17b (3) with StuI and HindIII and ligating the 4.4-kb fragment of
2825A-17b with the 1.4-kb fragment of 2825A-20. The 1243-bp NcoI
fragment of pBR17/20 was used as a mutant ADA cassette without
exon 4.
The ADA expression vectors were constructed by removing the
chloroamphenicol acetyltransferase sequences of pRSV-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (obtained from Bruce Howard, National
Cancer Institute) (13) and inserting the ADA cassettes to generate
pRSV-ADA (Fig. 1B). TheADA cassettes were removed from pUCN by digesting with EcoRI, blunting the EcoRI ends, and cutting
with HindIII. The resulting HindIII blunt-end cassette was ligated
with the RSV-LTR-containing fragment of pRSV-chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase generated by HindIII-HpuI digestion. Table I shows
the mutations and affected amino aidsof each ADA-deficient cell line
and thecDNA clones used in assembly of the pRSV-ADA expression
vectors.
Fibroblast Culture and Transfection-The human fibroblast cell
line GM4429 was selected as host cell because of the relatively low
level of endogenous ADA activity and theknown efficiency of transfections into fibroblasts. The cells were maintained in a-minimal
essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10 mM
HEPES. The day before transfection the cells were plated at 1.0-1.3
X lo6 cells/plate (100 X 15-mm size). Plasmid DNA was transfected
by the calcium phosphate-DNA method of Gorman et al. (13) without
glycerol shock. Each plate of cells was cotransfected with 5 pgof
DNA from one of the pRSV-ADA plasmids, 2 pg of pRSV-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid DNA, and 28 pgof carrier plasmid
DNA (pUC18). Control cells were transfected with 2 pgof pRSVchloramphenicol acetyltransferase, 28 pgof carrier plasmid DNA,
and 5 pg of pRSV-Tn5-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (13). This
gave an equivalent amount of RSV-controlled plasmid in each transfection. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed
with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mM EDTA and fed with
a-minimal essential medium. Cells were harvested for assay of ADA
and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity or for RNA isolation,
48 h after transfection.
Measurement of ADA and ChloramphenicolAcetyltransferase Activities-The cells were harvested by trypsinization and aliquots
counted with a Coulter counter. The cells were pelleted, washed in 40
mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM EDTA, and then
suspended in 5 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA.
Lysates were made by rapid freeze-thawing of the suspended cells in
liquid nitrogen. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation and
lysates were stored a t -70 "C. ADA activity was assayed by monitoring the conversion of ["Cladenosine to ['4C]inosine by2-10 p1 of
lysate (14). The results were calculated as pmoles of inosine produced/
min/106cells. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was assayed
by incubation of cell lysates with ['4C]chloroamphenico1and acetylCoA followed by thin layer chromatography (13). Activity was expressed as pmoles of acetylated ['4C]chlor~amphenic~l
products/
minute/1o6 cells.
Isolation and Analysis of ADAmRNA-Cells
were harvested in
guanidine thiocyanate, and RNA was isolated by cesium chloride
gradient centrifugation (9). Twenty pgof total cellular RNA was
electrophoresed in an 1%agarose-formaldehyde gel and blot transferred to Pall Biodyne A membrane (15). To visualize ADA mRNA,
the membrane was hybridized with a 1457-bp NcoI fragment of
normal ADA cDNA, pADA211 (6) that was labeled by random oligonucleotide priming and [cY-~'P]~CTP
(16).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Structure of Mutant ADAAlleles-In
previous work, we
analyzed four ADA alleles from two patients with inherited
ADA deficiency (3). In thispaper, we report the ADA cDNA
sequence of both alleles from a third cell line, GM2606. Each
ADA allele of GM2606 has a single point mutation affecting
the amino acid sequence. In theallele represented by the fulllength clone 2606-13a (Fig. 2), base 396 in exon 4 is T rather
than theC found in the consensus ADA sequence. This is the
first base of the codon for amino acid 101 and results in an
Arg to Trp change. In the ADA-deficient cell line GM1715,

mids in which the normal cDNA is replaced with one of the
mutant ADA cDNA cassettes, pADA-Vah, pADA-Hiszll,
pADA-Trplol, or pADA-del 4, had activities comparable to
the level of endogenous ADA activity found in control cells.
The level of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity varied
2.5-fold but was independent of the type of pRSV-ADA vector
cotransfected. When ADA activity was normalized against
transfected chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity after
subtracting endogenous ADA activity, cells transfected with
normal ADA cDNA had activities a t least 40 times higher
than cells transfected with mutant ADA cDNAs.

Expression of Mutant ADA
RNA blot analysis was used to detect ADA mRNA in the
transfected cells (Fig. 5). Endogenous ADA mRNA was detected in control cells cotransfected with pRSV-Tn5-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase and pRSV-chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase (Fig. 5, lane a). Cells transfected with
pADA-Trplol, pADA-His211,pADA-Va1329, and pADA-WT
(Fig. 5, lanes c-f) had ADA mRNAs of approximately 1.6 kb,
the same size as the endogenous message.However, ADA
message levels were 15-25-fold higher in cells transfected with
these vectors than incells transfected with plasmids that did
not contain ADA sequences. The predominant ADA mRNA
species in cells transfected with pADA-del4 was only about
1.4 kb (Fig. 5 , lane b). ADA message of 1.4 kb could only have
been transcribed from the transfected vector and not from
the endogenous gene. Since the intensity of the 1.4-kb band
is approximately equivalent to the intensity of the 1.6-kb
band for cells transfected with the other ADA vectors, the
increased ADA message levels must be derived from the
transfected vectors and not the endogenous gene. Thus, the
failure of the mutant ADA constructions to show increased
expression of ADA activity is a reflection of the effect of the
mutations on protein stability and/or catalytic activity and
not thelevel of transcription or stability of the mRNA.
Computer-generated analysis of protein secondary structure (22) and hydropathicity (23) can be used to estimate the
effect of mutations on ADA protein. The alteration of Arg101 to Trp-101 found in one allele of GM2606 causes a large
shift of the adjacent amino acid structure (amino acids 98105) from relatively neutral to decidedly hydrophobic (Fig.
6A). Further, this amino acid change creates the possibility
for a turn in the predicted 0-sheet at the adjacent Tyr-102.
GM2606 and GM2756 share a common mutant ADA protein
with Arg-211 changed to His-211. With this mutation the
region from amino acids 208-213 becomes decidedly more
hydrophobic (Fig. 6B).
The
ADA-deficient cell lines
GM2825A and GM2756 have a common mutation of Ala-329
to Val-329. However each cell line expresses the mutation
from a unique allele (3). The Ala-329 to Val-329 substitution
has virtually no effect on the predicted hydropathicity (Fig.
6C) or predicted secondary structure of ADA even though the

FIG.6. Hydopathicity profiles (23) of regions of the ADA
protein affected by point mutations. Regions above the line (0)
are hydrophilic (+) and regions below the line are hydrophobic (-).
The solid lines are the profiles for normal ADA protein, and the
dashed lines are the profiles for the mutant ADA proteins. Amino
acids, in the one-letter code, are numbered and the mutations are
indicated with asterisks.

amino acid change does have adramatic effect on ADA
activity. The deletion of exon 4 in mRNA transcribed from
one ADA allele of GM2825A does not alter thetranslational
reading frame. This deletion has dramatic effects on the
predicted protein structure, as 48 amino acids are eliminated.
Further, amino acids encoded in exon 4 must be essentialfor
ADA stability and/or function, as mutations of Lys-80 to Arg80 in GM2471(4),and Arg-101 to Trp-101 in GM2606 and to
Gln-101 in GM1715 (5) occur within this region.
Despite near normal levels of translatable ADA mRNA
(24),we have found that theADA-deficient cell lines GM2606,
GM2756, and GM2825A have 10%or less of the immunoprecipitable ADA protein and ADA catalytic activity found in
normal cells (25). The detection of immunoreactive material
clearly shows that ADA protein is made in these ADAdeficient lines. We found similar results with our expression

system, where both normal and mutant constructions led to
approximately equivalent transcription of ADA mRNA but
the ADA mutant constructions failed to generate enzymati+1.6kb
cally active protein. On the basis of this information and the
+1.4kb
predicted effects of the mutationson ADA structure, we
believe that thefailure to detect appreciable levels of mutant
ADA protein and catalytic activity is theresult of alterations
of protein structure and/or decreased protein stability. This
does not exclude the possibility that the mutations may also
directly affect the ADA active site. Analysis of mutations
affecting ADA may be crucial in further characterization of
the enzyme structure and mechanism. Of course analysis of
