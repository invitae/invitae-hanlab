Abstract
Six different substitution mutations were identified in four different amino acid residues of antithrombin strand 1C and the
polypeptide leading into strand 4B (F402S, F402C, F402L,
A404T, N405K, and P407T), and are responsible for functional antithrombin deficiency in seven independently ascertained kindreds (Rosny, Torino, Maisons-Laffitte, Paris 3, La
Rochelle, Budapest 5, and Oslo) affected by venous thromboembolic disease. In all seven families, variant antithrombins
with heparin-binding abnormalities were detected by crossed
immunoelectrophoresis, and in six of the kindreds there was a
reduced antigen concentration of plasma antithrombin. Two of
the variant antithrombins, Rosny and Torino, were purified by
heparin-Sepharose and immunoaffinity chromatography, and
shown to have greatly reduced heparin cofactor and progressive
inhibitor activities in vitro. The defective interactions of these
mutants with thrombin may result from proximity of s1C to the
reactive site, while reduced circulating levels may be related to
siC proximity to highly conserved internal ft strands, which
contain elements proposed to influence serpin turnover and intracellular degradation. In contrast, siC is spatially distant to
the positively charged surface which forms the heparin binding
site of antithrombin; altered heparin binding properties of siC
variants may therefore reflect conformational linkage between
the reactive site and heparin binding regions of the molecule.
This work demonstrates that point mutations in and immediately adjacent to strand 1C have multiple, or pleiotropic, effects
on this serpin, leading ultimately to failure of its regulatory
function. (J. Clin. Invest. 1992. 90:2422-2433.) Key words:

Introduction
Antithrombin is a member of the serine proteinase inhibitor
(serpin) superfamily ( 1 ). Its main function is the regulation of
blood coagulation proteinases, such as thrombin, that are generated during coagulation activation (2-4). Antithrombin has
two distinct functional domains: one (the reactive site) interacts with the proteinase, and the other binds to heparin. MainteAddress correspondence to David A. Lane, Ph.D., Department of Haematology, Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, Hammersmith, London W6 8RP, United Kingdom.

nance of an adequate level, > 70%, of functional antithrombin
activity in blood is essential to ensure effective inhibition of
coagulation proteinases: inheritance of genetic defects that
lower the absolute amount of antithrombin (type I), or that
produce inactive (variant) forms of the inhibitor (type II), predispose to familial thrombotic disorders (5, 6).
Numerous variants ofantithrombin have now been characterized at the molecular level (7). Mutations that alter the reactive site (types Ha and HIb) are generally located near the
COOH terminus of the molecule, while heparin binding defects (type IIc) (classification according to Sas et al. [8, 9 ] ) are
usually caused by single amino acid substitutions near the NH2
terminus.
We have studied seven different families in which the propositi suffered thromboembolic disorders and were found to
have reduced levels of functional antithrombin. We show here
that variant proteins are produced in each case and we identify
the genetic abnormalities responsible for the altered functional
properties of the antithrombins. Amongst these seven families,
there are six different point mutations leading to single amino
acid substitutions in the 402-407 region of the antithrombin
protein. These substitutions have pleiotropic (multiple) effects; they alter the reactive site and heparin-binding properties
of the variant antithrombins, and decrease their circulating levels in most cases.

Methods

Family histories
The descriptions of the family histories that follow should be considered together with the antithrombin assay results summarized in Table I.

Case I
18-yr-old male from the town of Rosny, France, was referred for

An

investigation in August 1989, because of a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).' At the age of 15 yr, he developed a spontaneous superficial vein thrombosis of the right leg. 2 yr later, he had a DVT (diagnosed by venography), 7 d after appendectomy. He was treated with
heparin, followed by oral anticoagulants for a period of 7 mo. Repeated
echo-Doppler studies showed persistence of obstruction of the left superficial femoral and iliac veins. Antithrombin deficiency was diagnosed on the basis of reduced levels of activity and antigen in plasma,
with the former being consistently lower than the latter (activity 52%,
antigen 70%).
His mother, aged 37 yr, originating from Gabon, also has antithrombin deficiency (activity 46%, antigen 60%). She had a clinically
diagnosed left calf vein thrombosis at the age of 26 yr, while receiving
estroprogestogen. It should be noted that she has had three pregnancies
1. Abbreviations used in this paper: CIE, crossed immunoelectrophoresis; DVT, deep vein thrombosis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.

without prophylactic anticoagulant treatment (one before and two
after the thrombosis) and that she also received estroprogestogen after
her second pregnancy: no other episodes of thrombosis were observed.
The propositus has no contact with his father who could not therefore
be examined.

Case 2
A 16-yr-old male from Torino, Italy, was referred for investigation after
a DVT of the right leg. Possible predisposing events were repeated
trauma of the same leg 1 wk and 1 mo before. The thrombosis was
confirmed by echo-Doppler and computerized tomography: popliteal,
superficial femoral, and iliac veins were occluded. He was treated first
with urokinase together with heparin. Levels of antithrombin were determined to be low (activity 46%, antigen 69%) and were taken to
indicate increased consumption; consequently, he received antithrombin concentrates ( 1,000 U on day 2; 2,000 U on day 3; 3,000 U from
day 5-10). Warfarin was started on day 10 and heparin stopped on day
13. Oral anticoagulants were continued for 6 mo. Echo-Doppler performed at 4 mo showed a thrombosis up to the iliac vein and a collateral circulation by the internal saphenous vein. Antithrombin levels in
his parents and his sister were normal and there was no family history
of thrombosis.

Case 3
This involves an affected man (activity 56%, antigen 73%) from Maisons-Laffitte, France, with only one episode ofleft calfvein thrombosis
at the age of 55 yr. He was referred for familial thromboembolic antecedents: his sister, aged 40 yr, developed a left ilio-femoral venous
thrombosis with pulmonary embolism at the age of 28 yr, after a knee
ligamentoplasty performed without interruption of estroprogestative
pill. She was treated with oral anticoagulants for 2 yr without a further
episode of thrombosis. At the age of 30 yr, she received prophylactic
anticoagulant treatment for 2 yr after knee surgery. Despite her thrombosis, her antithrombin levels in plasma appear to be normal (activity
105%, antigen 104%).
An affected (antithrombin activity 55%, antigen 75%) son of the
propositus, 32 yr old, developed a spontaneous left ilio-femoral thrombosis at the age of 17 yr. He was treated with heparin followed by oral
anticoagulants for 2 yr. 10 yr later he developed a spontaneous ilio-femoral thrombosis and for the last 3 yr has been treated with acenocoumarol, without recurrence of thrombotic episodes.
Two other sons, 26 and 18 yr old, have no history ofthrombosis and
their antithrombin levels are normal. A 25-yr-old unaffected (i.e., with
normal antithrombin levels) nephew (son of an unaffected brother),
however, presented with a left calfvein thrombosis after appendectomy
at the age of 17 yr. After 1 yr of treatment on acenocoumarol, this was
discontinued and he has been free of recurrences for 3 yr.
The occurrence of thrombosis in this third family, often present in
association with normal antithrombin levels, suggests a second independent abnomality, the nature of which is presently unknown.

Case 4
The propositus of the antithrombin Paris 3 kindred is a 41-yr-old male
(antithrombin activity 48%, antigen 72%). At the age of 20 yr he had a
fracture of the right malleolus which required a plaster cast for 40 ds:
calf oedema followed cast removal. At the age of 35 yr, surgery was
planned for inguinal hernia and, as his mother and two sisters were also
known to be antithrombin deficient (Table I), he was examined for
thrombosis by echo-Doppler: signs of previous right femoro-popliteal
thrombosis were found. At the age of 39 yr, he experienced superficial
thrombosis which was treated with a low molecular weight heparin.
After another thrombotic episode, echo-Doppler demonstrated sequelae of right and left side DVT. Consequently, he has been put on
long-term oral anticoagulants.
One affected sister (antithrombin activity 60%, antigen 78%), aged
44 yr, has had repeated DVT and pulmonary embolism after deliveries
and an induced abortion. A second affected sister (activity 54%, antigen 70%), aged 51 yr has had no thrombosis, despite having three

children. One ofthese children is antithrombin deficient (activity 58%,
antigen 65%) and has had a DVT. Furthermore, the mother of the
propositus, 71 yr, had postpartum superficial thrombosis at 17 yr, followed by a second thrombosis during the next pregnancy. At 62 yr she
experienced ilio-femoral thrombosis, which was treated with long-term
oral anticoagulants.

Case 5
The propositus (antithrombin activity 55%, antigen 73%) of the antithrombin La Rochelle kindred had repeated sprains between the ages
of 17 and 28 yr, the last one being associated with pain and oedema.
Diagnosis of DVT was suggested for the first time when he was 28 yr,
after leg pain. Repeated episodes of dyspnoea culminated in investigation by venography, which revealed a previous left and recent right
thrombosis. He received heparin, and during treatment a pulmonary
embolism was confirmed by lung scan. Urokinase/plasminogen treatment was given and a vena caval interruption was performed. For the
last 14 yr, he has been given oral anticoagulants.
His mother, who also has reduced antithrombin levels (activity
55%, antigen 54%), is now 67 yr old and experienced no thrombotic
problems following an appendectomy at 18 yr and her first three pregnancies. She experienced a left DVT after the fourth delivery and has
had repeated episodes of superficial thrombophlebitis. She is not
treated with long-term oral anticoagulants.
His sister (antithrombin activity 56%, antigen 60%), aged 44 yr,
developed a left calf DVT at 22 yr: thrombosis was associated with
prolonged bed rest after influenza. She was treated with heparin for 48
h and oral anticoagulants were begun, but the DVT extended up the
thigh and into the pelvis. Heparin was given again and after a move to
oral anticoagulants she developed a DVT of the right leg. Additional
episodes of DVT were investigated by venography, which revealed extensive thrombosis of the right femoral, external, and common iliac
veins. Recurrency of thrombosis after stopping anticoagulants has lead
to oral anticoagulation for the past 20 yr.

Case 6
This involves a family from Budapest, Hungary, with an extensive
pedigree and a history of severe thrombotic episodes. A combination of
at least two defects (antithrombin and protein C deficiencies), which
apparently segregate separately, can explain the severe thrombosis. A
comprehensive report of the family history has appeared elsewhere
(10). While only the propositus was investigated in the present study
(antithrombin activity 70%, antigen 100%), it is instructive to review
briefly the family history. Of 10 brothers and 2 sisters, at least 2 siblings
died of pulmonary embolism at an early age (21 and 16 yr). Two other
children died without definite (autopsy) diagnosis. Four other family
members with functional antithrombin deficiency suffered from severe
thromboembolism at 15, 19, 23, and 46 yr and survived. Three family
members (the grandmother and two brothers) with functional antithrombin deficiency have not developed thrombosis. Available antithrombin levels, including those reported elsewhere ( 10), are listed in
Table I.

Case 7
Case 7 involves an antithrombin deficient kindred from Oslo, Norway.
Details of the family history are contained in a report ( 11 ) that was the
first to recognize an association between inherited antithrombin deficiency and venous thrombosis. More recently, Hultin et al. ( 12) analyzed plasma from members of this family by crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) in the presence of heparin and observed a cathodal variant protein in affected individuals. While the inheritance of
antithrombin deficiency and its association with thrombosis is well
documented in this family, a brief updated summary is required. The
propositus (antithrombin activity 50%, antigen 48%) has had several,
severe thromboses involving obstruction of the mesenteric veins, necessitating removal of much of his small bowel. Of 25 family members
investigated, 12 were found to have functional antithrombin deficiency
(see Table I). Eight of these individuals have had DVT, and in seven

this was recurrent. The mean age of onset of the first DVT was 19 yr
of age.

Protein investigations
Assays of antithrombin levels in plasma were performed by antigen
and functional methods. Antigen levels of cases 1-6 were measured
using Nor Partigen plates (Behringwerke, Marburg, FRG) or a nephelometric method (Nephelometric Analyzer, Behringwerke), while the
functional assay employed a heparin cofactor method using either S
2222 (KabiVitrum, Uxbridge, UK), or Dupont reagents and an ACA
SX Instrument. Functional and immunological antithrombin levels
for case 7 were determined as previously described ( 1 1, 13, 14).
CIE was performed with heparin in the first dimension (9, 15), as
described ( 12, 16). The polyclonal antibodies were purchased from
DakoPatts (High Wycombe, UK) and Behringwerke.
Normal pooled plasma was prepared by centrifugation of citrated
blood from healthy laboratory staff. Citrated plasma was also prepared
from the propositi, all of whom are shown to be heterozygous for variant antithrombins (hereafter termed antithrombins Rosny, Torino,
Maisons-Laffitte, Paris 3, La Rochelle, Budapest 5, and Oslo). An-

tithrombin was isolated from normal plasma and from the propositi
with antithrombins Rosny and Torino (insufficient plasma was available from the other families) by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden) (16, 17). Plasma
(- 30 ml) was applied to the column in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,
containing 0.4 M NaCl: plasma with antithrombin Rosny was subject
to a preliminary precipitation step with dextran sulphate. Under the
conditions used, approximately half of the antithrombin in each case
did not bind to the column and was recovered in the breakthrough
fraction containing most of the plasma; when the same quantity of
normal plasma was applied to the same column, minimal amounts
(barely detectable) of antithrombin did not bind. The breakthrough
fractions from the patients' plasmas were separately pooled. The abilities of the two pools to form thrombin-antithrombin complex were
studied using an immunoassay (see below). The variant antithrombins
were then isolated from these pooled fractions by immuno-affinity
chromatography on immobilized polyclonal antibody (DakoPatts) to
normal antithrombin ( 18 ). The samples were applied to the column in
0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 M NaCl and 0.5% (vol/vol)
Tween 80. Elution was achieved with 4.5 M MgCl2 in 0.25 M Tris HCl,

pH 6.9 (19), after extensive washing with the application buffer. Normal antithrombin was also isolated from plasma using this column. For
kinetic studies, the antithrombins (normal and variant) were subjected
to an additional purification step on ion exchange chromatography, to
remove any contaminating heparin from the heparin-Sepharose
step (20).
The abilities of the variant antithrombins (Rosny and Torino) in
pooled breakthrough fractions to form thrombin-antithrombin complex were compared to that of antithrombin in normal plasma using a
commercial assay (Enzygnost-TAT; Behringwerke). Samples were diluted to give a final antithrombin concentration (determined by Nor
Partigen plates) of 5.38 nM and then incubated at 370C with human a
thrombin (a kind gift from Dr. Jean-Marie Freyssinet, Institute d'Hematologie et d'Immunologie, Strasbourg, France), 27.8 nM, in 50 mM
Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% (wt/vol) sodium azide, pH 7.8. Complex formation was compared in the absence and presence of 0.015
IU/ml heparin (Leo Laboratories, Princes Risborough, UK). After the
addition of thrombin, aliquots (20 ,u) were removed at timed intervals
and immediately reacted with 5 Ml of 1,000 U/ml hirudin (kindly supplied by Dr. R. Wallace, Ciba Geigy, Horsham, UK). Before assay, the
inhibited reaction mixtures were diluted fivefold in normal plasma.

a

SDS PAGE and immunoblotting were performed under nonreducing conditions using 10-15% Phast Gels (Pharmacia) and rabbit antiantithrombin polyclonal antibody (DakoPatts), as described (21 ).
The reaction of purified antithrombin (normal antithrombin and
antithrombins Rosny and Torino) with thrombin was studied at 37Â° C
in the absence of heparin. Purified human thrombin (20 nM) was
incubated with various concentrations ofantithrombins (see Fig. 5) in
0. 15 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% polyethylene
glycol 6,000 (18, 22). At different times, subsamples were withdrawn
and added to cuvettes containing the chromogenic substrate S2238
(KabiVitrum) to determine residual thrombin activity. Relative velocity, V/V., where Vo is the initial velocity, of substrate hydrolysis was
plotted against time.

DNA amplification and direct sequencing
Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of each
ofthe subjects investigated. For all cases, the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was used to amplify specifically segments of the antithrombin
gene that encode the seven exons and flanking intron sequences. Oligonucleotide primers and thermal cycling conditions have been described
previously (23-25). One of a pair of amplification primers was 5'-bio-

tinylated to allow preparation of single stranded template from the
amplified DNA using magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin; Dynal Ltd., Wirral, UK) and a magnetic particle concentrator
(MPC-E; Dynal Ltd.) (26). Single-stranded DNA was directly sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. For each
of the seven propositi, the total coding region and the intron-exon
boundaries of the antithrombin gene were sequenced.

Restriction endonuclease digestion of the PCR products
and haplotype analysis
Restriction enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim
(Lewes, UK) and used according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Digested PCR products were visualized under ultraviolet light, after
agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium-bromide staining. Where possible the mutations identified by direct sequencing were confirmed by
restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products, DNA from a panel of 50
normal subjects serving as controls.
Three polymorphic sites within the antithrombin locus were used
to construct haplotypes of the mutant alleles for antithrombins Oslo
and Paris 3; a 5'-end length polymorphism (27), a PstI site polymorphism within exon 4 (28), and a DdeI site polymorphism within intron
5 (29).

Allele-specific priming of the PCR

For the single base substitution identified in the antithrombin Rosny
gene, allele-specific priming of the PCR was used to confirm the presence of the mutation and to screen the panel of 50 normal individuals.
Under appropriate conditions, the mutant allele-specific oligonucleotide (5 '-GAAAGGCCTGTTGGCGTTGC, mutation site underlined), in combination with a normal sequence upstream primer (5'GCTGTGTCTGTGGATGATTTA), resulted in the amplification of
a 18 l-bp fragment in the presence of the mutation, but not in its absence. The efficiency of amplification was controlled as previously de-

scribed (24).

Confirmation offamily relationships

The genetic relationships of the antithrombin Torino kindred were
investigated by analyzing genomic DNA from family members with a
panel of probes known to be specific for hypervariable regions of human DNA (30); these were kindly supplied by Professor Alec Jeffiries,
Leicester University, UK. Genomic DNA from the propositus, his sister, and both parents was completely digested with the restriction endonuclease Hinf I (Boehringer Mannheim, Lewes, UK). The DNA was

electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose and blotted onto nylon membrane
(Hybond N; Amersham Int'l., Amersham, UK). The membrane was
prehybridized for 1 h at 650C in 0.5 M sodium phosphate, 7% SDS, 1
mM EDTA, pH 7.2. A panel of human minisatellite probes (MS1,
MS2, MS29, MS3 1, MS43, MS5 1, pXG3) was labeled with [32P]dCTP
by random priming and was hybridized to the membrane at 65Â° C
overnight. The membrane was then washed in 2x standard saline citrate (0.3 M NaCl, 30 mM sodium citrate) at 65Â° C, followed by high
stringency washes at the same temperature in 0.1 x standard saline
citrate, 0.1% SDS for 15 min each. Autoradiography was performed
overnight at -80Â° C.

Results
Antithrombin activity levels were decreased in all cases and,
with the exception ofantithrombin Budapest 5, this was accompanied by a reduction in antithrombin antigen levels (Table I).
Antigen levels were not, however, reduced in proportion to
functional activity levels for six out of seven cases in this series,
suggesting the possibility of dysfunctional variant proteins.
Plasma samples from all seven families were subjected to CIE
with heparin in the first dimension to investigate this possibility (Fig. 1 ). Under conditions where normal plasma produced
a characteristic fast moving component and a very much
smaller slower moving component, plasmas from the propositi
showed reduced normal, fast moving components and increased slower moving fractions. In the case ofplasma samples
from affected heterozygotes of the Torino, Paris 3, La Rochelle,
Budapest 5, and Oslo kindreds, the slow moving variant peaks
(mutant gene products) were clearly of reduced size relative to
the fast moving peaks (normal gene products). Relatively reduced concentrations of the variants were not apparent from
CIE of antithrombin Rosny and Maisons-Laffitte plasmas, as
might have been expected from the antigen assay results in
Table I, but it should be noted that this electrophoretic technique is not fully quantitative. For all seven kindreds studied
here, the areas under the cathodal variant peaks were substantially greater than that observed for the variant peak from antithrombin Utah, a previously identified substitution mapping
to the same region of the antithrombin molecule (31 ).
Antithrombins Rosny and Torino were isolated using hepa-

rin-Sepharose chromatography as a preliminary step. Plasma
samples were applied in 0.4 M NaCi and the majority of their
slow moving components did not bind to the column, Fig. 2.
The ability ofthese variant antithrombin fractions to inactivate
thrombin was studied using a thrombin-antithrombin complex immunoassay. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the variant antithrombins from both patients did not form thrombin-antithrombin complexes, either in the absence or presence ofhepann.
The variants were further purified from the heparin-Sepharose column breakthrough fractions by application to and elution from an anti-antithrombin-Sepharose column. They were

After removal of trace contaminating heparin from these
antithrombin variant preparations, kinetic experiments were
performed to investigate their abilities to inactivate thrombin.
A normal antithrombin preparation isolated from normal
plasma by chromatography on the immobilized anti-antithrombin column served as a control. As can be seen in Fig. 5,
while the normal antithrombin was effective in inhibiting
thrombin, only minimal inhibitory effects were observed with
the variant protein preparations.
Sequence analysis of the antithrombin genes for families in
this series revealed a variety of single base substitutions in the
region of exon 6 corresponding to residues 402-407, Fig. 6.

The remaining families had mutations in the codons for
amino acid residues 404, 405, and 407. Antithrombins Panis 3
and Oslo had mutations in codon 404 QCC to ACC, Ala to
Thr. The antithrombin Oslo gene segregated with the S allele of
the 5'-end length polymorphism, the (+) allele for the exon 4
Pstl site polymorphism and the (+) allele for the intron 5 DdeI
site polymorphism. The mutant Paris 3 gene differed at the
5 '-end polymorphic site, being linked to the F allele. This analysis shows that the Oslo and Panis 3 mutations, although having
the same nucleotide substitution, are linked with different haplotypes, which supports an independent origin of the mutations.
Antithrombin La Rochelle had an AAC to AAG mutation
resulting in a substitution 405 Asn to Lys, and antithrombin
Budapest 5 had a CCT to ACT mutation resulting in a substitution 407 Pro to Thr. This latter nucleotide substitution removes a cleavage site for Stul; restriction analysis of amplified
exon 6 DNA with StuI confirmed the presence of a single copy
of the mutant allele in the propositus and its absence in the
normal subject pool.
Sequencing of all seven exons and the intron-exon boundaries in the antithrombin gene identified no other mutations in
the seven propositi, except the propositus, with antithrombin
La Rochelle was also found to canry the mutation -3 GTG to
GAG, Val to Glu. This mutation has been previously described
in several kindreds (7, 32) and appears not to be responsible for
antithrombin deficiency.

Discussion
The affected seven propositi (and their families) investigated in
this study presented in a manner that is typical for molecular
abnormalities of coagulation inhibitors causing thrombophilia
(33), i.e., the propositi have early onset thromboembolic disease and/or there is an association (not always exact) between
phenotype (reduced functional antithrombin plasma assay results) and thrombosis within the families. We have shown the
presence of seven variant antithrombins that are functionally
impaired in the plasmas of these families and have identified
their molecular basis as single amino acid substitutions within
the primary sequence 402-407. The absence of other significant sequence variations within the mutant antithrombin

genes and failure to detect such substitutions in 100 genes from
normal healthy individuals, is consistent with the identified
mutations being responsible for variant protein production. A
notable feature of these mutations is their pleiotropic or multiple effects upon the variant proteins. In this study of the variants we have demonstrated that mutations within or adjacent
to antithrombin strand IC can impair both the function of the
reactive site and heparin binding, as well as causing a reduction
in the plasma level of the protein (in all but one case).
The present findings must be considered in the context of
previous studies of antithrombin variants. A number of amino
acid substitutions in or around the reactive site of antithrombin have been shown to alter its inhibitor function (the fully
reported cases are illustrated in Fig. 7 ). Substitution of PI residue 393 Arg by Cys, His, and Pro, and P2 residue 392 Gly by
Asp, all completely block the inhibitor-proteinase reaction (20,
34-39). Substitution of P1' residue 394 Ser by Leu (40, 41)
drastically impairs the function of the reactive site when
thrombin is the target proteinase, but has less effect upon inhibitory function against Factor Xa (42). Substitution of PlO0 and
P12 residues, 384 Ala and 382 Ala, respectively (38, 43, 44),
causes the inhibitory reaction to be transformed into a substrate reaction in which the reactive bond is completely cleaved
by the proteinase (23, 45, 46). Substrate reactions have also
been demonstrated for other serpins that have amino acid substitutions or insertions in the P1I2-PlO region (47, 48).
Heparin binding to antithrombin is demonstrably altered
by some amino acid substitutions. An antithrombin heparin
binding site has been proposed on the basis of genetic data ( 18,
49-58), together with information from chemical modification experiments ( 59-6 1) and the properties of the glycosylation isoform, antithrombin-f3 (62, 63). It consists of a surface
of high positive charge density around helix D and the NH2-terminal sequence of antithrombin which is not present on other
serpins. Some of the variant antithrombins with altered heparim binding properties have amino acid substitutions that directly affect basic amino acids (e.g., 24 Arg, 47 Arg, 129 Arg),
while others have those that are thought to alter the conformation of the binding domain (e.g., 41 Pro, 99 Leu).
The variant forms of antithrombin considered above have
been described as having "simple" phenotypes, characterized
by defective thrombin interactions in the presence of normal

heparin binding, or normal thrombin inhibition in the presence of defective heparin binding. Furthermore, the circulating
concentrations ofthe proteins encoded by the normal and variant alleles in the heterozygous patients are usually similar, and
the plasma antithrombin antigen concentration is near normal. In contrast, a total of eight different substitution mutants
leading to antithrombin deficiency have now been identified in
five positions of the 402-407 region (this report; [31, 64] ), see
Fig. 7, and these exhibit pleiotropic defects. Fig. 8 shows a
sequence alignment for COOH-terminal "activation peptides"
of antithrombin, a1-antitrysin, and ovalbumin. In the primary
structure of antithrombin, the 402-407 region is located between the P1 residue of the reactive centre and highly conserved regions in strands 4B and 5B of the "activation peptide." The crystal structure of intact ovalbumin (65) can serve
as a working prototype for the three dimensional structures of
native (reactive loop intact) serpins, Fig. 9. Antithrombin residues 402-407 map to strand IC and the polypeptide leading
into strand 4B. The positions of the reactive site, heparin-binding site, and conserved elements of the "activation peptide" are
marked in Fig. 9, and the functional consequences of the 402407 mutations will be considered in terms of this model.
In vitro studies of purified antithrombins Rosny and Torino (Fig. 5) and antithrombin Utah in plasma (31) revealed
defective interactions with thrombin. Based on their presence
in patients with clinical thrombosis, it is likely that the other
402-407 region variants also have abnormal interactions with
thrombin. The P1 residue of antithrombin, 393 Arg, is the
primary determinant of thrombin target specificity and interacts with the enzyme active site. However, because antithrombin inhibits thrombin more efficiently than several other serpins that also have arginine P1 residues (a2-antiplasmin, PAI1, PAI-2, C1 inhibitor, and protein C inhibitor), it can be
inferred that an extended inhibitor-enzyme contact surface
surrounding the P1 residue participates in the recognition and
inhibition of target enzymes by serpins. Inspection of Fig. 9
shows that the 402-407 region is in close proximity to the reactive loop containing the P1 residue, and may constitute part of
the extended contact surface or be very close to it. Thus, based
on their location near the P1 residue, mutations in the 402-407
region may block antithrombin-protease interactions directly
or indirectly.
Heparin binding abnormalities have been demonstrated in
seven 402-407 region variants by CIE of plasma (Fig. 1). Decreased heparin affinity was confirmed for antithrombins
Rosny and Torino by heparin-Sepharose chromatography
(Fig. 2 ), but not for antithrombin Utah ( 31 ). Elements of the
heparin-binding site are found on the lower face of the mole-

cule shown in Fig. 9. The heparin-binding site is distinct from
the reactive site and the region containing 402-407 (upper part
of the molecule shown), and spatially removed from them.
Therefore, barring overall denaturation ofthe variants, the presence of heparin binding abnormalities in these mutants suggests that the reactive site end of antithrombin (containing the
402-407 region) is linked conformationally to the heparinbinding site at the other side of the molecule. The converse of
this idea is the basis of conformation-based hypotheses to explain antithrombin heparin cofactor activity (3, 4). The 402407 substitutions map to strand IC and the polypeptide leading
into s4B, and constitute a significant part of the interface between the C sheet at the reactive site pole of the inhibitor, and
the internal B sheet which connects at its other end to alpha
helices, forming the heparin-binding site of antithrombin (Fig.
9 B). Thus, mutations in the 402-407 region may relay structural changes to the distal heparin binding site by perturbing
the B sheet and the core of the molecule. In the extreme, it is
possible that inducing perturbations in the core may disrupt
protein folding and lead to a phenomenon of general protein
denaturation, which would also be associated with a phenotype
of defective target enzyme and cofactor interactions and decreased plasma levels.
Decreased circulating concentrations of several 402-407
region variants have been detected by CIE (Fig. 1 ) and Western
blotting (31) and it had been suggested that integrity of this
region is necessary for obtaining normal circulating serpin levels (66, 67). Quantitative deficiencies of antithrombin 402407 variants could be caused by decreased synthesis, increased
intracellular degradation, impaired secretion, and/or increased turnover. Two highly conserved elements of the activation peptide map near to 402-407 in the tertiary structure and
are thought to play important roles in regulating serpin intracellular degradation and turnover. Brodbeck and Brown noted
that COOH-terminal frameshift mutations caused secretory
defects in naturally occurring a,-antitrypsin mutants and used
an in vitro mutagenesis approach to show that truncations before invariant proline-391 (marked with an asterisk in Fig. 9)
are associated with intracellular degradation and prevent movement of the protein from the endoplasmatic reticulum to the
Golgi apparatus (68). Thus, intracellular degradation and decreased secretion may occur for some of the antithrombin 402407 variants as a consequence of structural perturbations extending from the immediate vicinity of the substitutions to the
region of the invariant proline (residue 391 in a1-antitrypsin).
Alternatively, accelerated turnover may be the mechanism responsible for quantitative deficiencies of some 402-407 variants in which structural abnormalities caused by the substitu-

tions lead to exposure of a highly conserved neoepitope (Fig.
9), proposed to serve as a ligand for hepatic serpin-enzyme
complex receptors (67). It is notable that the quantitative deficiency phenotype of a,-antitrypsin Heerlen (69), which carries
a leucine for proline substitution at the residue (369) corresponding to antithrombin 407 (see Fig. 8), suggests that this
region of serpins is generally involved in determining circulating protein level.
In summary, the pleiotropic effects of antithrombin 402407 substitution mutants can be rationalized in terms of a
three-dimensional model derived from the crystal structure of
native ovalbumin. The strand IC region containing the 402407 mutations is contiguous with the reactive site and two
highly conserved elements of the activation peptide that may
play important roles in regulating serpin intracellular degradation and plasma clearance; this may explain defective interactions of slC mutants with thrombin, and their low circulating
levels. In contrast, slC is distal to the positively charged surface
which forms the heparin binding site of heparin; altered heparin-binding properties of the slC variants may therefore reflect
conformational linkage between the reactive site and heparinbinding regions of the molecule. Alternatively, integrity of the
402-407 region may be required for antithrombin to fold
correctly, and the pleiotropic effects of slC substitutions may
represent the consequences of general protein denaturation.
Finally, it is interesting that the antithrombin Budapest variant
(22) exhibits pleiotropic reactive site and heparin-binding site
defects, and carries a substitution (P429L) that maps near the
402-407 region in the tertiary structure (Fig. 9), but not the
primary structure.
