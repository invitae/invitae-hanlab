Summary. We describe a previously unreported glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase-(G6PD) variant. G6PD Viangchan
was found in a Laotian immigrant to Calgary, Canada, and
was characterized by severe enzyme deficiency, normal electrophoretic mobility, increased pH optimum, and abnormal
kinetics for the natural substrates G6PD and N A D P , as well
as the artificial substrates 2-deoxy G6PD and deamino NADP.
The inhibition constant for N A D P H was decreased. The subject has no evidence suggesting chronic or episodic hemolysis.

We have studied a severe G6PD-deficient variant in a young
boy whose family recently immigrated from Laos to Calgary,
Canada. The propositus is a 7-year-old Laotian immigrant
(from the city of Viangehan) who participated in an a-thalassemia study at the University of Calgary (Chiu et al. 1986) and
who was incidentally found to have G6PD deficiency. Unlike
the propositus, his mother, one brother, and one sister had
been found to have an et-thalassemia trait (genotype --/c~a).
He has been healthy with no abnormal physical findings, and
there was no history suggestive of chronic or acute hemolytic
episodes. His hemoglobin concentration was 12.1 g/dl; mean
red cell volume was 84.4 fi. His serum total bilirubin was normal (5 pmol/1, normal 3-20 gmol/l), and lactic dehydrogenase
was slightly increased (247units/i, normal 60-200units/1.
Hemoglobin electrophoresis and globin gene mapping studies
showed no abnormality in the propositus. His father and
brother did not have G6PD deficiency.

Biochemical and physical characteristics of G6PD were determined by methods described previously (Betke et al. 1967;
Beutler et al. 1968). N A D P H inhibitor studies were carried
out as described by Yoshida (1983). The enzymatic activity
was assayed in purified red cell hemolysate (Beutler et al.
1967) and expressed in international units (IU)/g of Hb.
The initial screening of the propositus revealed severe
G6PD deficiency. Evaluation of the kinetics of the partially
purified glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from the propositus revealed that it differs in many respect from other
G6PD variants with severely deficient G6PD activity found in
Southeast Asia, as well as any other reported G6PD variant
seen elsewhere. This new variant is designated G6PD Viangchan. The detailed kinetic characteristics of this mutant are
given in Table 1.
This is therefore a unique G6PD variant with severely deficient red cell enzymatic activity found in a nonanemic ethnic
Laotian immigrant who has no history of hemolysis. However,
the history was believed not to be reliable because of difficulties in communication with his recently immigrated parents.
Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that this variant may
produce susceptibility to acute intermittent hemolysis upon
exposure to oxidative stress. Since there is limited information
about G6PD variants in Laos, we cannot be certain whether
this is a sporadic mutation in this family or whether it is a
common polymorphic variant in Laos. However, in neighboring Thailand the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in different
Thai regions ranges from 3% to 15% of the population (Beutler et al. 1978). Unfortunately, only limited information is

variants in Thailand. Similar statements can be m a d e about
neighboring Viet Nam, although those Vietnamese and Thai
G 6 P D variants that have been fully characterized (Yoshida
1983; Beutler 1983; McKusick 1986) differ in many respects
from G 6 P D Viangchan. H o w e v e r , some Chinese G6PD-deficient variants are particularly c o m m o n in Southeast Asia
(Panich et al. 1980).
