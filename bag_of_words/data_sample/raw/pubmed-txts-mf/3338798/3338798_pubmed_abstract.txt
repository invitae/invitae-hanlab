We describe a previously unreported glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-(G6PD) variant. G6PD Viangchan was found in a Laotian immigrant to Calgary, Canada, and was characterized by severe enzyme deficiency, normal electrophoretic mobility, increased pH optimum, and abnormal kinetics for the natural substrates G6PD and NADP, as well as the artificial substrates 2-deoxy G6PD and deamino NADP. The inhibition constant for NADPH was decreased. The subject has no evidence suggesting chronic or episodic hemolysis.
