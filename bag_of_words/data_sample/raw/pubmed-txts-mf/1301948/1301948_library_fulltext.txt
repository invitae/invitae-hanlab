Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a dominantly inherited metabolic disease caused by a partial
deficiency of the third enzyme, porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), in the heme biosynthetic pathway. AIP has been divided into two subtypes according to the ratio of enzyme polypeptide concentration and enzyme activity measured in erythrocytes: cross-reacting immunologic material (CRIM)
positive or negative. I n this study six out of the seven known CRIM-positive AIP families in Finland
were analyzed and two also previously identified mutations in the PBGD gene were found to be
responsible for A I P in this genetically isolated population. T h e search for mutations was focused on
exon 10 based on previously found mutations. SSCP analysis revealed a known polymorphism but the
two mutations in that region were found only by direct sequencing of the PCR products. A G5I8
A substitution changing Arg’73 to Gln was found in three families and a C499
T substitution
changing Arg16’ to T r p was detected in three families. DNA analyses of the family members revealed
that conventional assays of erythrocyte PBGD activity identified correctly only 72% of the carriers for
the AIP mutation. o 1992 Wiley-Liss, h c .

INTRODUCTION

Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a dominantly inherited metabolic disease caused by a partial deficiency of the third enzyme in the heme
biosynthetic pathway (Kappas et al., 1989). The
mean activity of porphobilinogen deaminase
(PBGD) in patients’ erythrocytes is usually half of
the normal (Meyer et al., 1972).
Biochemical and immunological studies of
PBGD have suggested that AIP is caused by a heterogeneous group of mutations and AIP has been
divided into two subtypes according to the ratio of
enzyme polypeptide concentration and enzyme activity measured in erythrocytes: cross-reacting immunologic material (CRIM) negative or positive
(Anderson et al. 1981). CRIM-positive patients
are further divided into two groups (type 1 and 2)
according to the relative amount of the inactive
protein (Desnick et al., 1985, Table 1).
Although AIP is biochemically heterogeneous,
the clinical phenotype is relatively uniform and
characterized by occasional acute attacks of abdominal pain and various neuropsychiatric symptoms (Kappas et al., 1989). The cDNA and the
0 1992 WILEY-LISS, INC.

main parts of the PBGD gene have been characterized (Chretien et al., 1988; Grandchamp et al.,
1987; Lee, 1991; Namba et al., 1991; Raich et al.,
1986). There are two isoforms of PBGD, which
both are encoded by a single gene on chromosome
11 q24. The PBGD gene is about 10 kb in size and
contains 15 exons.
In different populations, 9-50% of the AIP patients have been CRIM positive (Lannfelt et al.,
1989; Mustajoki and Desnick, 1985; de Rooij et
al., 1987). We have biochemically characterized
all the adult AIP patients in Finland (Mustajoki
and Koskelo, 1976; Mustajoki and Desnick, 1985).
Twenty-eight (19%) of 145 Finnish AIP patients
have been CRIM positive. They originate from
seven families and here we report mutations of the
PBGD gene in six of them originating from the
genetically isolated population of Finland.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

A total of 35 members of the seven CRIM-positive Finnish families were analyzed including six
patients from four type 1 families and 15 patients
from three type 2 families who demonstrated the
low erythrocyte PBGD activity. Families were not
related according to extended pedigree analyses
and 14 family members had shown normal or uncertain results in assays of erythrocyte PBGD activity. The diagnosis of AIP was based on increased
excretion of porphobilinogen in the urine (Mauzerall and Granick, 1956) or on the low PBGD
activity (Ford et al., 1980).
DNA and RNA Extractions

DNA was extracted from white blood cells and

RNA was extracted from Epstein-Barr virus transfected lymphoblastoid cell lines as described earlier
(Chirwing et al., 1975; Sambrook et al., 1989).

described above except n o radiolabeled nucleotides
were used. The PCR products were purified from
1% agarose gel as described earlier (Bewsey et al.,
1991) or using Magic PCR Prep Kit (Promega,
USA). The products were sequenced using the
dideoxynucleotide chain termination method
(Sanger et al., 1977).
RESULTS

The DNA samples of the patients representing
two CRIM-positive rypes of AIP (Table 1) were
analyzed with SSCP technique. The mutation
search was focused on the region of exon 10 in the
PBGD gene, since the mutations reported earlier
among CRIM-positive patients have been localized
on this region (Delfau et al., 1990). SSCP analysis
and direct sequencing of the PCR products from
the genomic DNA of the patients demonstrated a
known G/T polymorphism (Gu et al., 1991a) in
exon 10 (Figs. 1,2), but n o additional mobility

SSCP Analyses
For the SSCP analyses (Orita et al., 1989), 240
bp of the genomic DNA were amplified (Mullis
and Faloona, 1987) containing complete exon 10.
The DNA (200 ng per sample) was amplified with
intron primers, 50 pmol each (sense:TGGTCCTTAGCAACTCTCCACAG, anti-sense:GAAAGGAAGATGCGATGAGCTGG) in 50 p1 of a
solution. The samples were radiolabeled during
PCR by adding 5 p C i of [ol-32P]dCTP(Amersham;
UK 1 C i = 3 7 GBq) into reaction tube. Singlestrand separation gel electrophoresis was run at
room temperature as described earlier (Hata et al.,
1990).
Sequencing of the cDNA and the Genomic DNA

Total RNA (1-2 pg) was used to synthesize
cDNA by reverse transcription from a PBGD specific primer of the noncoding region of cDNA
(CTGTGCCCCACAAACCAG) . Of the genomic DNA or cDNA 240 bp was amplified as

analysis of exon 10 of the PBGD gene in the
DNA samples of the AIP patients. (1) A CRIM-negative patient, (2) a healthy control, (3) undenaturated sample of a

shifts were observed in the amplified samples of
this region.
In three CRIM positive type 1 families a G518
+ A substitution changing Arg‘73 to Gln (Delfau
et al., 1990) was found by direct sequencing of the
amplified products of patients’ genomic DNA. The
nucleotide change was confirmed by direct sequencing of the PCR product from the total cDNA
of one patient. In one of the type 1 families neither
G518 + A nor a previously reported G5Oo + A
(Delfau et al., 1990) mutation was found.
In three CRIM-positive type 2 families a C499
+ T substitution at the first base of exon 10 (Figs.
2,3) changing Arg’67 to Trp was revealed by direct
sequencing of the amplified products of patients’
genomic DNA. This change was again confirmed
by direct sequencing of the amplified cDNA synthesized from total RNA of a patient’s lymphoblast
line. This mutation was not found in the samples
of CRIM-positive type 1 patients, unrelated CRIM
negative patients (n= 20) or unrelated healthy
controls (n= 20) To compare the DNA analysis to the conventional methods used in the diagnostics of AIP, 26
members of the CRIM-positive type 2 families
were analyzed by direct sequencing of the PCR
products of the genomic DNA. A total of 11 family
members having the C499+ T mutation were detected. Earlier biochemical analyses had demonstrated the low erythrocyte PBGD activity in four
family members who had been classified as affected, but they were not found to be carriers of the
AIP mutation. The excretions of porphobilinogen
and 6-aminolevulinic acid in the urine were also
normal. Further, in the DNA samples of two fam-

ily members whose enzyme activity were within
the normal range, this C499+ T mutation could
be detected and in the case of one subject whose
earlier biochemical analysis had been inconclusive, the diagnosis of AIP could be established.
DISCUSSION
Recently several specific mutations of PBGD
have been demonstrated to be responsible for AIP
(Nordmann et al., 1990). Among CRIM-negative
patients each mutation has been almost family specific. In CRIM-positive patients some mutations
seem to be more frequent, three different mutations have been reported in 7 families analyzed
(Delfau et al., 1990; Grandchamp et al., 1989).
Exon 10 has been postulated to be “hot spot” of
mutations (Lee, 1991; Nordmann et al., 1990) and
in CRIM-positive patients most mutations are really in this exon. In the isolated population of
Finland two mutations were found to be responsible for the disease in six out of the seven known
CRIM-positive families.
Two different mutations in type 1 CRIM-positive patients have been described earlier (Delfau et
al., 1990; Grandchamp et al., 1989). In four
French or Dutch families a G518--+ A substitution
in exon 10 has been detected (Delfau et al., 1990).
In our study three of the four type 1 families carried
the same G518-+ A mutation. Moreover, a point
mutation G + A in exon 12 causing exon 12
skipping has been found in a French CRIM-positive patient (CRIM ratio measured only in lymphoblasts, Grandchamp et al., 1989), but no data
exist concerning the frequence of this mutation in
other populations.

patient’s amplified genomic DNA showing the mutation C -+ T site.

All Finnish CRIM-positive type 2 patients had
the same C499+ T mutation. This mutation has
previously been mentioned in a n abstract (Gu et
al., 1991b) which, however, does not give any
further information about it. This type of CRIM
positive mutation with excessive accumulation of
inactive, non catalytic protein has also been reported from two AIP families with a G5Oo -+ A
substitution in the same codon (Delfau et al.,
1990). In Swedish porphyric patients at least the
~ 5 0 0
+ A substitution has been found in one family (Lee, 1991). None of the Finnish CRIM-positive families was of this type.
Assays of the PBGD activity in erythrocytes are
known to detect about 70-80% of possible carriers
for AIP (Bottomley et al., 1981). In agreement
with these values, in one of our CRIM-positive
type 2 families, 72% of the patients could be identified correctly by measuring the enzyme activity in
erythrocytes and only the verification of the mutation at the DNA level provided the correct diagnosis. In AIP, early and certain diagnosis is essential. As is demonstrated here also biochemical
tests have their limitations in diagnostics of AIP,
and some family members remain undiagnosed or
carry uncertain diagnosis of AIP. The identification of the mutations at the DNA level is a convenient and the only reliable way to screen carriers
of the affected gene already at youth facilitating
correct treatment and proper genetic counselling
of family members at risk.
