Molecular analysis of aldolase B genes in hereditary
fructose intolerance

molecular basis of hereditary fructose
intolerance (HFI) was studied in 50 subjects (41
pedigrees, 82 apparently independent mutant
alleles of aldolase B) by direct analysis of aldolase
B genes amplified by means of the polymerase
chain reaction. The mutation A149P (ala 149&rarr; pro)
was found in 67% of alleles but was significantly
more common in patients from northern than from
southern Europe. Two other point mutations of
aldolase B were identified. A174D (C&rarr;A; ala 174&rarr;
asp) was found in subjects from Italy, Switzerland,
and Yugoslavia (overall frequency 16%) but not in
those from the United Kingdom, France, or the
United States. L288&Dgr;C carried a single base-pair
deletion causing frameshift at codon 288 and was
restricted to Sicilian subjects. By testing for these
mutations in amplified DNA with a limited panel of
allele-specific oligonucleotides, more than 95% of
HFI patients will be susceptible to genetic
diagnosis.

The

Introduction
fructose intolerance (HFI) is an autosomal
recessive disease that results from a deficiency of aldolase B
(fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, EC 4.1.2.13) in the liver,
kidney, and intestine; this enzyme brings about the
assimilation of fructose by means of cleavage of fructose-1phosphate to trioses.1-3 Affected people suffer from
abdominal pain, vomiting, and hypoglycaemia after
ingestion of fructose or related sugars and are most at risk
from severe metabolic disturbance as infants at weaning.
Nonetheless, episodic hypoglycaemia, liver disease, renal
tubular acidosis, and growth retardation follow exposure to
fructose in later life, occasionally with fatal results.3-6 The

Hereditary

disorder is treated by strict dietary exclusion of fructose,
sorbitol, and sucrose, and the response is usually complete.
In undiagnosed patients a strong aversion to sweet-tasting
foods develops, with a consequent reduction of fructose
intake, but in the absence of professional advice, complete
elimination of this sugar from the diet is difficult, and such
people may suffer symptoms throughout life.1,3,6 Prompt
recognition of the disease is therefore important for its
effective management. The diagnosis of HFI is confirmed
by the intravenous fructose tolerance test or by direct assay
of fructaldolase activities in tissue biopsy samples.’ These
procedures are invasive and are especially difficult in infants
and young children. Detection of disease carriers poses
particular difficulties, and although heterozygotes have been
identified by enzymic assay of intestinal mucosa8 and by
phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy after
fructose loading,9 until now no simple and direct procedure
has been available.
We have described the isolation and characterisation of a
defective aldolase B gene from a patient with HFI/" We
identified a single base-pair change which results in the
replacement of an alanine residue at position 149 by a proline

residue. This mutation (A149P), was found in several
apparently unrelated patients in the United Kingdom." We
report here the distribution of the A149P mutation in
Europe and the United States. Furthermore, we have
characterised two new genetic lesions in HFI and have
examined their distribution.

Subjects and methods
50 patients with HFI, from 41 independent families, were studied.
The patients were from the UK, France, Switzerland, Italy,
Yugoslavia, and the USA. HFI was diagnosed on the basis of
clinical history and the intravenous fructose tolerance test; in some
cases it was confirmed by assay of fructaldolase activities in tissue
biopsy samples? 3 UK patients were considered to be affected on
the basis of a typical history of dietary intolerance with episodes
suggestive of hypoglycaemia. There were 2 sisters, aged 3 and 7
years, who were found to be homozygous for the A149P mutation,
and a 54-year-old woman with life-long symptoms of fructose
intolerance, who also carried the A149P allele. DNA was prepared
from peripheral blood leucocytes12 or from crude lysates of buccal
epithelial cells obtained from saline mouthwashes.13
95% confidence limits (CL) of allele frequencies in population
samples were derived from exact values of the binomial distribution
by entering the observed allele frequencies in different samples.14
The significance of differences in the proportion of alleles between
TABLE III-GENOTYPES OF PROBANDS

the sample groups was determined by the four-fold contingency
test.14
The polymerase chain reaction15 (PCR) was used to amplify
DNA in a home-made thermocycling apparatus with Taq
polymerase (Perkin Elmer Cetus). 16 To optimise specificity, the
annealing temperature was varied between 45&deg;C and 55&deg;C and the
magnesium (Mg2+) concentration between 1-0 mmol/1 and 1-5
mmol/1. Blank (no DNA) controls were routinely run in parallel to
ensure that the reaction components were free of contaminating
aldolase B sequences. Primers used for amplication of aldolase B
exons were derived from the genomic sequence17 as shown in table 1.
Each fragment contained the entire coding sequence of that exon,
plus splice junctions and lariat branch points.
Amplified exons were sequenced either directly after production
of single-stranded DNA by PCR with unequal primer
concentrations18 or by cloning fragments into the Small site of
pEMBL19. Reactions were carried out by the chain terminator
method with ’Sequenase’ (USB) according to the manufacturer’s

recommendations.
For genotype analysis, exons 5 and 8 were amplified by PCR and
about 100 ng of the product was immobilised on nylon membranes
(’Hybond N’, Amersham) by either dot blotting or Southern
blotting after electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels. Spots of
wild-type and mutant plasmids were included to serve as
hybridisation controls. Filters were prehybridised in 6 x SSC
(SSC=0-015 mol/1 sodium citrate, 0-15 mol/1 sodium chloride),
5 x Denhardt’s solution (5 x = Ficoll 0-1%, polyvinylpyrrolidone
0-1%, bovine serum albumin 0&deg; 1 %), 100 jig/ml sonicated salmon
sperm DNA, for 2 h at 65&deg;C, then hybridised overnight at 37&deg;C by
the addition of 100 ng y-phosphorus-32 end-labelled
oligonucleotide probe (about 10g cpm/g) to the prehybridisation
solution. Blots were washed three times in 6 x SSC, 0-01 % sodium
dodecyl sulphate at room temperature and exposed to film for 30-60
min. This low-stringency wash served as a control for the amount of
target DNA generated in the PCR and to ensure that the probe had
hybridised efficiently. Two high-stringency washes were carried
out at the appropriate discriminatory temperature for 2 min in
6 x SSC, 0-01% sodium dodecyl sulphate. Allele-specific
oligonucleotides and discriminatory temperatures are given in table
n. Filters were stripped of probe by heating to 80&deg;C in 0-01%
sodium dodecyl sulphate before hybridisation with another

oligonucleotide.

Results
Exon 5 was amplified from each subject’s DNA and probed
with A149P and A149wt (wild-type) oligonucleotides. After
washing at high stringency, hybridisation to the A149P
probe only showed that the subject was homozygous for this
mutation. Hybridisation to both probes indicated an A149P
compound heterozygote in which the wild-type signal
originated from a different mutant allele. A signal with only
the wild-type probe indicated that the subject did not carry
A149P on either of his or her defective aldolase B genes.

A149P was prevalent in all the countries studied; the allele

77-%) overall. There seemed to be a north-south gradient
in the frequency of the mutation-A149P was significantly
more prevalent in the UK than in Italy (table III; p < 0-05).
Of the 41 independent pedigrees, 20 probands (49%) were
homozygous for A149P and 14 (34%) were compound
heterozygotes with A149P on one of the mutant alleles.
Of the 50 patients studied, 7 did not carry the A149P
mutation on either mutant allele. 2 such patients, both from
Sicily, were selected for further study. Exons 2-9, which
include the complete coding region for aldolase B, were
amplified and sequenced. A single point mutation was
identified in each; no other lesions were found. The first
patient carried a transition, C-A, in exon 5 which results in
the replacement of the invariant alanine residue (GCC) at
position 174 of the normal protein by an aspartic acid residue
(GAC). The mutation was therefore termed A174D. The
second patient carried a single base-pair deletion. The C
residue of the codon for leucine at position 288 in exon 8 was
absent; this allele was designated L288AC. This frameshift
mutation creates a stop codon at position 297, so a protein
truncated by 67 residues would be produced (fig 1). These
lesions neither generate nor destroy restriction sites, and
to
detect them in genomic DNA, allele-specific
oligonucleotide probes were synthesised for their respective
wild-type and mutant sequences. Hybridisation of these
probes to amplified exon 5 and exon 8 sequences showed
that these 2 patients were homozygous for their respective
mutations, despite the fact that neither was apparently the
product of a consanguineous marriage.

Fig 2-Genotype analysis of representative HFI patients.
Patients 1, 2, 6, and 8 were homozygous for Al 49 P; patient 3 was
homozygous for A174D; patients 4, 5, and 10 had genotypes A149P/
A174D; patient 7 A149P/unknown; patient 9 both alleles unknown.

The A174D mutation occurs in exon 5; the filters
prepared for the analysis of A149P were stripped and
reprobed with A174D and A174wt allele-specific oligonucleotides. The genotype analysis of representative HFI
patients is shown in fig 2. We found Al 74D in several of our
patients from Switzerland, Italy, and Yugoslavia but not in
those from the UK, France, or the USA. The frequency of
independent A174D alleles was 15-9% (13/82; 95% CL
8-7%-25-6%) overall-30% (8 of 27) in Switzerland and
22% (4 of 18) in Italy. This mutation also accounted for one
allele of the single Yugoslavian patient. In all, 2 of the 41
patients were A174D homozygotes and 9 were A174D
compound heterozygotes, of which 7 were A149P/A174D.
Of the 82 independent alleles studied, 68 (83%) were
either A149P or A174D. Patients with as yet
uncharacterised lesions were tested for the L288AC and
L288wt oligonucleotides. Only 2 subjects, both originating
from Sicily, were positive for this deletion. The first was
homozygous, and the second was an A149P/L288AC
compound heterozygote. These subjects were not known to
be related.

Discussion
We have previously described the identification of the
A149P point mutation and speculated that this substitution
would disrupt the spatial configuration of important
residues (Lys 146 and Arg 148) on the 0 strand of the
aldolase B substrate-binding pocket.10 We have now
characterised two more mutant aldolase B alleles and used
the PCR and allele-specific oligonucleotide probes to detect
these lesions in genomic DNA.
The first lesion is another mis-sense mutation (C-A)
that results in the replacement of the normal alanine residue
at position 174 by an aspartic acid residue (A174D). The
alanine 174 residue is conserved in all the aldolase isozymes
studied so far, including those of vertebrates, maize, and
Drosophila.19 Furthermore, in the crystal structure of rabbit
aldolase A 20 Ala 174 is found in an It.-helical region that is
juxtaposed to the substrate-binding residues described
above. The Al 74D substitution results in a change of charge
that is likely to affect vicinal residues in this important
region. Both A149P and A174D are located on exon 5 of
human aldolase B and may thus be conveniently detected by
probing the same filter with their respective mutant and
wild-type oligonucleotides. The second lesion is a frameshift
mutation caused by the deletion of a single C residue at Leu
288. The change predicts a mutant protein that is shortened
by 67 aminoacids and therefore lacks several conserved
regions, including the carboxy-terminus, which is
important for normal activity. 21
A149P was found in patients from throughout western
Europe and also in patients from the USA, though there
seemed to be a north-south gradient in its frequency in
Europe. In this study, A174D was restricted to patients
from Switzerland, Italy, and Yugoslavia.
The frameshift mutation L288AC was found only in 2
Sicilian patients (3 of 10 HFI alleles from that island).
Although these 2 subjects were apparently unrelated and
came from different regions of Sicily, it remains possible
that this lesion is confined to 1 extensive family. To ascertain
whether L288AC is prevalent in Sicily and Sicilian-derived
populations, it would be necessary to analyse a larger sample
of patients from the region.
At the end of this study, 11 of 82 (134%; 95% CL

6-9-22-7%)

mutant

alleles

were

unaccounted

for.

309

Preliminary studies of 4 of these show that each carries a
different deletion, ranging in size from 4 bp to 1-6 kilobases
(unpublished). It is possible that the 7 remaining
uncharacterised alleles also represent private mutations and
that the frequency of this category reflects the rate of new
mutation at the human aldolase B locus.
Infants at weaning who suffer from HFI show signs of
food rejection and failure to thrive. It is at this age that
affected patients would benefit most from definitive
diagnosis so that rigorous dietary treatment could be
instituted. Most patients acquire a strong distaste for
sweet-tasting foods, but many suffer episodically
throughout life as a result of inadvertent ingestion of noxious
foods and drinkS.l,3,8,11 Existing methods of diagnosis
(intravenous fructose tolerance test and tissue biopsy Y are
invasive. We predict that the great majority of individuals
may be diagnosed by direct testing for the presence of
prevalent mutant aldolase B alleles. Such testing can
conveniently be carried out on DNA extracted from small
samples of blood or from buccal epithelial cells derived from
saline mouthwashes.1u3
We have identified two common HFI alleles and a third
which may be an important cause of the disease in Sicily.
A149P and A174D both occur in exon 5 and thus may be
sought after a single PCR amplification. We envisage that
this search may eventually be achieved by use of amplified
exon 5 sequences to probe four immobilised allele-specific
oligonucleotides, so constructed that their discriminating
temperatures for hybridisation are identical. This method of
analysis has been successfully applied to the diagnosis of

&bgr;-thalassaemia.22
In our sample of

82 independent alleles, 71 (86-7%; 95%
CL 77 3-93 1 %) were accounted for by the three mutations
described above. At the lower limit, therefore, we would
expect 60% of HFI patients (0-7732 x 100) to carry at least
one of these lesions on both alleles, 35% to be compound
heterozygotes of one common allele and an unknown
mutation, and only 5% to possess two undefined mutant
alleles. In practice, we found that of the 41 probands
examined, 31 (76%) could be genotypically defined, 8
(19-5%) could be defined for one allele only, 2 (5%) carried
unknown aldolase B lesions.
It has been estimated23 that the frequency of HFI may be
as high as 1 in 20 000 live births. The corresponding
frequency of carriers in the population would be approximately 1 in 70. We consider the finding of a single mutant
allele in an individual giving a typical nutritional history or
suffering from symptoms of HFI to be highly suggestive of
the disorder, since the probability that the patient is a simple
heterozygote for HFI, with symptoms due to an unrelated
cause, would be less than 2%. Thus, at the lowest
confidence limit of allele frequencies, the probability of
diagnosing fructose intolerance by direct detection of the
molecular lesions described here is greater than 95%.
We thank the many patients and their families who took part in this study and

danger

It is long since the first protest was directed against the dangerous
and untidy, but very common, practice of throwing down fruit skins
at random in the public way. Yet, as if road and pavement, coated by
the frosts of winter, were not slippery enough, we still see freely
distributed upon them those treacherous fragments of orange-peel,
apple-parings, and the like, which experience and precaution have
condemned as the frequent causes of accident. Familiar as the evil is,
its effectual correction is by no means a simple matter. Advice in
abundance has been applied in vain. Carelessness will not be thus
instructed, and the difficulty is not the less that the offender is often
a child. Still, the matter is not hopelessly beyond a chance of
amendment.... We think it reasonable that every householder
should clear the snow from the approach to his dwelling. Is it out of
the question that consumers of fruit be likewise required, on pain of
a moderate fine, to refrain from littering the streets with dangerous
waste?
