Abstract
Two isozymes of steroid 5a-reductase encoded by separate loci
catalyze the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone.
Inherited defects in the type 2 isozyme lead to male pseudohermaphroditism in which affected males have a normal internal
urogenital tract but external genitalia resembling those of a
female. The 5a-reductase type 2 gene (gene symbol SRD5A2)
was cloned and shown to contain five exons and four introns.
The gene was localized to chromosome 2 band p23 by somatic
cell hybrid mapping and chromosomal in situ hybridization.
Molecular analysis of the SRD5A2 gene resulted in the identification of 18 mutations in 11 homozygotes, 6 compound heterozygotes, and 4 inferred compound heterozygotes from 23 families with 5a-reductase deficiency. 6 apparent recurrent mutations were detected in 19 different ethnic backgrounds. In two
patients, the catalytic efficiency of the mutant enzymes correlated with the severity of the disease. The high proportion of
compound heterozygotes suggests that the carrier frequency of
mutations in the 5a-reductase type 2 gene may be higher than
previously thought. (J. Clin. Invest. 1992. 799-809.) Key

Introduction
The establishment of male phenotypic sex in man is a complex
process mediated by two types of hormones from the fetal
testes. The peptide hormone mullerian inhibiting substance is
responsible for regression of the mullerian ducts, and steroidal
androgens mediate development of the male urogenital tract
and of the male external genitalia (reviewed in 1, 2).
The androgen-dependent development of male genitalia
can be further divided into events requiring testosterone and
those requiring dihydrotestosterone (2). Testosterone induces
the virilization of the Wolffian ducts into the seminal vesicles,
vasa deferentia, and epididymides, and also serves as the pro-

hormone for the synthesis of dihydrotestosterone in a reaction
catalyzed by membrane-bound steroid 5c-reductase (5a-reductase) enzymes (2, 3). Dihydrotestosterone in turn induces
the formation of the external genitalia, urethra, and prostate
(2). Although they mediate separate embryonic developmental programs, the two steroids act through the same androgen
receptor protein (4).
The two-androgen model of male phenotypic sexual differentiation was initially formulated on the basis of studies of
dihydrotestosterone formation in the anlage of the external
genitalia (5). This hypothesis received strong support from the
study of an autosomal recessive disorder (5a-reductase deficiency) that results from impairment of the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (6, 7). The disorder is caused
by mutations in a 5a-reductase enzyme with an acidic pH optimum (8). At birth, affected males usually exhibit genital ambiguity characterized by normal Wolffian duct derivatives but
abnormal external genitalia and a rudimentary prostate (4).
The external genitalia in affected subjects exhibit phenotypic
variation and can range from almost normal female structures
(pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias), the usual finding
(4, 6, 7, 9), to a clear cut male phenotype with hypospadias
( 10 ). The genetic basis for this heterogeneity is not known, but
biochemical analyses of fibroblasts and tissues from patients
have revealed several different classes of mutations that affect
5a-reductase activity (4).
Complementary cDNAs have been isolated for two human
5ca-reductase isozymes (designated types 1 and 2) with distinct
biochemical, genetic, and pharmacological properties ( 1 1, 12).
Genetic analyses excluded the type 1 locus as the responsible
gene in eight unrelated families with the disorder ( 13), and a
deletion in the type 2 gene was found in affected subjects from
a small tribe in New Guinea ( 12 ).
Here, we analyze the molecular genetics and biochemistry
of 5a-reductase deficiency in a cohort of subjects from 25 families from various parts of the world. The results demonstrate
that mutations in the type 2 gene account for this disorder, and
they confirm the previously observed genetic heterogeneity.
Over 40% of the affected individuals were compound heterozygotes, suggesting that the carrier frequency of 5a-reductase 2
mutations in the population may be higher than previously
thought. Biochemical analysis of two substitution mutations
revealed determinants of both testosterone substrate and
NADPH cofactor binding, as well as insight into the unusual in
vitro acidic pH optimum characteristic of the type 2 isozyme.

Methods
Subjects. As indicated in Table I, 14 ofthe subjects have been described
in the literature (6, 7, 9, 10, 12-24). The diagnosis of 5a-reductase

deficiency was established in the other individuals by physical examination, measurements of ratios of plasma testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, pedigree analysis, studies of 5a-reductase in cultured skin fibroblasts, and karyotype.
5R2-Sao Paulo-l was a 17-yr-old 46, XY individual with microphallus, perineoscrotal hypospadias, a vaginal pouch, and bilateral
cryptorchidism. His parents were first cousins once removed; no other
members of the family are affected. He was raised as a female until age
15 when he began to virilize and changed gender role to male. No
breast tissue was palpable. Plasma testosterone was 386 ng/dl, and
plasma dihydrotestosterone was 4 ng/dl.
5R2-Sao Paulo-2 was raised as a female until age 3 and then assigned male gender. When assessed at age 6 he had microphallus, perineoscrotal hypospadias, a vaginal pouch, and testes palpable in the inguinal canals bilaterally. His parents are first cousins, and a brother and
three other relatives are similarly affected. After an hCG stimulation
test, the plasma testosterone was 292 ng/dl and dihydrotestosterone
was 6.6 ng/dl.
5R2-Pakistan, a patient of Dr. J. J. Van Wyk of The University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, was born in Pakistan and was evaluated in infancy because of microphallus, perineoscrotal hypospadias,
and left cryptorchidism. He was raised as a male. The parents are first
cousins; no other family members are affected. The karyotype was
46,XY with a t( 1 1;20) (q21;pl 1.2) balanced translocation. At age 19
plasma testosterone was 603 ng/dl, and dihydrotestosterone was 17
ng/dl.
5R2-Chicago-3, a patient of Dr. Paul Wong of Presbyterian-St.
Luke's Hospital, Chicago, was born in Pakistan and raised as a male.
When examined in Chicago at age 9.5 he had microphallus (3 cm) with
perineoscrotal hypospadias and testes palpable in the groin. The karyotype was 46,XY. There was no known consanguinity, but one sibling
had an identical phenotype. After administration of hCG plasma testosterone was 227 ng/dl and dihydrotestosterone was 8 ng/dl.
5R2-Sao Paulo-3 was raised as a female but changed gender role
behavior to male at age 30. When evaluated at age 31 he had microphallus, perineoscrotal hypospadias, a vaginal pouch, and right sided
cryptorchidism. No gynecomastia was present. His parents are first
cousins, and he has two affected siblings. Plasma testosterone was 575
ng/dl, and plasma dihydrotestosterone was 10 ng/dl.
5R2-Sao Paulo-4 was also raised as a female and changed gender
role behavior to male at age 14. When evaluated at age 29, he had
microphallus with perineoscrotal hypospadias, a vaginal pouch, and
testes in the inguinal canals. There is no consanguinity, but two siblings
are affected. Plasma testosterone was 666 ng/dl, and plasma dihydrotestosterone was 24 ng/dl.
5R2-Irvine, a patient of Dr. Ann K. Kershnar of the Children's
Hospital, Orange, CA, was raised as a female and evaluated at age 17
because of the development of clitoromegaly. There was no consanguinity, and the family history was uninformative. The karyotype was
46,XY, and bilateral testes and epididymis were identified at exploratory laparotomy.
5R2-Chicago-2, a patient of Dr. Robert L. Rosenfeld, University of
Chicago, Chicago, IL, was evaluated as a newborn because of ambiguous genitalia, namely, microphallus with a perineal urethra and a chordee, no vaginal pouch, and testes palpable in the labia. There was no
consanguinity, and the family history was uninformative. An hCG
stimulation test was done at 42 mo of age; plasma testosterone was 717
ng/dl, and plasma dihydrotestosterone was 19 ng/dl. The decision was
made to raise the subject as a female, and the testes were removed.
5R2-New York-2, a patient of Dr. Deborah Vine, Mount Sinai
School of Medicine, New York, was born in Jordan and reared as a
female but was told at an early age that she was a genetic male. At age
28, she was evaluated in New York and found to have a 3-cm phallus
with pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias, unfused labia, a blind
ending vaginal pouch, and one testes was palpable in the left labia
majora and the other was palpable in the right inguinal canal. The
karyotype was 46,XY, and the diagnosis was established by measuring
800

Thigpen et al.

ratios of urinary 5a to 5f# androgenic and other steroid metabolites in
urine (20).
5R2-New York-3 was identified at birth and raised as a female. At
age 5, during inguinal exploration for a hernia, a left testes was found
with epididymus and a spermatic cord. No uterus or fallopian tubes
were found. At age 13.5, she was placed on estrogen replacement therapy with good breast development. She had anxiety about her sexual
identity and other psychological problems throughout adolescence and
into adulthood. On physical examination at age 27, she had a 2.5-cm
clitoral-like phallus, a female urethra, a blind-ending vaginal pouch,
and slight posterior fusion of the labia. The ratio of etiocholanolone to
androsterone in urine was 3.4 (normal 0.93Â±0.37).
5R2-Los Angeles-3, a 13-yr-old girl, was evaluated by Dr. Barbara
Lippe, University of California, Los Angeles, for failure to feminize
and development of clitoromegaly and a deepened voice. On physical
examination, she had a female introitus and a shallow vagina, and
testes were palpable bilaterally in the groin. The parents are first
cousins once removed, but the family history was otherwise unremarkable. The karyotype was 46,XY. Plasma testosterone was 810 ng/dl
and plasma dihydrotestosterone was 35 ng/dl. The decision was made
to continue to raise her as a female, and the testes were removed. The
epididymis and vas deferens were male in character.
Measurement of5a-reductase activity in cultured skin fibroblasts.
5a-reductase activity was measured at pH 5.5 in extracts of fibroblasts
cultured from genital skin (labia majora, foreskin, scrotum) as before
(23). In 14 subjects, the activity was undetectable (0.2 pmol/h per mg
protein or less). In five instances (5R2-Pakistan, 5R2-Austria, 5R2New York-l, 5R2-London-2, and 5R2-Los Angeles-l) activity was
measurable but was shown to be qualitatively abnormal on the basis of
studies of enzyme stability and assessment of apparent Kms for
NADPH and/ortestosterone (4). In one case, (5R2-New Haven) activity measured at different times in the same fibroblast strain was highly
variable, but the diagnosis was established on endocrine and phenotypic grounds (10).
Isolation of5a-reductase 2 gene. Bacteriophage X clones harboring
inserts corresponding to the 5a-reductase 2 gene were isolated by high
stringency hybridization screening (25) using 32P-radiolabeled probes
(26) spanning the full length cDNA (12). Hybridization-positive
plaques were purified through multiple rounds of screening. Bacteriophage DNA was prepared from plate lysates (27), and human genomic
DNA inserts were released by digestion with the restriction enzyme
SalI before cloning into plasmid vectors (pBluescript, Stratagene Inc.,
La Jolla, CA). The intron-exon structure of the gene was determined
by restriction enzyme mapping, Southern blotting, and DNA sequence
analysis using oligonucleotide primers derived from the cDNA sequence ( 12).
Genomic DNA isolation. Fibroblasts biopsied from affected or normal individuals were grown to confluency in 15-cm dishes before genomic DNA isolation. White blood cells were obtained from blood withdrawn in the presence of EDTA. Total cellular DNA was isolated with
nucleic acid extractor (model 340A; Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster
City, CA) and stored in a buffer containing 10mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and
1 mM EDTA. DNA concentration was determined by fluorimetry using bisbenzimide.
Polymerase chain reactions. Individual exons of the 5a-reductase 2
gene were amplified via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)' using
thermostable DNA polymerases (28). The locations and names of the
exon-specific pairs of oligonucleotides are described in Fig. 1 and Table
II. Exon DNA to be analyzed for the presence of single strand conformation-dependent DNA polymorphisms (SSCPs) was amplified in a
20-1l reaction containing 0.1 ,ug genomic DNA, 1.75 AM each oligonucleotide primer, 50 ,uM each of the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates,
1.5% (vol/vol) glycerol, 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-Cl,
1. Abbreviations used in this paper: PCR, polymerase chain reaction;
SSCP, single strand conformation-dependent DNA polymorphism.

pH 8.3 (at 22Â°C), 10 ,tCi [a-32P]dCTP, and 3 U ofthermostable DNA
polymerase. All exons were amplified using a thermocycler program of
35 cycles of 1 min/94Â°C, 1 min/68Â°C, and a final cycle of 1 min/
94Â°C, 3 min/68Â°C.
Exon DNA to be sequenced was amplified in a 50-Al reaction containing 1.2 ,ug genomic DNA, 20 AM each oligonucleotide primer, 100
AM each of the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 1.5% (vol/vol)
glycerol, 50 mM KCI, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, and 3 U of
thermostable polymerase. Thermocycler conditions were those described above. The amount of amplified DNA product in a given reaction was estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis.
SSCP Analysis. Conformation-dependent DNA polymorphisms
were scored for by modifications of the procedures of Orita et al. (29,
30). Neutral polyacrylamide gels containing 5.4% (wt/vol) acrylamide-bisacrylamide (29:1), 90 mM Tris-borate, pH 8.3, 4 mM EDTA,
0.05% (wt/vol) NH4SO4, and 0.0 1% (vol/vol) N,N,N,N'-tetramethylethylenediamine were used to separate DNA conformers. Glycerol was
included at 10% (vol/vol) in some gels. Exon DNA (4.5 ,ul) amplified
and radiolabeled as described above was diluted into 25 Ml of 0.1%
(wt/vol) SDS, 10 mM EDTA. 2 ,ul of the diluted DNA was then added
to 2 M1 of formamide loading buffer (95% formamide (vol/vol), 50
mM EDTA, 0.05% (wt/vol) each of xylene cyanol and bromophenol
blue), incubated at 1 00Â°C for 6 min, and then quick cooled on ice. 1 ,l
of this sample was electrophoresed at 250 V for 14 h at 22Â°C (plus
glycerol gels) or 4Â°C (minus glycerol gels). A nondenatured sample
consisting of 0. 14 Ml of the original amplification reaction diluted into 2
Ml of sucrose buffer (60% sucrose [wt/voll, 50 mM EDTA, 0.05%
[wt/vol] each of xylene cyanol and bromophenol blue) was loaded in
an adjacent lane to determine the position of migration of the doublestranded exon DNA fragment.
Polymerase chain reaction sequencing. Exon DNA amplified in the
absence of radiolabeled deoxynucleoside triphosphates was purified on
Centricon- 100 columns (Amicon Corp., Danvers, MA) using a protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Aliquots corresponding to 3-10% of
the purified DNA were subjected to PCR sequencing (31 ) in the presence of dideoxynucleoside triphosphates using 32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide primers corresponding to those used to originally amplify
the DNA. A thermocycler program consisting of 20 cycles of 30
s/95Â°C, 30s/55Â°C, 30s/70Â°C,followedby 10cyclesofl min/95Â°C, 1
min/ 70Â°C was employed. Sequencing reactions were electrophoresed
on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR5 film.

Site-directed mutagenesis. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis
of an expressible 5a-reductase type 2 cDNA (12) was carried out as
described by Zoller and Smith (32) using uracil-containing bacteriophage M13 templates (33). Mutagenic oligonucleotide primers were
20 bases in length. The desired mutant was identified by direct DNA
sequence analysis of single-stranded bacteriophage Ml 3 DNA and reconstructed into the starting pCMV expression vector (34) by standard
methods of genetic engineering (25).
Expression analysis in transfected 293 cells. Normal and mutant
cDNAs were transfected into human embryonic 293 cells (CRL 1573;
American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) as described previously ( 12). Assay of enzyme activity in whole cells, preparation and
assay of cell lysates, and determination of pH optima were carried out
as described previously (11, 12). Immunoblotting of transfected cell
lysates was carried out as per Thigpen and Russell (35), except that a
rabbit antipeptide antiserum specific for the human Sa-reductase 2
isozyme was employed.
Chromosome mapping. Southern blot analysis of normal human
and hamster controls and 14 human X Chinese hamster somatic cell
hybrids derived from six independent fusion experiments (36) was
carried out with a 250-bp MluI-BamHI fragment from the coding region of the human 5a-reductase 2 cDNA as described previously (37).
Chromosomal in situ hybridization was carried out on PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures synchronized as described
by Yunis ( 38) except that the methotrexate block was released by a 5-h

treatment with BrdU (0.1 mM final concentration). Slides were made
immediately after harvest and stored desicated at -20Â°C.
A plasmid (pR5), containing a 20-kb human genomic DNA insert
spanning exons 2-5 of the SRD5A2 gene, was used as a probe after
biotin-dUTP labeling via nick translation (kit from Boehringer Mannheim Corp., Indianapolis, IN). Hybridization was carried out as described previously (37). Probe concentration was 67 ng/Ml, and 200
ng/ul each of human placental and salmon sperm DNA were used as
competitor. After 48 h hybridization at 37Â°C, a biotin/avidin/FITC
detection system was used (39) with one round of amplification. Chromosomes were counter-stained with either propidium iodide or (4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole [DAPI]), both at a final concentration of 160
ng/ml. A Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with epifluorescence
and with a cooled CCD camera (Photometrics PM512)/Macintosh
computer system was used with imaging software (GeneJoinÂ®) supplied
by Tim Rand (Yale University). Photographs were taken on Kodacolor Gold ASA 100 or 400 print film. Signals were counted as specific
only when the FITC signal(s) were observed lying side-by-side on both
chromatids of a chromosome. All single signals were judged to represent random hybridization.

Results
5a-Reductase deficient subjects. Table I summarizes the important clinical, geographical, enzymatic, and genetic features
for the 5a-reductase deficiency subjects analyzed. Affected individuals from 25 families representing 19 ethnic groups were
studied. The diagnosis of 5a-reductase deficiency was based on
clinical findings, family studies, endocrine criteria, and in 21
families on analysis of Sa-reductase activity in cultured skin
fibroblasts. The subjects described in Table I represent over
half (- 55%) of those reported in the literature to date with

5a-reductase deficiency.

Characterization of normal 5a-reductase 2 gene. With the
exception of the gross deletion reported previously in the New
Guinea subjects ( 12), Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA
isolated from affected individuals described in Table I did not
reveal any major rearrangements in the 5a-reductase 2 gene
(data not shown). To detect point mutations, a partial structure for the normal gene was established (Fig. 1). A single
hybridization-positive clone was isolated that spanned the 3'end of the gene after screening three genomic DNA libraries.
Characterization of the cloned genomic fragment revealed the
presence of four exons and four introns. No DNA sequence
differences were found between the exons and the cDNA, and
the positions at which the introns interrupted the coding region
of the gene were identical to those for the type 1 gene (40).
From these data, we inferred that the type 2 gene was composed of five exons and four introns (Fig. 1).

were used to design pairs of oligonucleotides (Fig. 1, Table II)
for use in the PCR. To amplify exon 1, a 5' oligonucleotide
(h5a2-16) was synthesized based on the sequence of the 5'-untranslated region of the cDNA and a 3' oligonucleotide (h5a232) was derived from the cDNA sequence at the predicted
boundary of intron 1 (Fig. 1). A thermocycler program was
identified empirically to amplify all exons of the gene. DNA
fragments of the expected size were detected with each primer
pair, including those used to amplify exon 1 (data not shown).
The latter result indicates that the gene structure shown in Fig.

SSCP analysis of 5a-reductase 2 gene. In most subjects,
mutations in the Sa-reductase 2 gene were detected by SSCP
analyses (Fig. 2). SSCPs were detected in one or more exons of
almost all affected individuals. The differences in migration of
the single stranded DNAs caused by the sequence changes
ranged from the dramatic (e.g., exon 4, 5R2-Sao Paulo-2) to
the subtle (e.g., exon 3, 5R2-New York- I and 5 R2-London-2).
In most cases it was possible to determine the presence ofhomozygosity or compound heterozygosity (Fig. 2). In one instance,
a point mutation in the 5a-reductase 2 gene was not detected
by this technique but was identified by DNA sequencing (see
below). The inheritance of a given SSCP coincided with the
disease in several families, and this method has been used to
diagnose carrier status in individuals of previously unknown
genotype (data not shown).
DNA sequence of mutations. The DNA sequences of the
putative mutations detected by SSCP analysis were determined
by PCR sequencing (Table I). In toto, the 19 mutations not
previously described included 16 amino acid substitutions, a
splice junction alteration, a nonsense codon, and a small deletion. The L224P mutation, present in subject 5R2-Phoenix
(TableI), was detected only by DNA sequencing. Mutations of
only one allele were detected in four individuals (5R2-Los Angeles-1, 5R2-Dallas, 5R2-Chicago-2, and 5R2-New York-3).
We have tentatively classified these latter subjects as heterozygotes. No mutations were detected in two subjects (Los Angeles-3, London-3, Table I). For reasons discussed below, we
believe that5a-reductase deficiency in both the heterozygotes
and the no?bnormality identified group is due to mutations
that map outside of the exon and immediate flanking intron
sequences examined here.
The locations of the mutations in the gene and their consequences for the5a-reductase 2 enzyme are summarized in Fig.
3. Each of the substitution mutations alters an amino acid that
is conserved among the sequenced5a-reductase enzymes ( 12).
This finding suggests that the changes are in fact the cause of
the disease rather than the result of random DNA polymorphisms. In agreement with this suggestion, no affected individual had more than two of the mutations shown in Fig. 3, and
none of the mutations has been detected in multiple normal
individuals (> 31 ) screened to date (data not shown). Identical mutations are present in different ethnic groups (TableI,
Fig. 4) suggesting the possibility of mutational hotspots in the
gene. A complete description of the Dominican Republic mutation has been reported elsewhere (Thigpen, A. E., D. L.
Davis, T. Gautier, J. Imperato-McGinley, and D. W. Russell,
submitted for publication). This mutation is described here for
companson purposes.

severity ofthe disease (i.e., degree of femaleness in 46,XY individuals) and structure-function relationships in the enzyme,
two mutations were produced and analyzed in an expressible
cDNA for 5a-reductase 2 (Table III, Fig. 5). The test cases
represent the extremes of disease manifestation; an arginine
substitution for glycine at position 34 (present in homozygous
form in 5R2-Los Angeles-2, Table I) resulted in a female phenotype with only minor virilization at expected puberty (9). The
second mutation, a serine substitution for a glycine at position
196 (present in homozygous form in 5R2-New Haven, Table
I) produced a predominantly male phenotype (1O).
The mutant cDNAs and a normal control were transfected
into cultured human embryonic 293 cells and assayed in whole
cells and cell lysates for 5a-reductase activity. As shown in
Table III, the Gl 96S mutation reduced enzyme activity in
whole cells to 8.3% of normal, while the G34R mutation reduced activity to 1.7% of normal.
Immunoblotting of lysates from the transfected cells indicated that essentially equal amounts of 5a-reductase protein
were produced from the transfected cDNAs (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that the mutations did not affect the expression or the stability of the enzyme. The G1 96S mutation reduced the affinity of
the enzyme for NADPH but did not alter the apparent Km for
testosterone (Table III). In contrast, the G34R mutation drastically reduced the affinity of the mutant protein for testosterone but did not affect the NADPH Km.
The two substitution mutations changed the pH activity
profiles of the mutant enzymes (Fig. 5 B). The normal 5a-reductase 2 enzyme shows a characteristic narrow acidic pH optimum when assayed in transfected cell lysates (top panel). The
G196S mutation (middle panel) shows a slightly more basic
pH optimum (5.2 vs. 4.9 for normal). The G34R enzyme
shows a different pH profile with a broad peak of activity in the
neutral to basic range (bottom panel). This pH activity profile
is similar to that of the type 1 isozyme of 5a-reductase ( 12, 13).
In experiments not shown, identical results with respect to pH
optima were obtained when the cDNAs were transfected into
simian kidney COS cells, and the subcellular localization of
the mutant proteins was normal as judged by immunocyto-

chemistry.
Chromosomal localization of the Sa-reductase 2 gene. The
chromosomal localization of the disease gene was determined
by in situ hybridization analysis of human lymphocyte prometaphase chromosomes and by Southern blot analysis of so-

matic cell hybrid panels. As shown in Fig. 6, a genomic probe
spanning exons 2-5 of the type 2 gene (symbol SRD5A2) hybridized to band 2p23 on the short arm of chromosome 2. Of
20 metaphases scored, 16 had specific signal on both chromatids of both chromosome 2 homologues at band 2p23, while
two metaphases had specific signal on only one chromosome 2
and the other two metaphases had no specific signal. The identification of the stained chromosomes was possible due to an
R-banding pattern caused by the incorporation of BrdU after
cell synchronization. There was no cross-hybridization detectable between the SRDSA2 gene probe used here and the sites
containing the SRDSA1 gene or the SRDSAPJ pseudogene
(40). In somatic cell hybrid panels, a 250-bp cDNA probe
detected human-specific BglII (8.8 kb) and PstI (14 and 3.5
kb) DNA fragments in all hybrids retaining human chromosome 2. There were at least two discordant hybrids for all other
human chromosomes (data not shown).

Discussion
The current studies describe a molecular genetic analysis of the
5c-reductase type 2 gene in a worldwide cohort of subjects with
male pseudohermaphroditism. 20 different mutations have
been identified in the 5a-reductase type 2 gene on the short
arm of chromosome 2. Over half of the affected individuals
studied were true homozygotes whereas 40% were either compound heterozygotes or inferred compound heterozygotes.
Identical mutations were found in individuals with widely differing geographical and ethnic backgrounds, suggesting the
presence ofmutational hotspots in the gene. Biochemical analysis of two mutations representing opposite poles of disease
manifestation (i.e., feminization of external genitalia versus
predominantly male development), suggested a correlation between clinical expression and severity of the impairment of
enzyme function.
Mutations in the 5a-reductase type 2 gene were present in
all but two individuals (5R2-Los Angeles-3, 5R2-London-3).
The failure to find mutations in these patients could be due to
clinical misdiagnosis, locus heterogeneity in 5a-reductase deficiency, trans-acting mutations, or mutations mapping outside
the coding regions of the type 2 gene. Of these, we favor the
latter explanation inasmuch as the present screen was confined
to the exon and immediately flanking intron regions of the
gene. In addition, a sequence encoding eight amino acids at the

EXON 5
3'-end of exon 1 was not screened due to the location of the
oligonucleotide used to amplify this exon (Fig. 1). Clinical
misdiagnosis is unlikely as these patients met all the criteria of
5a-reductase deficiency and have been thoroughly characterized at the biochemical and endocrine levels. In fact, the 5R2London-3 family has been studied by two different groups ( 18,
24). The existence of the type 1 isozyme of 5a-reductase
renders genetic heterogeneity a formal possibility; however, in
the case of 5R2-Los Angeles-3 the type 1 gene was excluded as
the disease locus ( 13).

Figure 2. Detection of mutations in
5a-reductase type 2 gene by SSCP

analysis. Individual exons were amplified from genomic DNA extracted from the indicated subject
and screened for SSCPs. Exon 1
DNA was cleaved with BamHI before analysis to better resolve SSCPs
in this 337-bp exon. Only the larger
BamHI fragment (244 bp) is shown
in the autoradiogram. All other
exons were analyzed without restriction enzyme digestion. The migrational positions of the double
stranded exon DNAs are indicated
on the left of the autoradiograms.
Subject New York-2 has two mutations in the exon 1 DNA fragment
analyzed here. The relative contributions of these two mutations to
the detected SSCP are not known.

Different mutations at some human loci can confer either a
dominant or recessive inheritance pattern depending on the
structure of the protein affected and the nature of the lesion
(41). If 5a-reductase were to function as a multimer, then the
single mutations found in the four individuals classified as heterozygotes in Table I might compromise the activity of a normal allele and lead to the disease. This type of mutation would
be expected to manifest itself in carrier individuals, i.e., in a
dominant fashion. The family of subject 5R2-Dallas has been
studied by us, and no evidence for the disease was adduced in

Figure 3. Mutations in 5a-reductase type 2 gene and protein. A schematic diagram ofthe 5a-reductase type 2 gene is shown together with
the locations of 20 different mutations. The single letter amino acid
code is used. All substitution mutations occur in amino acids that are
conserved amongst the sequenced Sa-reductase proteins ( 12). Other
mutations either delete a large (ANG) or small (359, ATC) portion of
the gene, alter conserved splice junction signals (725 + 1, G -. T),
or cause premature termination (R227 *). Amino acid numbers refer
to those of the normal 5a-reductase type 2 protein ( 12). Other numbers refer to the normal cDNA and indicate the position at which a
given mutation occurred (e.g., 359, ATC indicates a deletion of a TC
dinucleotide at position 359 ofthe cDNA). Two different mutations
(GGG -. AGG and GGG -- CGG) result in the G34R substitution.
The ANG mutation was described previously ( 12) and the R246W
mutation in the Dominican Republic individuals is extensively characterized in Thigpen, A. E., et al. (submitted for publication). They
are included here for comparison and completeness.

63 known relatives spanning three generations (6). Furthermore, the father of subject 5R2-Dallas is a carrier of the H23 1 R
mutation found in both this individual and an affected sibling,
a finding that rules out dominant inheritance or the occurrence
of a spontaneous mutation. In subject 5R2-Dallas and the
other inferred compound heterozygotes it seems likely that a
more exhaustive study of the Sa-reductase type 2 gene will
reveal a second mutant allele.
In two subjects analyzed at the biochemical level and in
affected individuals from the Dominican Republic described
in another study (Thigpen, A. E., et al., submitted for publication), there appears to be a correlation between the severity of
manifestations and the severity of the impairment of enzyme
function. Thus, the GI 96S mutation identified in a boy (5R2New Haven) with a predominant male phenotype reduces enzyme activity to - 8% of normal when assayed in transfected
whole cells (Table III). The mechanism by which this mutation decreases enzyme activity is presumably related to the
15 fold decrease in affinity of the enzyme for NADPH. The
effect ofthis mutation on the catalytic activity ofthe enzyme in
vivo is difficult to estimate because intracellular concentrations

Aliquots of the normal enzyme (11 g), the G196S enzyme (55 Mg),
and the G34R enzyme (42 Mg) were assayed for 10-30 min at 37Â°C
in the presence of 5 MM testosterone and 10 mM NADPH at the
indicated pHs. The normal enzyme shows a narrow acidic pH optimum centered around 4.9 (upper panel). The G196S mutation
(middle panel) drastically reduces overall enzyme activity relative to
normal (compare ordinate scales) and increases the pH optimum
slightly. The G34R substitution (bottom panel) reduces enzyme activity and dramatically shifts the pH optimum.

of NADPH vary between 50 and 400 ,uM (42). It is therefore
conceivable that the level of 5a-reductase activity in the anlage
of the external genitalia in this subject was sufficient to induce
partial virilization.
In contrast, the G34R mutation found in subject 5R2-Los
Angeles-2 reduces enzyme activity in whole cells to a greater
extent and does so by reducing the affinity of the enzyme for
testosterone substrate some 15-fold (Table III). The intracellular testosterone concentration is not known but is assumed to
be near that of the serum in the fetus (- 50 nmol/liter). At
this substrate concentration, the G34R enzyme is essentially
inactive, thus giving rise to the female phenotype seen in subject 5R2-Los Angeles-2. The finding that the G34R mutation
in the type 2 isozyme alters the substrate Km agrees well with a
study (35) that mapped determinants of a competitive inhibi-

tor to residues 26-29 of the type 1 isozyme of 5a-reductase.
Together these results suggest that the substrate binding domain of 5a-reductase is encoded at least in part by residues
encoded by exon 1.
Both G34R and G 1 96S mutations shift the pH optimum of
the 5a-reductase enzyme (Fig. 5 B). A narrow acidic pH optimum distinguishes the type 2 from the type 1 isozyme, which
has a broad neutral to basic pH optimum. The biochemical
basis for the acidic pH optimum of the type 2 enzyme is unknown, but this feature is also present in the rat type 2 enzyme
(Normington, K., and D. W. Russell, unpublished observations) and is observed in multiple mammalian cell lines in
which a type 2 human cDNA has been expressed (Thigpen, A.
E., and D. W. Russell, unpublished observations). These data
and the finding that the two substitution mutations shift the
pH optimum, suggest that the acid requirement is an inherent
feature of the enzyme and not a consequence of an inhibitor in
the cell lysate or a cell type-specific membrane environment.
The acidic pH optimum may represent an artifact associated with cell lysis or reflect localization ofthe type 2 enzyme
within an acidic subcellular compartment. The G34R and
G 1 96S mutations appear to alter the conformation of the
membrane-bound enzyme in such a manner that the requirement for an acid environment is reduced. The acidic pH optimum of the normal enzyme may thus reflect an activation
requirement. The study of additional naturally occurring and
synthetic mutations in the type 2 enzyme may shed further
light on this interesting feature.
The two 5a-reductase genes are nonsyntenic: the type 1
gene (symbol SRD5AI) is located in band p15 on the short
arm of chromosome 5 (40), and the type 2 gene (symbol
SRD5A2) is located in band p23 on the short arm of chromosome 2 (Fig. 6). The different chromosomal locations of these
genes is consistent with their divergence at the DNA sequence

level (50% identity). SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 have similar gene
architectures (5 exons/4 introns) and the positions at which
introns interrupt the genes are identical between them (Fig. 1;
ref. 40). These findings suggest that they arose as a consequence of an ancient duplication event and subsequently
evolved separate physiological roles. The function of the type 2
gene is defined by 5a-reductase deficiency, while the role ofthe
type 1 gene in adrogen physiology has not yet been elucidated.
5a-Reductase deficiency leading to male pseudohermaphroditism is a rare autosomal recessive disorder whose frequency has not been directly measured. The finding that almost half of the subjects analyzed here are known or presumed
compound heterozygotes suggests that the carrier frequency of
mutations in the type 2 gene may be quite high. The reasons
behind and the effects of a putative high carrier frequency of
mutations in the Sa-reductase type 2 gene are not known. The
apparent recurrent mutations identified here (Fig. 4) suggest
the possibility of mutational hotspots (43) in the gene that
might lead to an increased carrier frequency. Alternatively,
there may be an as yet unidentified selective advantage to heterozygous carriers.
Mutations leading to subtle abnormalities in the enzyme
may underlie some forms of commonly encountered urogenital birth defect in males such as hypospadias or microphallus.
Along these same lines, regulatory defects in the type 1 or type
2 genes may underlie a wide variety of androgen-dependent
disorders such as male pattern baldness, acne, hirsutism, and
benign or cancerous growth of the prostate. The availability of
DNA probes for both genes should allow the future definition
of the genetic role of Sa-reductase in these diseases.
