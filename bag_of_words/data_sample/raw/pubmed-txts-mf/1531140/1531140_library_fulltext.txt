The molecular basis of a dramatically decreased
steady state level of
&hexosaminidase B subunit mRNA
in a patient with juvenile Sandhoff disease was investigated. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the HEXB
gene coding for the fi subunit revealed two single base
substitutions, one in exon2 (A to G, a known polymorphism) and the other in exon 11 (C to T).Analysis of
the j3 subunit mRNA species demonstrated activation
of a cryptic splice site in exon 11 as well as skipping
of the exon.A transfection assay using a chimeric gene
containing intron 10 flanked by cDNA sequences carrying themutation confirmed that the singlebase substitution located at position 8 of exon 11 inhibits the
selection of the normal 3’ splice site. The results demmutation affecting 3’ splice
onstrate a new type of exon
site selection.

Sandhoff disease (0-variant GMP gangliosidosis) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations of the @ subunit
which result in reduced activities of both Hex A and B (1).
As only Hex A canhydrolyze G M z ganglioside in the presence
of G M z activator protein (13, 14), Hex A deficiency is responsible for the neuronal storage of G M 2 ganglioside in the central
nervous system and peripheral nerves,
On the basis of clinical signs and symptoms, as well as the
age at onset, three principal clinical phenotypes of Sandhoff
disease (infantile, juvenile, and adult forms) have been established. In the infantile form, onset occurs within the first 5
months of age, and the disease is characterized by psychomotor retardation, amaurosis, and macular cherry-red spots,
with death by 4 years ofage (1). Recent molecular genetic
analysis has revealed a 50-kb deletion (15) and a 16-kb Alutype deletion (16) in the HEXB gene of patients with the
infantile form. Neote et al. (16) reported that two patients
with the infantile disease were homozygous for the Alu-type

EXPERIMENTALPROCEDURES

Patient
The patient was a 39-year-old Japanese male with a mild clinical
presentation of mental retardationand local panatrophy. The parents
were first cousins. Hex A activity of the patient’s leukocytes and
fibroblasts were decreased to 6 and 8% of control, respectively. Hex
B activity was undetectable. Rectal biopsy demonstrated membranous
cytoplasmic bodies in neurons of Meissner’s plexus. Urinary excretion
of large amount of neutral oligosaccharides was demonstrated, which
were consistent with the storage of the substrates due to the Hex A
and B deficiencies.

Synthesis of Oligonucleotides
Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) or provided by
Dr. R. A. Gravel, Montreal Children's Hospital, Montreal, Canada.
Northern Blot Analysis
Total RNAwas extracted from cultured skin fibroblasts (21).
Poly(A)+ RNA (5 pg) prepared by oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography was electrophoresed through a 1.2% formaldehyde/agarose gel and was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The filter
was hybridized with a 32P-labeledHex fl subunit cDNA probe (22).
After the hybridization, the filter was washed to a final stringency of
0.1 X SSC, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 60 "C for 20 minutes (1X
SSC = 150 mM NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0). Autoradiography was done using an intensifying screen. The same filter was
used for rehybridization with "P-labeled Hex a subunit cDNA or (3
actin genomic DNA.
Southern Blot Analysis
PCR products were electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose gel
and were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After hybridization with 32P-labeled Hex 0 subunit cDNA (22), the filters were
washed to a final stringency of 0.1 X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 "C for 10
min and autoradiographed.
Amplification of HEXB Genomic DNA
We identified unique sequences in the HEXB gene (11) for the
selection of oligonucleotide primers after a computer search of the
GenBank data base to avoid sequences homologous to other genes.
One of each oligonucleotide pair was constructed with an EcoRI or a
HindIII linker sequence at the 5' end (Table IA). One microgram of
a control or the patient's genomic DNA wassubjected to 30 cycles of

2407

PCR consisting of denaturation at 94 "C for 1min, annealing at 53 "C
for 1 min, and primer extension at 72 "C for 3 min (23).
Analysis of mRNA Species by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of 10
pgof total RNA from normal or the patient's fibroblasts with 400
units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and 10
pmol of specific antisense primers (Table IB)in a reaction volume of
20 gl (24). The cDNA product was subjected to 30 cycles of PCR
consisting of denaturation at 94 "C for 30 s, annealing at 55 "C for
30 s, and extension at 72 "C for 1 min. Four pairs of oligonucleotides
were designed to cover the entire subunit mRNA with overlapping
regions (Table IB).
Nucleotide Sequence Analysis
PCR products were subcloned into a plasmid vector, pUC19, and
more than 5 clones were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain
terminator method using double-stranded DNA as templates (25).
MspZ Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism of the Family
Members and Normal Controls
One microgram of genomic DNA from family members or normal
controls was amplified using the specific primers, exon10: 5'GGTTTTGGATATTATTGCAACCATAAA-3' and exon 11: 5'GGAGCAGAAAGGATTACAGGGAAGCCA-3'. The PCR products
were digested with MspI, andthe digested and undigested PCR
products were electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose gel.

of pcDHex8 was replaced with the AflII and Bsu36I fragment of
pKSHexa2. The resultantconstruct, pcDHexBM8, contained the
exon 11 mutation but was otherwise identical with pcDHexB.
Step 2: Introduction of Exon 2 Mutation-A PCR product carrying
the exon 2 mutationwas generated by PCR amplification of pcDHex8
using the following primers, of which one primer contained the
mutant sequence (exon 2: 5'-GCTGAATTCCAGGCTAGAACCCA3' (mutation underlined); exon 8 5"ATCTCCTCCCAAATGAAT3'). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and inserted into
EcoRI-cleaved pcDHexaM8. The resultant plasmid, pcDHexB(Lys12'

Arg) and the exon 11 mutation (Pro4" + Leu), but was otherwise
identical with pcDHex8, a full length human Hex 8 subunit cDNA in

each cycle consisted of a 30-s denaturation at 94 "C, 30-s annealing
at 58 "C, and a 1-min extension at 72 "C. A 3-pl aliquot from each
PCR product was analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
1 X TBE (0.089 M Tris-borate, 0.089 M boric acid, and 0.002 M

for amplification of reverse transcripts by PCR. These sense primers
have 18 identical nucleotides of exon 10 sequence in addition to the
first 5 nucleotides of each of different splice junctions (Fig. 7) as

promoter region includingputative GCboxes, CAAT box, and
AP-1-like binding sequences, as well as all splice junctions
and the 3’ noncoding region including the polyadenylation
signal, were identical with those of control. Among the exon
sequences, however, two single base substitutions were identified. One, a C to T transition substitutingleucine forproline
417 (CCG to CTG,Fig. 3A), was found in exon11.The other,
an A to G transition substituting arginine for
lysine 121 (AAA
to AGA, Fig. 3 B ) was found in exon 2. The latter has been
shown to be polymorphic among normal populations and is
presumed not tobe associated with thedisease.2
The Candidate for the Disease Mutation, the Pro to Leu

diagnostic testfor the mutationby examining MspI restriction
products after PCR amplification of surrounding sequences.
The parents and the sister were shown to be heterozygous,
and the patient was homozygous‘for the mutation (Fig. 4).
Furthermore, the allele was not found in any of 36 normal

mutations in circumstances where RNA splicing is not involved. The mutantcDNA construct, pcDHex@(Lys”’+Arg,

is otherwise identical with the original pcDHexp. Transient
expression of the pcDHexp(LysI2’ 4 Arg, Pro4’: + Leu) in
COS cells gave increased Hex activitycomparable to that
seenin COS cells transfected withpcDHexp, the normal
human Hex /3 subunit cDNA (Fig. 5).
Identification of Aberrant Splicing of Hex P Subunit
mRNA-The results described above suggested that the dramatically decreased steady state level of the Hex @ subunit
mRNA in the patient’s cells is the primary cause for the
decreased Hex A and B activities, because the mutant Hex p
subunit carrying Pro4’‘+ Leu and Lys”)‘ + Arg is as active
as the wild type Hex /3 subunit. Since we did not detect any
mutations in the promoter region of the HEXB gene, we
surmised that thereduction in steady statemRNA was likely
due to instability of the mRNA. As nonfunctional mRNA is
the most frequent cause of such instability, we analyzed the

inhibits normal splicing rather than directs the selection of
the novel species. First, the major aberrant species, P2, was
found in reduced levels (0.6%) in normal cells. Secondly, the
transfection of COS cells with normal cDNA containing intron 10 produced normal (Pl) and abnormal (P2) transcripts
showing that P2 canbe a significantly selected product inthis
cell type. Thus, our results point to a shift in the ratio of the
three identified species: normal P1 (>99%): P2 (0.6%): P3
(undetected) compared to mutantP1 (11):P2 (2): P3 (l),with
the overall levels in the latter case significantly reduced (8%
of control, Fig. 8C). In fact, with the likelihood that P2 and
P3 areinherently unstable species, the actual ratio of synthesis may favor higher levels of P2 and possibly P3 in normal
cells and the majority of synthesis of these species in mutant
cells. Thus, we propose that the mutation, eight nucleotides
into the exon adjacent to the splicing acceptor site, inhibits
the recognition of the normal splice position, therebyallowing
an increase in species normally present in very low or undetectable levels.
The most frequentcause of aberrant splicing of the 3‘ splice
siteis deletions or mutations (31-46) affecting the splice
acceptor consensus sequence, NCAG/G (49, 50). Also, single
base mutations within introns have been reported to create
new acceptor splice sites (17, 18, 47, 48). None of these
mechanisms can explainthe aberrantsplicing observed in the
present case.
Recent in vitro studies of pre-mRNA splicing in higher
eukaryotes have demonstrated that splicing of individual introns takes place in two steps after assembly of the premRNA into the large multicomponent complex, termeda
spliceosome, which is comprised of multiple small ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particles (reviewed in Refs. 51 and 52).
Although factors including U2 snRNP (53-55), U5 snRNP
(56), hnRNP C protein (57), 70-kDa intron binding protein
(58, 59), U2AF (60), several hnRNP proteins (61), and P62
(62), have been shown to associate with sequences upstream
of the 3’ splice site or to the3’ consensus AG sequence, there
is no evidence for factor bindingto exon sequence downstream
of the selected splice site. Our results suggest a role for
adjacent 3’ sequences, whether they might participate through
factorbinding or in the secondary structure of the RNA
molecule in its association with the spliceosome.
There areprecedents for exon mutation disrupting normal
splicing. For example, it hasbeen shown that exon mutations
involving insertions or deletions affect the splicing of SV 40
mRNAs (63). Reed and Maniatis (64) showed that usage of
the adjacent splice site is decreased when a normal human
exon sequence was replaced by a highly homologous mouse
exon. Furdon and Kole (65) showed that efficiency of splicing
of human @-globinpre-mRNA depends on the length of the
second exon, and insertion of a fragment of @-globinintron 2
within exon 2 was shown to poison splicing. In the human
fibronectin gene, a deletion of 81 nucleotides of the EDIIIA
exon was shown to eliminate alternate splicing (66). Similar
deletion studies showed that a 3’ exon sequence is essential
for splicing of the bovine growth hormone pre-mRNA (67)
and avianretrovirus RNA (68). Moreover, these deletion
studies showed a significant decrease in the level of spliceosome assembly (68).
Very recently, a single A/G nucleotide polymorphism in
exon 2 of the episialin gene, eight nucleotides downstream of
the second splice acceptor site, was shown to affect 3’ splice
site selection (69), a finding quite similarto the presentcase.
They proposed the interesting hypothesis that the A to G
substitution results in the formation of an altered secondary
structure of the pre-mRNA, which makes the splice acceptor

site inaccessible to the splicing machinery. Previous studies
have also suggested that the structure of stable hairpins of
pre-mRNA can influence splice site selection (70-76). In the
present case, there is a possibility that the exon 11 mutation
affects the secondary structure of Hex @ subunit pre-mRNA.
The present study has reinforced the importance of exon
sequences in the splicing reaction and provides interesting
insight into 3‘ splice site selection, whose detailed mechanism
remains to be elucidated.
