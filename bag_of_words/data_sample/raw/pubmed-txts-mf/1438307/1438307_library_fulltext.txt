The human testis-determining factor resides
ABSTRACT
within a 35-kilobase (kb) region of the Y chromosome immediately adjacent to the pseudoautosomal buary. A candidate gene for human sex determination (SRY) was isolated in
this region. Here, we describe a study of 25 cases of XY females
with pure gonadal dysgenesis for mutations on the Y chromosome short arm, including SRY. Southern blotting revealed a
sex-reversed female harboring a deletion extending from -8 kb
from the pseudoautosomal boundary of the Y chromosome to
at least 33 kb and no more than 60 kb upstream, toward the
centromere. The deletion begins no more than 1.8 kb upstream
from the first ATG of the SRY open reading frame present in
the clone pY53.3. To our knowledge, no mutation has been
described previously outside the SRY "HMG box" on the short
arm of the Y chromosome, which is assoiated with sex
reversal. Since the 5' extent of the SRY tnswriptional unit has
not been defined, the deletion may remove up m exons of
SRY and/or transcriptional regulatory motifs, either situation
resulting in lack of ticular development. It cannot be formally excluded that the mutation removes a second locus,
independent of SRY, that is critical for sex deternmnation.
Denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the SRY
open reading frame in the remaining 24 cases revealed de novo
single base-pair transitions in the SRY conserved domain in 4
cases.
Sex is determined by the presence or absence of a testisdetermining factor (TDF) encoded by a gene on the short arm
of the Y chromosome (1). If this factor is present testes will
be formed and the embryo will develop as a male. In its
absence the fetal gonads will develop as ovaries. Certain XY
individuals fail to form testes and, instead, develop as completely phenotypic females with dysgenetic streak gonads. It
is probable on the basis of this phenotype that these individuals harbor mutations that disrupt the initial events in the
testis-determining/differentiation pathway.
A study of 3 XX males and an XX true hermaphrodite
defined the location of TDF to a 35-kilobase (kb) sequence
located immediately adjacent to the pseudoautosomal boundary (2). Within this region an open reading frame (ORF) was
isolated that is part of the gene termed SRY (3). There is
considerable evidence to suggest that SR Y encodes a factor
necessary for the initiation of testis formation (3-5). In three
studies of 40 XY females with gonadal dysgenesis, 5 individuals were found to harbor mutations in the SRY ORE, of
which 4 were de novo (6-8). All mutations were present in the
conserved domain of the SR Y ORE, which is related to the
HMG box of the high mobility group proteins (9). This motif

has a DNA-binding capacity, which is consistent with a role
as a primary signal in the sex-determining pathway (10, 11).
Here we describe the analysis of 25 XY females with pure
gonadal dysgenesis (PGD) for mutations in the Y chromosome short arm proximal to the pseudoautosomal boundary,
including SRY. In one case a deletion of at least 25 kb but no
more than 50 kb was found in the Y chromosome short arm
5' to the SR Y HMG box. To our knowledge, no deletion has
been reported previously on the Y short arm outside of the
SRY HMG box. Denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis
(DGGE) revealed four individuals who harbored de novo
single base-pair transitions in the conserved HMG-like box of
SRY.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients. All patients were considered classical 46,XY
females with PGD on the basis of (i) unambiguous female
external genitalia, (ii) absence of differentiated gonads, only
streak gonads being present, and (iii) presence of normally
developed Mullerian structures, including uterus and fallo-

pian tubes. In each case there was no evidence of Turner
stigmata, mental retardation, or short stature. Individuals
AS, LG, and NV were from India, Portugal, and France,
respectively. The remaining individuals were ascertained
from France and North Africa. All cases were sporadic.
There was no difference in the phenotypes between the
sex-reversed females AS, LG, and NV. Histological examination of the streak gonad of individuals AS, LG, and NV
revealed typical wavy ovarian-type stroma with no tubule
structures present. NV also had a gonadoblastoma in her
right streak gonad and, in certain areas, a spermatocytic
seminoma. An aspect of embryonal carcinoma was observed
in the left streak gonad stroma.
Southern Analysis. Genomic DNA was prepared from
peripheral blood lymphocytes. Ten-microgram samples were
digested with restriction endonucleases according to the
manufacturer's recommended conditions. Agarose gel electrophoresis, transfer to nylon membranes (Hybond N, Amersham), prehybridization, hybridization to 32P-labeled
probes, and autoradiography were performed essentially as
described elsewhere (12). Blots were hybridized with the
probes pY53.3, pDP1225, p09, pDP1226, and pDP1007 (2, 3,
13-15). Paternity was checked using minisatellite DNA
probes (16).
DGGE. Computer analysis was performed using the
MELT87 and SQHTX programs provided by L. Lerman (17).

These computer algorithms predict the melting behavior of a
DNA fragment on the basis of its base composition and its
nucleotide sequence. This information was used to select
positions of PCR primers located within the SR Y ORF,
allowing generation of a fragment suitable for DGGE analysis. The primer sequences were SRYA (ACAAAGAATCTGGTAGAACGTGAG) and SRYD (GTAAGTGGCCTAGCTGGTG). The primer SRYD carried, at its 5' end,
an additional (G+C)-rich oligomer (45-mer) needed to create
a high-temperature melting domain (18). As a consequence,
the SR Y sequence becomes the first melting domain and can
be analyzed throughout.
PCRs were performed using 50-100 ng of genomic DNA in
a reaction mixture consisting of 200 tkM (each) dNTP, 0.1 ,uM
(each) primer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.3), and two units of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase in a total volume of 50 1A. After initial denaturation
at 940C for 4 mn, samples were subjected to 40 cycles of 1 min
at 940C, 1 min at 550C, and 2 min at 72TC. Since the resolution
of DGGE is increased by examining heteroduplexes, 10 gI of
sample was mixed with 10 1L4 of a normal male control. Prior
to loading on denaturing gels the samples were denatured
(940C, 4 min) and then annealed (420C, 1 hr).
The PCR products were electrophoresed in a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel with a linearly increasing gradient from 20%
to 70% denaturant (100% denaturant is 7 M urea and 40%o
formamide) at 160 V for 4 hr under conditions previously
described (19).
Direct DNA Sequencing. SRY genomic DNA fragments
were asymmetrically amplified and directly sequenced using
Sequenase (United States Biochemical) essentially as described elsewhere (20).
Detection of Genomic Sequences Recognized by the Probe
pYRO.4. Amplification of genomic DNA was performed using
the primers R041 (GCGTGCTGCTAGCGCTATAT) and
R04G (TCGATGTGGCTCCAAGTAGC), which generate an
amplified product of 120 base pairs (bp). One hundred
nanograms of genomic DNA was heated to 94° C for 4 min and
then subjected to 30 cycles in a total volume of 100 IlI
containing dNTPs (each at 200 ,uM), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 units
of Taq polymerase, and each oligonucleotide at 0.25 uM.
Each cycle consisted of 94° C for 1 min, 58° C for 1 min, and
72° C for 2 min. The extension step after the last cycle was for
10 min. PCR products were electrophoresed in a 1.3%
agarose gel, transferred to Hybond N membrane, and hybridized with 32P end-labeled oligonucleotide R04K (CTATGCGCACCCGTTCTCGGAGC) following the manufacturer's recommended conditions.
Detection of SRY, RPS4X, and RPS4Y Transcripts. cDNA
was synthesized from total RNA using random hexamers as
described elsewhere (21). Primers used for detection of SRY
expression were EVSRYA (AACAGCGATGATTACAGTCCAG) and SRYHMGB (TAGAGCCATCTTGCGCCTCTG).
Primers used for the RPS4 amplifications were RPS4C (GCTGAGGGAATGTCTTCCTCTGAT), RPS4B (CCATGAATCCAGCAGGGTATGTGAT), and RPS42 (TTGATTATCTTGCCAGTCC). The primer RPS4C recognizes sequences common to RPS4X and RPS4 Y transcripts, whereas
RPS4B and RPS42 are specific for RPS4X and RPS4Y transcripts, respectively. Amplification of RPS4X results in a
fragment of 132 bp, whereas amplification ofRPS4Yresults in
the generation of a fragment of 342 bp. In each amplification,
10 ng of cDNA was heated to 94° C for4 min and then subjected
to 30 cycles in a total volume of 100 ,u containing all four
dNTPs (each at 200 AuM), 1.0 mM MgCl2, 1 unit of Taq
polymerase, and each oligonucleotide at 0.25 AM. Each cycle
consisted of 940C for 1 min, 560C for 1 min, and 720C for 1 min.

RESULTS
To check for the presence of mutations in the Y short arm
adjacent to the pseudoautosomal boundary, DNA samples
from XY females with PGD were screened by Southern
hybridization using the probes pY53.3, pDP1225, p09,
pDP1226, and pDP1007. The hybridization pattern observed
for these probes was similar to that observed in DNA from a
normal male in 24 of the 25 cases (data not shown). In one
case (NV) a different hybridization pattern was observed
compared to a normal male. This XY female had a Y-specific
2.1-kb HindIII fragment when probed with pY53.3, which
recognizes sequences corresponding to SRY (Fig. 1). A
fragment of similar size was detected in DNA from her father.
Digestion of NV DNA with Stu I followed by probing with
pY53.3 revealed a change in fragment size from 9 kb to 3 kb.
An additional fragment of 6 kb was present in female NV, her
father, and a normal male. Digestion with HindIII and
probing with pDP1225, which recognizes Y-specific sequences 5' to SR Y, showed a reduction in fragment size
compared to a normal male from 5.5 kb to 1.5 kb. This
indicates that the deletion extends upstream from the SR Y
HMG box and begins no more than -1.8 kb upstream from
the first ATG of the SR Y ORE present in the clone pY53.3.
Since the hybridization patterns for the father and the normal
male were identical when probed with pY53.3 and pDP1226,
it indicates that the change in band size was not due to a
simple polymorphism and is de novo.
The presence of a deletion in NV was confirmed using the
probe p09. Probe p09 hybridizes to sequences =18 kb from
the pseudoautosomal boundary. Sequences recognized by
this probe were present in a normal male control and the
father of NV but were absent in NV. Y-specific sequences
recognized by the probe pYRO.4 were not detected by
amplification of DNA from NV using the primers R041 and
R04G followed by hybridization with the probe R04K. These
sequences were detected in samples from her father and a
normal male (Fig. 1).
Hybridization patterns obtained using the Y-specific
clones pDP1226 and pDP1007, which correspond to coding
sequences of RSP4 Y and ZFY, were similar in samples from
NV, her father, and a control male. The deletion present in
NV therefore extends from -8 kb to at least 33 kb and no
more than 60 kb from the Y pseudoautosomal boundary
toward the centromere (Fig. 1).
DGGE analysis of the SR Y ORF in NV and in a normal
male showed that both were identical (data not shown). To
determine if the deletion gave rise to ectopic SR Yexpression,
reverse PCR was prepared from a lymphoblastoid cell line
prepared from peripheral blood lymphocytes of NV. SRY
expression was not detected in this cell line (data not shown).
RPS4Y and RPS4X are ubiquitously transcribed (22). The
transcriptional unit of RPS4 Y is in the opposite orientation to
SR Y: transcription proceeds in the direction of the pseudoautosomal boundary toward the centromere. To determine if
the deletion prevented induction of RPS4Y transcription,
RPS4 Y-specific transcripts were detected by reverse transcriptase PCR. The primer RPS4C recognizes coding sequences present in RPS4X and RPS4 Y, whereas the primers
RPS4B and RPS42 are RPS4X and RPS4 Y specific, respectively. Transcripts coding for RPS4X and RPS4Y were detected in cDNA prepared from RNA from normal male
lymphocytes, whereas only transcripts coding for RPS4X
could be detected in cDNA prepared from normal female
lymphocytes (Fig. 2). Expression of RPS4X and RPS4 Y was
detected in lymphoblastoid cells prepared from NV.
The SRY coding sequences within the fragment pY53.3
were assayed for the presence of mutations by DGGE. DNA
samples from four individuals showed heteroduplex formation (data not shown). Direct PCR sequencing of the SR Y

DISCUSSION
We have analyzed the sex-determining region of the Y
chromosome, including SRY, for mutations in 25 XY females
with POD. One individual was identified with a deletion in the
Y chromosome short arm, immediately 5' of the SRY ORF.
This deletion extended from =8 kb to at least 33 kb and no
more than 60 kb upstream from the Y autosomal boundary
toward the centromere. The deletion begins no more than 1.8
kb 5' ofthe first ATG of the SR YORF present in pY53.3. The
known SRY coding sequences in this individual were identical to those present in a normal male. Reverse PCR analysis
of SR Y expression in a lymphoblastoid cell line prepared
from NV showed that the deletion did not result in ectopic
SRY expression. Since the 5' extent of the SRY transcriptional unit has not been defined, it is probable that this
deletion removes either an additional upstream exon and/or
transcriptional regulatory motifs, either situation resulting in
a lack of testicular determination during embryonic development. It cannot be formally excluded that the deletion
removes a second gene necessary for testis determination as
well as SRY. If such a gene exists, it must be present within
35 kb proximal to the pseudoautosomal boundary since this
is the minimum amount of Y material present in certain XX
males that can confer a male phenotype. However searches
within this area based on sequence conservation between
different mammalian species have failed to detect any such

gene(s).
The deletion in female NV extends from 5' to the SRY
HMG box to the 5' part of the gene RPS4Y. This gene
encodes 1 of 33 proteins that make up the small subunit of the

human ribosome (22). It has an X homologue RPS4X that
escapes inactivation. Both genes are ubiquitously transcribed. It has been suggested that haploinsufficiency of
RPS4 genes may contribute to the Turner phenotype. Turner
syndrome females are characterized by short stature, gonadal
dysgenesis, and various anatomic abnormalities (24). Deletion analysis of certain XY females with and without the
somatic abnormalities characteristic of Turner syndrome has
indicated that the Turner phenotype maps to interval 1 or 2
of the Y short arm (25, 26). Within this region the gene RPS4Y
has been cloned. Individual NV presented with PGD without
any of the somatic abnormalities associated with Turner
syndrome. If the presence of RPS4Y prevents features characteristic of the Turner phenotype, the RPS4Ytranscriptional
unit must be conserved. Using reverse PCR techniques,
RPS4Y- and RPS4X-specific transcripts were detected in
normal male lymphocytes and a cell line prepared from
female NV. This indicates that the deletion does not prevent
induction of RPS4Y transcription, although it cannot be
excluded that the level of RPS4Yexpression in NV is reduced
compared to a normal male. Expression of RPS4Y in NV is
consistent with the hypothesis that RPS4Y prevents some of
the somatic features characteristic of the Turner phenotype.
Detailed mapping of this deletion may help define the RPS4Y
transcriptional unit.
The SR Y ORF was analyzed for mutations by DGGE in all
25 XY females. Four cases were found who harbored mutations in the SRYORF, each present in the HMG box. Two of
these cases were previously described (6, 23). The two new
mutations were de novo, single base-pair substitutions, which
resulted in the generation of a stop codon and a conservative
isoleucine to threonine amino acid change. The introduction
of a stop codon in the HMG box would almost certainly result
in a nonfunctional SR Y gene product. The conservative
isoleucine to threonine amino acid change occurs at a position whose amino acid residue is variable between HMG box
proteins; nevertheless, since the mutation is de novo and
associated with an XY female phenotype, the amino acid
change presumably alters the functional activity of SRY.
There are now seven reported cases of 46,XY sex-reversed
females harboring de novo mutations in the SRY ORF. Each
mutation is present in the conserved HMG-like box and
hence may affect the DNA-binding activity of the protein.

Sex reversal in the remaining XY females with no detectable
mutations in the testis-determining region of the Y short arm
may be caused by X chromosomal or autosomal mutations in
the male sex-determining/differentiation pathway. Familial
cases of sex reversal have been described compatible with
X-linked recessive and autosomal recessive patterns of inheritance (27). Alternatively, it is possible that some of these
individuals harbor mutations in other exons/promoter elements that are necessary for proper SR Y function and expression and that were not detected by Southern blotting
used in this study.
Note Added in Proof. While this manuscript was in press, Vilain et al.
(28) defined the SRY transcription initiation site at -91 bp upstream
from the first ATG present in the clone pY53.3. The deletion is
therefore -1.7 kb 5' to the SRY transcription initiation site.
