ABSTRACT
The Lesch-Nyhan disease is caused by an almost complete
lack of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Partial HPRT-deficiency, associated with
less severe phenotype, has also been identified. We have
characterized mutations occurring in HPRT cDNA isolated
from patients with HPRT-deficiency with an emphasis on
examining the more unusual partial variants of HPRTdeficiency. HPRT cDNA was amplified by PCR, cloned and
analyzed by automated DNA sequence analysis. Twenty-two,
unrelated individuals with HPRT deficiency were studied
including eight classic Lesch-Nyhan patients and fourteen
patients representing the different groups of partial HPRT
deficiency. We found a diverse pattern of mutations with point
mutations accounting for the majority of abnormal HPRT
genes. Nonsense mutations and exon deletions were only found
in HPRT cDNA isolated from classic Lesch-Nyhan patients.
Mutations associated with partial HPRT-deficiency were
frequently located in the amino terminal part of the molecule.
A CpG mutational hot spot was identified at the position for
Arg-51 in the HPRT protein. Two hyperuricemk patients
exhibited unusual splice site mutations: in one this led to the
creation of an additional exon in the HPRT gene and in the
other part of exon 6 was missing in a subpopulation of the
transcripts, producing the effect of a dominant, negative
mutation.
INTRODUCTION
The Lesch-Nyhan disease (1), an inherited, X-linked recessive
disorder of purine metabolism is caused by an almost complete
lack of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT; EC
2.4.2.8.) activity (2,3). The disease is characterized by
hyperuricemia, neurologic dysfunction, including severe spasticity
and choreoathetoid movements, mental retardation, and a typical
self-injurious behavior. Partial deficiency of HPRT has been
described in a variety of patients with phenotypic differences
ranging from isolated hyperuricemia to varying degrees of
neurologic dysfunction. Notably, in HPRT deficiency there is
an inverse correlation between residual HPRT enzyme activity,
as measured in an intact cell assay, and the severity of the
neurologic disease (4,5). Also, HPRT-deficient individuals from
the same pedigree have a very similar disease. This is in contrast

to many other genetic disorders e.g. medium chain acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase deficiency (6) and Gaucher's disease (7) in which
patients with identical mutations, and thus similar levels of
residual enzyme activity, can have very different clinical course
of the disease. The most common phenotypes of partial deficiency
of HPRT are gout or nephropathy and normal cerebral function.
The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome occurs with an incidence of 1 in
100,000 to 1 in 380,000. The incidence of partial HPRT
deficiency is not known but is lower than the classic
Lesch—Nyhan disease.
Human HPRT has been purified to homogeneity and its amino
acid sequence determined (8). The native enzyme is comprised
of four identical subunits, each containing 217 amino acids.
Structural studies on the human HPRT gene (9,10) have identified
9 exons spanning about 44 kb of DNA on the long arm of the
X chromosome. Molecular studies have facilitated the search for
mutations underlying deficiency of HPRT, and with the
introduction of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the number
of mutations identified in the HPRT gene has rapidly increased
(11 -16). In the majority of patients with HPRT deficiency there
is no gross alteration of the gene. The spectrum of mutations
reported to date is broad with the same mutation rarely being
found in unrelated pedigrees and includes point mutations,
deletions, insertions, and duplications. Most of the reported
mutations in HPRT have been derived from patients with the
classic Lesch—Nyhan syndrome.
In this report we have extended the search for mutations in
the HPRT gene with an emphasis on examining a spectrum of
phenotypes from classic Lesch—Nyhan to classic partial with
clinical gout, and including the more unusual variants that exhibit
hyperuricemia and neurologic dysfunction without the complete
Lesch—Nyhan picture.
RESULTS
This study includes eight classic Lesch—Nyhan patients, five
neurologic variants, and nine patients with hyperuricemia as the
only manifestation of the disease. HPRT enzyme activity was
measured in fibroblast cell lines, established from each patient,
using an intact cell assay (5). The data on enzyme activity, shown
in Table I, were consistent with the inverse correlation between
clinical severity of the disease and residual enzyme activity

observed in earlier studies. Table I also summarizes the nucleotide
changes that were identified in the HPRT cDNA isolated from
the patients.
Cell lines from two of the subjects, DM (GM 1662, 25) and
JF (1734, 15) were shared with other investigators and the data
in Table I are identical to those reported in their studies. However,
DM was listed (25) as a classic Lesch-Nyhan patient, but his
phenotype was actually that of a partial variant with neurologic
symptoms (26). JF was a patient with hyperuricemia and no
neurologic abnormalities (27).
Of the eight classic Lesch-Nyhan patients, HPRT cDNA
isolated from three (AS, MS, PW) exhibited nonsense mutations.
The HPRT cDNAs of AS and MS had identical mutations that
changed the codon for Arg-51 into a stop codon. In the HPRT
cDNA of PW a premature stop site replaced the codon for
Ser-123. Exon skipping (exon 4, RT and exon 7, DL) was found
in two instances. Three missense mutations were identified in
this group and resulted in the substitution of Asp for Gly at residue
16 (FG), Leu for Phe at residue 73 (DW) and Tyr for Asp at
residue 201 (GM).
Partial HPRT deficiency with neurologic symptoms can be
divided into at least two clinical groups based on die neurologic
manifestations. In one group patients have a neurologic
examination indistinguishable from the classic Lesch-Nyhan
patient whereas in the other group the neurologic symptoms are
less severe. We sequenced HPRT cDNA isolated from three (HB,
LW, DM) patients belonging to the former clinical group (26,28)
and from two (AA, RW) representing the latter (29). In the first
three patients we identified two missense mutations. One led to

on 13 April 2018

the substitution of Gly for Val at amino acid 8 (HB) and the other
to Pro for Ala at residue 50 (LW). The HPRT cDNA of patient
DM contained a duplication of exon 2 and 3 resulting in the
addition of a predicted 96 amino acids to the aminoKerminal part
of the protein. In the second group we identified one instance
of an inframe insertion of three nucleotides in the HPRT gene
that gave rise to an extra Ala after amino acid 142 (RW) while
in the HPRT gene of patient AA there were two missense
mutations occurring two nucleotides apart changing Met-43 into
Arg and Asp-44 into Asn. This HPRT variant was designated
HPRTsahunanc,; The pedigree included several affected members
represented by AA. Studies of available family members indicated
the mother and sister to be carriers of the same double mutation,
while the father and a maternal uncle had HPRT cDNA sequences
without these changes (figure 1).
Partial HPRT deficiency with hyperuricemia and its clinical
consequences as the only manifestation of disease occurs when
HPRT enzyme activity in the intact cell fibroblast assay is in the
range of 8 to 60% of normal. HPRT cDNA from nine such
individuals was characterized. In seven a single nucleotide change
was found leading to amino acid substitution in the HPRT protein.
In patients DD and AG this was the replacement of Arg-48 by
His. In JS there was a substitution of Trp for Cys at residue 23.
Patients TE and MG both had mutations affecting the codon for
Val-53; it was changed to Met in TE and to Ala in MG. In patient
JF Thr was substituted for He at residue 183 and in patient RB
an Asn replaced Asp at amino acid position 201.
DNA sequence analysis of HPRT cDNA clones isolated from
a patient with hyperuricemia (TL) identified two different

Figure 1. Automated DNA sequence of PCR-amplified HPRT cDNA, as described in the text. The bottom three panels 1, 3 and 7, show the DNA sequence analyses
obtained from the samples of AA's mother (MA), AA and AA's maternal uncle (UA), respectively. Only the interval between nucleotides 119 and 142 of the HPRT
cDNA is shown. Nucleotide differences as compared to normal are indicated by arrows. Two different HPRT cDNA clones were present in the samples from the
mother, in one the DNA sequence was identical to normal whereas in the other (shown here) the same changes were found as in AA. This identifies her as a carrier.
In the top part of figure 1 comparisons between normal and mutant HPRT cDNA and deduced HPRT amino acid sequences are made. A slash indicates that a
comparison to the normal sequence has been made and positions exhibiting differences are indicated by an asterisk. The one-letter amino acid code is used.

transcripts that contained insertions, of 48 and 116 nucleotides
respectively. Both insertions were located between the coding
regions for exon 5 and exon 6. The 48 bp insert was inframe
and thus an addition of 16 new amino acids to the HPRT protein
was predicted. The 116 bp insertion resulted in a frameshift and
premature stop codon after 87 bp. Examination of the established
complete nucleotide sequence of the human HPRT gene (20) and
comparing it with the two inserted sequences indicated that they
correspond to segments of intervening sequence 5 (TVS 5) of the
normal HPRT gene. Each inserted sequence is preceded in the
genomic DNA by the dinucleotide AG. Both insertions end at
exactly the same position and immediately precede the
dinucleotide AT in the genomic HPRT DNA. Most eukaryotic
exons are flanked by the dinucleotides AG at the 3' end and GT
at the 5' end. An A to G transition occurring in the genomic
DNA at the position immediately following the 5' end of the
inserted sequences would create a 5' splice site. Since both
sequences are preceded by cryptic 3' splice sites, the molecular
prerequisites for additional exons could be fulfilled by such an
A to G mutation. To this end, genomic DNA from patient TL
was used to PCR-amplify a 261 bp fragment (primers 2217/2219)
spanning the region of interest from FVS 5 of the HPRT gene.

After a second, asymmetric PCR amplification step the DNA
was directly sequenced in the dideoxy reaction. The DNA from
patient TL carried the predicted A to G transition.
Fibroblasts isolated from another hyperuricemic patient (MiG)
produced two types of transcripts; one correctly spliced HPRT
mRNA and one in which a downstream cryptic 3' splice site in
exon 6 was utilized. This led to the removal of the first 49
nucleotides of exon 6 and a truncated protein with premature
termination of translation. Direct DNA sequence analysis of a
PCR-amplified, 322 bp fragment (primers 2483/2484) spanning
the 3' splice site of exon 6 failed to reveal any changes as
compared to normal within 100 bases immediately upstream of
exon 6.
DISCUSSION

We identified 22 independent mutations in the HPRT gene, 14
of which were derived from patients with partial HPRT
deficiency, with the objective of exploring a possible correlation
between phenotype and genotype.
We found molecular evidence of genetic heterogeneity
underlying the different forms of partial HPRT deficiency.

430 Human Molecular Genetics, Vol. 1, No. 6
Missense mutations were the most common cause of the genetic
alterations but instances of duplication and insertion were found
as well. A preferential clustering of these missense mutations
to the amino-terminal part of the molecule was observed. Of the
patients with mutations in exon one and two, only one (FG) had
a Lesch —Nyhan phenotype and this patient's enzyme permitted
very different behavior of cultured cells in a selective media than
classic Lesch —Nyhan cells as well as some expression in the
erythrocytes of a carrier (30). Also, missense mutations associated
with partial HPRT deficiency often involved a conservative amino
acid replacement in the HPRT protein in contrast to those found
in patients with the classic Lesch -Nyhan phenotype. The aminoterminal clustering probably reflects functional areas of the protein
that are of less importance for catalytic activity. Future studies
may reveal whether the observed characteristics in location and
type of DNA-sequence alteration associated with partial HPRT
deficiency are distinct enough to permit their use as a prognostic
factor to predict outcome of the disease in a newly diagnosed
patient. Residual enzyme activity as measured in the intact cell
assay (5) is in our opinion still the method of choice for these
type of analyses.
When examining the entire pool of independent point mutations
reported so far in the HPRT gene, they appear to be fairly evenly
spread along the HPRT coding region. However, a certain degree
of clustering to a small region of exon three and exon five was
noted by Tarle et al (15). This could reflect a genetic phenomenon
or be due to an ascertainment bias where mutations producing
a clinically apparent phenotype would be picked up more
frequently than silent mutations with no negative effect on enzyme
activity. However, no neutral polymorphism has so far been
observed in the HPRT coding region. To date the entire coding
region for more than 75 patients with HPRT deficiency has been
sequenced. In no instance, except for one patient described here
(AA, HPRTsgja,,,,,,^, has more than a single mutational event
been observed. In addition we have sequenced HPRT cDNA
isolated from 5 normal individuals and found no amino acid
change. In HPRTsaJamanc two missense mutations were found
one nucleotide apart leading to amino acid changes at residue
43 and 44. The K,,, value for hypoxanthine was 40 /*M, with
a normal value of 13 /*M. At this point it is not clear whether
both amino acid replacements affect the decrease in substrate
affinity although it is reasonable to assume since both represent
non-conservative substitutions. No point mutation has previously
been reported in the codon for amino acid 43 or 44.
The clustering of mutations reported by Tarle et al probably
has a genetic basis and may in part be explained by the location
of a CpG mutational hot spot in exon three: Arg-51 contained
an identical nonsense mutation (CGA —TGA) in two unrelated
Lesch —Nyhan patients in this study. Among the entire pool of
independent point mutations observed in the HPRT gene the
codon for Arg-51 has been changed 7 times, making it the most
commonly affected amino acid (12% of the point mutations). Five
of these mutational events exhibit a C-to-T transition suggesting
the location of a CpG mutational hot spot, where the deamination
of a methylated C results in a C-to-T or a G-to-A transition (31).
We identified two patients with hyperuricemia who displayed
aberrant HPRT mRNA splicing. In one, (MiG), this had the effect
of a dominant, negative mutation: the HPRT transcripts consisted
of a mixture of normally spliced mRNA and mRNA where a
cryptic 3' splice site in exon 6 was utilized, leading to a truncated
molecule. The resulting enzyme activity was 9% and the K,,, for
hypoxanthine was 27 /tM. This indicates that the abnormal HPRT

on 13 April 2018

polypeptide participates as a subunit in the formation of the
tetrameric enzyme. Sequence analysis of 100 intronic nucleotides
preceding exon 6 did not show any deviation from normal and
it is not yet clear what causes the abnormal splicing in this mutant.
In another hyperuricemic patient (TL), an A-to-G transition
in intron 5 (nucleotide position 32863 as numbered by Edwards
et al) (20) of the HPRT gene led to the creation of a GT
dinucleotide and a functional 5' splice site as evidenced by two
HPRT cDNA transcripts containing novel exon sequences
corresponding to segments of IVS 5. In patient TL isolated
hyperuricemia accompanied a residual HPRT enzyme activity
of approximately 50% as measured in intact fibroblasts. The
HPRT Ko, value for hypoxanthine, measured in the same cells
approximated 18 ^M, which is close to the control value of
approximately 13 /tM. It is difficult to understand how a mutation
leading to either a truncated protein (116 bp insertion) or a protein
containing 16 amino acids inserted after residue 134 of the normal
molecule (48 bp insertion) can result in such high residual enzyme
activity. We unsuccessfully searched a large number of HPRT
cDNA clones derived from TL with the objective of finding
additional transcripts including a correctly spliced molecule. With
at least two aberrant forms of the HPRT subunit synthesized it
is not clear how the normally homotetrameric enzyme is
assembled in this mutant. In vitro studies have shown that under
certain experimental conditions the homodimer of the normal
protein is catalytically active (32). Once a three dimensional
structure is available for HPRT it will be of great interest to see
whether the insertion in this mutant occurred without grossly
disrupting catalytic regions of the molecule.
Although the combined data on mutations in the HPRT gene
point to a higher tolerance, in terms of enzyme function, for
amino acid substitutions in the amino-terminal part of the protein,
it is not possible to draw extended conclusions regarding effects
on the three-dimensional structure until X-ray crystallographic
information on HPRT or a closely related molecule is available.
A three-dimensional prediction model has been created for HPRT
(33). This was based on similarities between secondary structure
predictions for HPRT and NAD binding proteins. The model
for human HPRT was created on the basis of the dinucleotide
fold found in the tertiary structure of many dehydrogenases.
However, secondary structure predictions for mouse HPRT did
not conform to the model (34) and another limitation was the
fact that the C-terminal half of HPRT, a region that contains many
of the most severe mutations, was not taken into account by this
model. The current access to approximately 50 different missense
mutations each with a defined effect on enzyme function makes
the HPRT molecule an attractive candidate for structural studies.
Of particular structural interest will be amino acid 201, an Asp
in the wild-type molecule, which has been change to a different
amino acid in four different patients representing three different
clinical phenotypes: in a Lesch-Nyhan patient (GM) it was
changed to a Tyr, in a neurologic variant with a residual enzyme
activity of approximately 8% a Val was found at position 201
(unpublished data) and in two hyperuricemic individuals (RB,
35) Asn and Gly, respectively, replaced the Asp at position 201.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strategy
Full-length HPRT cDNAs were characterized by DNA sequence analysis.
Automated dideoxynucleotide sequencing was, unless otherwise stated, performed
on PCR-amplified, cloned material. A minimum of two clones were sequenced
from each amplification reaction and two independent PCR-amplifications were

carried out on the cDNA from each patient. Fibroblast cell lines were the source
of mRNA in all instances except for the analyses of AA and MG where EBvirus transformed B-lymphocytes and PHA-stimulated peripheral T-cells,
respectively, were used.
Cell lines
Primary fibroblast cell lines were established from biopsied skin using standard
methods. Cells were grown in Coon's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 2 mM glutamine. The cells were harvested by trypsinization.
B-cell derived cell lines were established by Epstein—Barr virus transformation
of cells isolated from peripheral blood (17). They were maintained in RPMI medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM glutamine. All cell lines
were derived from patients diagnosed in this laboratory. HPRT enzyme activity
was measured in fibroblast cell lines established from each patient using an intact
cell assay (5). K,,, values for hypoxanthine was analyzed as described (18).
PHA-sdmulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes
Lymphocytes were recovered from 10 ml of heparinized blood and incubated
at a concentration of 1-2X10 6 cells per milliliter in RPMI medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine and in the presence
of 2% phytohemagglutinin (HA 15; Wellcome Diagnostics, Research Triangle

cycles. Aliquots of 5 /J of the PCR product were amplified in a second PCR
reaction with asymmetric priming using 0.3 ng of oligonucleotide 2219 or 2284,
40 cycles and otherwise identical conditions as in the first PCR reaction. PCR
products were purified on a Centricon 30 mkroconcentrator (Amicon, Beverly,
MA), dried under vacuum and directly sequenced using Sequenase version 2.0
(USB, Cleveland, OH). In the sequencing reaction 1 jig of oligonucleoude primer
2217 or 2483 were used.

Synthetic oligonucleotides
Oligonucleotidc primers were manufactured on a Gene Assembler (Pharmacia,
Piscataway, NJ) according to the published sequences of HPRT cDNA (L1351,
L1353),(19) and HPRT genomic DNA (2217, 2219, 2483, 2484),(20). Primers
that were used only for PCR amplification were usually deprotected and not purified
any further. An HPLC purification step on a RPC-PEP column (Pharmacia,
Piscataway, NJ) was used for the DNA sequencing primers. Oligonucleotide
primers for automated fluorescent DNA sequencing (SP6, T7; Stratagen, Jolla,
CA) were dye labeled at the 5'terminus by the Aminolink method (21). The

To facilitate subsequent cloning, two EcoRI restriction sites were added to the
5' end of primer L1351 and two Sail restriction sites were built in to the 5' end
of primer L1353.
cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification
Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from cultured cells according to a published protocol
(22). Fibroblasts ( 5 - lOx 106) or lymphoblasts ( 5 - 1 0 x 107) were typically used
for each poly(A)+RNA isolation, yielding 2-5/ig of mRNA. The mRNA, 1-3
/ig was used for single stranded cDNA synthesis (Red Module Kit; Invitrogen,
San Diego, CA) using 1 jig of oligonucleotide primer LI351. The cDNA was
extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in
10 y\ of water Aliquots of 10 jtl were amplified in a total volume of 100 /J
in the PCR using 0.5 jig each of oligonucleotide primers L1351 and L1353.
Additional specific PCR conditions were as follows: 2 mM MgCl2, 2.5 U Taq
polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Emeryville, CA), denaturation at 94° for 1.5
min, annealing 44° for 2 min, extension 71° for 3 min; 25 cycles.
Cloning and automated DNA sequencing
The PCR reaction product was purified on glass beads (Geneclean, BIO 101,
Inc La Jolla, CA), digested with EcoRI and Sail and passed through a Linkers
6 Quick Spin column (Boehringer/Mannh, Indianapolis, IN) before ligation in
the EcoRI/Sall sites of vector pGEM 3Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI). Plasmids,
prepared (23) from JM 101 bacteria transformed with the ligation mixture, were
analyzed by restriction digestion and their inserts, if present, were sequenced.
Both strands were sequenced by dideoxy chain termination on an ABI 370A or
373A DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc. Foster City, CA) using the SP6
and T7 vector primer sequences. Sequences were analyzed on a VAX-VMS version
5.2 computer with the programs of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer
Group (24) or with ABI:s SEQ ED 675 version 1.0.9 (ABI, Foster City, CA).
