This study was done to define clinical features for the different pathological types of advanced gastric carcinoma. One thousand one hundred three
patients were identified and classified into two groups: 479 patients
(43.4%) had a differentiated adenocarcinoma and 624 patients (56.6%)
had an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma. Patients with the undifferentiated
type were more likely to have large invasive tumors and a higher incidence
of peritoneal dissemination. Conversely, the patients with the differentiated type were more likely to have a liver metastasis. Multivariate
analysis, using Cox’ proportional hazard model adjusted for sex, age, and
other factors, suggested that tumor size was one of the seven most
independent prognostic factors in patients with the undifferentiated type
(relative risk = l.Ol), but this parameter lost prognostic value in patients
with the differentiated type. With regard to correlation between survival
time and tumor size, the larger the tumor (over 10 cm), the shorter the
survival time of patients with the undifferentiated type, as compared to
findings in patients with the differentiated type (P < 0.01). Thus,
differences in clinical characteristics, including characteristics in the
individual patients, extent of tumor, distant metastasis, prognostic factors,
and prognosis correlate with the histopathological type of gastric carcinoma.

out multivariate analyses, using Cox’ proportional hazard
model adjusting for sex, age, and other characteristics.
After stratification according to the pathology, the multivariate analysis indicated that gastric wall invasion,
peritoneal dissemination, liver metastasis, operative procedure, operative curability, and lymph node metastasis
were the most important prognostic factors, in both
classes ( P < 0.01 or 0.05). The multivariate analysis
indicated that tumor size was also an independent prognostic factor in patients with the undifferentiated type
(P < 0.01, regression coefficient = 0.050, relative
risk = l.Ol/cm), however tumor size had no prognostic
relevance in patients with the differentiated type of
gastric carcinoma (Table 11).
To examine the relationship between distribution of
survival rates and tumor size, we carried out a univariate
analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method and Mantel-Cox
analysis. The univariate analysis indicated that tumor size
correlated with a decreased survival rate for both differentiated and undifferentiated types (P < 0.01). For tumors smaller than 10 cm, the distributions were similar
for both differentiated and undifferentiated types
( P > 0.1) (Fig. la, b). For tumors larger than 10 cm, the
survival time for patients with the undifferentiated type
was significantly less than for that of the differentiated
type ( P < 0.01). The cumulative survival rate at 5 years
was 24.5% for patients with the differentiated type and
only 12.4% for patients with the undifferentiated type of
gastric carcinoma (Fig. lc).

DISCUSSION
Sugano et al. [ l l ] divided gastric carcinoma into
differentiated and undifferentiated types and suggested
that the former arises from the intestinal metaplastic
epithelium, while the latter arises from the ordinary
mucosa. These two types generally correspond, respectively, to intestinal-type carcinoma and diffuse carcinoma by Laurin’s classification and to expanding type
and infiltrative type according to Ming’s classification
[15,16]. Noda et al. [4]reported that the diffuse type
carcinoma was more common in younger individuals and
in women, whereas the intestinal type carcinoma was
more common in aged men. They reported that the

diffuse type was more frequently invasive and extensive
and was associated with peritoneal dissemination,
whereas the intestinal type metastasized more frequently
to the liver. Based on the classification by Sugano et al.
[ l l ] the results agree with the findings of the present
study. Moreover our findings extended the correlation
with size of the tumor and enabled detection of independent prognostic factors in differentiated and undifferentiated types. Thus we have been able to characterize the
two pathological classes of gastric carcinoma by their
clinical features. Maruyama [ 5 ] reported that gastric wall
invasion, lymph node metastasis, gross appearance of
cancer, location, and histological type were the independent prognostic factors in gastric carcinoma. He concluded that tumor size correlated with depth of gastric
wall invasion and lymph node metastasis although the
tumor size did have a close correlation with the prognosis. He reported that tumor size had no independent
prognostic significance after adjusting for other characteristics in the multivariate analysis. Other investigators
did not discuss the prognostic importance of tumor size
[&lo]. We determined prognostic factors in each group
of patients after stratification based on the class of
pathology. The conclusion reached by Maruyama [5]
applied only to the differentiated type of gastric cancer in
the present study. We found that tumor size was clearly
the most independent prognostic factor for patients with
the undifferentiated type of carcinoma. In the undifferentiated type, tumors may be more infiltrative or be more
widespread, independent of the degree of gastric wall
invasion or status of lymph node metastasis. The tumor
size may indeed be closely linked to the prognostic
significance of survival time in the undifferentiated type,
as tumor size correlated closely to the tumor volume or to
the number of malignant cells. Hermanek [6] suggested
that the diffuse type was more extensive throughout the
gastric wall than was the intestinal type. Husemann [17]
advocated that the margin of clearance provided at
gastrectomy be greater for the diffuse type than for the
intestinal type in case of a carcinoma at the stomach
cardia. As survival time for the undifferentiated types
with large tumors was significantly less than that for the
differentiated type, we recommend that a larger margin
of clearance from the tumor edge be provided or that an
extended radical operation be performed for patients with
the undifferentiated type. When a curative operation,
despite aggressive treatment, is not effective for such
patients, then postoperative chemotherapy should be
prescribed given the greater sensitivity of undifferenti-

ated tumors to antitumor drugs [2,3]. As an accurate
analysis of prognostic variables is essential, our analysis
of the prognostic parameters in gastric carcinoma should
aid in making clinical decisions and thus optimize
operative and chemotherapeutic success.
