150 schizoaffective probands and their 1029 first-degree relatives were examined in search of the heterogeneity of the disorder. The sample of probands was split by several criteria. Among the various subgroups the morbidity risk of relatives was analysed as an external criterion for heterogeneity. Female relatives show a higher risk for affective disorders that male relatives. This is true for relatives of male and female index patients. Schizophrenia is equally frequent in male and female relatives. Schizoaffective psychoses take an intermediate position. The further analysis included the following characteristics of the probands: age at first episode, number of episodes, psychopathological subtypes (affective, schizophrenic, undifferentiated: manic, non-manic). None of these criteria proved to distinguish subgroups significantly, therefore, the search for heterogeneity was negative, although some results show a trend to the expected direction.
