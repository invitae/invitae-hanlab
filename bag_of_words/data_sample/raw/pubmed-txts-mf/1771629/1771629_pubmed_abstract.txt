A familial abnormal protein C most probably with the dysfunctional Gla domain was found in a 60-year-old man with recurrent thrombosis. Namely, the anticoagulant activity as measured by the APTT method and the antigen level by an ELISA utilizing a calcium-dependent antibody were reduced to nearly half of normal, 43.5% and 2.1 micrograms/ml (normal range: 2.8-5.0 micrograms/ml), respectively. On the other hand, the amidolytic activity determined on a synthetic chromogenic substrate, S-2366, and the total antigen measured by an ELISA utilizing a polyclonal antibody were both in the normal range, 74.1% and 83% of normal, respectively. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis showed more anodal migration than the normal control in the presence of calcium ions, and adsorption of protein C to barium citrate was insufficient. These data altogether indicated that a half population of protein C in the patient's plasma was dysfunctional in the Gla domain or its related structures. Four other members of his immediate family were found to have the same abnormality of protein C, although they had been all asymptomatic. We thus conclude that the dysfunctional protein C is hereditary, and that the abnormalities noted in several tests are most likely due to a structural defect residing in the Gla or its related regions. We hereby designate this abnormal protein C as protein C Yonago.
