FAMILIAL PAROXYSMAL KINESIGENIC ATAXIA
AND CONTINUOUS MYOKYMIA

(From the Department of Neurology, University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands)

SUMMARY
A large family with paroxysmal ataxia and continuous myokymic discharges is described. The disorder
is of autosomal dominant inheritance. During attacks coordination of movements and balance are disturbed;
often a postural tremor of the head and the hands and fine twitching in some of the facial and hand muscles
are present. The attacks usually last a few minutes and may occur several times per day. They first appear
in childhood and tend to abate after early adulthood. The attacks are frequently precipitated by kinesigenic
stimuli similar to those in paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis. Their occurrence can be reduced or
prevented by carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Between attacks a slight postural tremor and ataxia was found
in a few of the elderly affected members. Fine rippling myokymia was obvious in a few and could be
detected on close inspection in about half of the adults. Electromyography (EMG) showed myokymic
discharges in all affected members. The characteristics and reactivity of this myokymic activity suggest
multiple impulse generation in the peripheral nerves.

INTRODUCTION

Hitherto, 3 families have been described with a remarkable syndrome, combining various
expressions of continuous motor unit activity (CMUA) with paroxysms of ataxia and
shaking or titubation (Van Dyke et al., 1975; Hanson et al., 1977; Gancher and Nutt,
1986). On the one hand it has been compared with the paroxysmal dyskinesias or classified
among the episodic ataxias, on the other hand it has been related to myokymia and
neuromyotonia. The uneasy classification of this syndrome may follow from its
combination of signs of both central and peripheral nervous origin with prominence
of one or the other. The disappearance of the CMUA following curare administration
and its persistence during proximal nerve block point to impulse generation in peripheral
nerves. The pathogenesis of the attacks of disturbed coordination and jerking has not
been demonstrated. We describe a further large family with this syndrome and supply
additional information about the characteristics of the CMUA.

Fig. 1 shows the pedigree. Of the 24 members alive at the onset of this investigation, 22 have been
examined by one of us (E.B.). First hand accounts were obtained of the deceased affected members and
of the 2 living affected members who could not be seen by us (IV-24, V-5). In addition, medical records
were available for one of these (IV-24). Verbatim histories were completed by a written enquiry. For
3 patients spontaneous and induced attacks were documented on film.

FIG. 1. Pedigree. The proband is indicated by an arrow. Those affected members which were examined personally
are marked by an X.

Case V-15
The proband was a 6-yr-old boy when first seen in 1983. The first attacks were noticed at the age of
4 yrs. During an attack his gait became unsteady with buckling at the knees; his arm and hand movements
were clumsy and his speech became slurred. Shaking of his head, body and limbs was sometimes observed.
Trembling of facial muscles was not noticed. The onset of the attacks was sudden and heralded by a poorly
localized uncomfortable feeling. His limbs felt limp or 'tired'. Consciousness remained unaltered and there
was no vertigo. Except for some accompanying nausea, autonomic manifestations were absent; there was
no headache after an attack. The attacks varied in intensity and usually lasted 3—5 min with a range of
0.5 — 10 min. The frequency of occurrence varied from once in 3 wks to more than 15 per day. Attacks
could occur without a clear precipitation but happened mostly during physical exertion, especially in
combination with startle or apprehension. Several attacks occurred, for example, during bicycle competitions
in situations of potential collision when the patient had suddenly to alter course to avoid falling.
Neurological examination. Between attacks, saccadic and pursuit eye movements were normal, without
nystagmus. Coordination of axial and limb movements, muscle strength, sensation and tendon reflexes
were also normal. There was no resting or postural tremor. When at a later stage special attention was
given to its presence, myokymia was not visible but could be deduced from small lateral finger movements
when the hands were held in a relaxed prone position. The presence of myokymic activity was later confirmed
by EMG examination.
Witnessed attack. At our request an attack was provoked by his father, who let his son run upstairs
several times and then startled him by seizing an ankle. When we saw him half a minute after the onset,
he showed a wide-based gait and swayed to keep his balance. He was unable to stand on one leg and his
arm movements were imprecise. His speech was not obviously affected. Tendon reflexes and muscle strength
were normal and there was no tremor, nystagmus or autonomic disturbance. The signs diminished gradually
and had disappeared after 3 min.
Treatment and follow-up. Clonazepam in a daily dose of 1.2—1.5 mg did not alter the occurrence of
attacks. During treatment with sulthiame, the attack rate was approximately halved at a daily dose of 200 mg.

During this treatment very short or abortive attacks were noticed, consisting of a sudden sensation of stiffness
or limpness in his body, not followed by a disturbance of movement. The treatment with sulthiame has
been continued for about 1 yr without a clear loss of effectiveness. Side effects caused by sulthiame were
paraesthesiae, intermittent stiffness in his hands and fatigue. The paraesthesiae could be reduced by oral
potassium chloride suppletion.
Case 1V-22
The mother of the proband, was 25 yrs old when examined in 1983. She had been affected by the attacks
since the age of 3 yrs. The onset of the attacks was sudden and marked by a 'click' in the head. In a
few seconds this was followed by a sensation of heaviness, slowness and weakness, which could start either
in her head or in her legs and involved the rest of her body in a matter of seconds. At the end of an attack,
this sensation at times remained longer either in her hands or her feet but it always began and ceased
symmetrically. Some attacks were accompanied by a feeling of stiffness in her face or hands. Severe attacks
were characterized by trembling in the muscles around her eyes and mouth and trembling or shaking of
her legs, hands and body. Relaxation could diminish the shaking. Together with this sensation of weakness
and with the trembling there was a more or less profound loss of control of directed movements. Her
gait was unsteady, sometimes resulting in falls, arm movements were incoordinated and her speech was
dysarthric, as if she were drunk or had a swollen tongue. Her eye movements felt impeded; the eyes were
staring and her vision was blurred, sometimes with a suggestion of double vision. Vertigo, oscillopsia
or autonomic symptoms were absent. Minor attacks often remained unnoticed by others. The attacks usually
lasted 0.5—2 min with a range of several seconds to about 10 min. After the onset the intensity increased
over 10—20 s and at the termination diminished more gradually. Their frequency varied from once in
several weeks to more than 10 in one day and declined after her twentieth year. During her 2 pregnancies,
attacks had occurred infrequently. The attacks could occur spontaneously but were usually brought about
by an abrupt movement following rest, for instance jumping out of bed, or by a change in speed or direction
of a movement involving her body, such as forceful braking while cycling. Attacks occurred more easily
when she was startled or nervous. At school she often had attacks during gymnastics when jumping or
running and she was teased by her classmates who had discovered that she would have an attack when
they chased her. Attacks could be avoided by rising deliberately and slowly from sitting. To shorten an
attack she ritually applied cold water to her wrists. She had had several cycle accidents and once nearly
drowned because of an attack.
Examination. Eye movements and coordination were normal. There was no nystagmus and no resting
or postural tremor. At the initial examination myokymia was not noticed. When special attention was paid
to this at a later date myokymia could be observed as fine skin rippling and could be deduced from small
irregular finger movements when her hands were held prone and relaxed. The myokymic rippling was
enhanced for several minutes following 3 min of forearm ischaemia. At EMG examination myokymic
discharges were found in many muscles, including clinically silent ones.
Treatment and follow-up. Drug treatment with clomipramine, 75 mg per day for 3 wks, and phenytoin
200 mg per day for 1 month, had no clear effect. Sulthiame has been effective and has been continued
with some interruptions for 2 yrs, at a dose of 50—200 mg daily. During this treatment, abortive attacks
were still noticed rather frequently, lasting only a few seconds and consisted of the characteristic sensation
without the ensuing ataxia. Troublesome side effects were paraesthesiae and intermittent carpal spasm.
Case IU-25
A 59-yr-old woman when examined in 1983. She suffered attacks from the age of 7 yrs. The frequency
was highest at about the age of 50 yrs, following hysterectomy. Since then, the attack rate had fallen from
once a month to about once in 3 months. Attacks were either short, lasting about 15 min, or prolonged,
persisting for 5 - 7 h. The onset was marked by a shock-like sensation in her head, followed by a limp,
stiff or trembling sensation which spread to her arms and legs. The persistence of this feeling in her legs
after 15 min usually indicated a prolonged attack. During an attack her movements were hampered and
imprecise, her gait was staggering and her speech was slurred. Often there was tremor of her head and
sometimes her vision was blurred. Vertigo or nausea never occurred. She had noticed that sometimes her
hands were somewhat bluish and swollen before an attack and slender and white afterwards. During a

prolonged attack her mouth became dry and following an attack she noticed urinary frequency. She found
that the best way to cope with an attack was to avoid movements and to sleep; after a few hours of sleep
a long attack had usually terminated.
The attacks could occur spontaneously but were also brought about by movement. Occasionally an attack
occurred at night and was noticed when she awoke. At a young age most of the attacks happened at weekends
and when relaxing. She felt that activity to some extent prevented the attacks. Susceptibility seemed to
be increased during illness, during seasonal changes and when she felt tired or stressed. Prevention was
usually sought by thoughtful, slow execution of movements. In a waiting room she would, for instance,
choose a place where she would not have to turn around when called.
Examination. There was no tremor or nystagmus and coordination was normal. Rippling of the skin
was visible in the small hand muscles, and at subsequent visits sometimes noticed in her forearms and
around her mouth and eyes. In her face the rippling was reminiscent of 'live flesh' and in the larger muscles
it was comparable to benign fasciculation. Apparently due to myokymia, the thumbs were held slightly
in adduction-opposition. On EMG, myokymic activity was found in face, arms and legs, most pronounced
in the distal parts.
Witnessed attack. On one occasion, we had the opportunity of examining her at home during a prolonged
attack. She had alerted us when the 'limp-stiff feeling in her legs persisted and we arrived about 1 h after
the onset. From the onset the intensity had fluctuated without symptom-free intervals. Speaking and movement
caused an increase of the symptoms. The myokymia was not obviously increased. Respiration was somewhat
deepened and her speech was slow and a little hesitant. Her gait was broad-based with short unequal steps
and was performed in a slow rhythm. Tandem walking was impossible. Performance of alternating
movements with her tongue, hands and feet was slow and imprecise. The heel/shin test showed moderate
ataxia and the finger/nose test was performed slowly. The recoil sign of Gordon Holmes and hypermetria
were absent. Tendon reflexes and resistance to passive movement were normal. There was no nystagmus.
When searching in her handbag for tablets, her movements were clumsy and imprecise, discrete finger
movements being poor. There was a marked 3 —4 Hz rotatory postural tremor of the head and a fine postural
tremor of the hands, both disappearing on complete relaxation.
Treatment and follow-up. Two carbonic anhydrase inhibiting drugs have been tried to prevent attacks:
acetazolamide 250-500 mg daily and diclofenamide 50 mg per day. Paraesthesiae and stiffening of the
hands caused both drugs to be stopped after a few days; 200 mg sulthiame, taken once during a long attack,
appeared to shorten the attack but caused paraesthesiae which lasted 1 wk. During a short course of phenytoin,
with a blood level of 5.5 /ig one attack occurred which she felt was milder than usual; her speech was
not slurred, the tremor was absent and she was able to walk reasonably well.

RESULTS

From the different case histories the following pattern of attacks emerges (see Appendix
1). The attacks usually commence between the fifth and seventh years of life. The onset
is sudden and, in about half of the patients, marked by a click or shock. Within a few
seconds this is followed by a diffuse evolving or spreading sensation of stiffness or
limpness, causing awareness of an attack without the occurrence of actual movement.
The intensity peaks in a matter of seconds and subsequently declines gradually over
several minutes. In addition to the characteristic incoordination, most patients notice
trembling of the face, head or limbs and many report visual blurring and staring of
the eyes. A minority report a feeling of warmth or increased perspiration. Nausea or
rotatory vertigo and involuntary jerking or writhing movements are absent. The 3 patients
who also suffer from epilepsy easily discriminate the two kinds of attack. Attacks vary
in severity and duration and may pass unnoticed when minor. During an attack most
patients stand still or sit down but some can continue walking. Writing or eating is usually

impossible. When an attack occurs while cycling most patients dismount quickly; some
are unable to do so and have to fall in order to prevent an accident.
The duration of the attacks is usually between a few seconds and about 10 min,
extending up to 6 h in a few individuals. The attacks tend to be shorter in childhood.
An attack is rarely repeated within 1 h (111-34). The frequency tends to be highest in
the first and second decades and shows a rather large variation within and between
individuals, ranging from more than 15 a day to less than 1 per month. Some of the
elderly patients have attacks as infrequently as once every 2 or 3 yrs.
Attacks can occur spontaneously but are usually brought on by a sudden or unexpected
movement. Typical examples mentioned are rising from a chair, getting up and
subsequently descending from a bus, performing gymnastics or sport, running, sliding,
turning, dancing and sitting in a roundabout. Anxiety and startle enhance the susceptibility,
for example as may happen when appearing in front of the class at school, when getting
up to answer the telephone or to enter a doctor's office. During illness, attacks occur
more often; one boy (V-12) for many years had attacks exclusively during intercurrent
infections. Fatigue and emotional upset are regarded as additional risk factors by half
of the patients. Hunger, lack of sleep or the use of alcohol do not enhance the
susceptibility. During pregnancy the frequency is often reduced, while an incresae
premenstrually was mentioned by 3 patients (IV-15, IV-17, V-3). As can be understood,
prevention of attacks is in the first place attempted by avoidance of gymnastics, sport
and sudden movements. One patient for instance used to wait standing next to the
physician's door. Alleviation or shortening of an attack is sought by sitting or lying
down and by avoidance of movement. Habitually several patients apply a cold flannel
to their face or hands or keep their hands in cold running water. Patients suffering from
prolonged attacks try to sleep.
Examination and witnessed attacks
Clinical neurological data during symptom-free periods and during attacks are presented
in Appendix 2. The loss of coordination observed in about half of the elderly patients
was slight to moderate with an intention tremor in the finger/nose test in 2 of them.
The postural tremor of the head or outstretched hands found in a minority of the elderly
patients was subtle and the slight resting tremor of the hands was seen in the patient
with the most pronounced myokymia (111-33). Nystagmus was occasionally observed
in 1 patient only, who was on anticonvulsants (111-26).
Myokymia was obvious in the hands in 4 elderly patients only. However, on careful
inspection about half of the patients showed more or less constant fine skin rippling
and in another quarter, myokymia could be deduced from minute lateral finger
movements, with the hand held in a relaxed prone position. Most of the patients had
not previously noticed the muscular twitching, but the peculiar position of the thumb
was known to some and referred to as 'vicar's hands'.
We witnessed 14 attacks occurring in 9 patients. In addition, a neurological description
was available for 1 patient of what probably was a prolonged attack (IV-9). Eight attacks
were purposely provoked, 4 occurred on entering the office and 2 began spontaneously.
As a provocation we asked the patients to rise quickly after a loud handclap, sometimes
followed by turning around or by hopping, or to run up a staircase quickly. Only a
minority of the attempts was successful. The disturbance of coordination and the tremor

started a few seconds after the provocation, reaching a peak after 20—30 s and declining
gradually over several minutes. Renewed provocation could enhance a minor attack
shortly after its onset but remained ineffective once the attack had terminated.
All attacks were characterized by ataxia with a broad-based gait, a disturbance of
limb coordination and a reduced speed of alternating movements. Usually tandem walking
and balancing on one leg were impossible. Often a more or less pronounced postural
tremor of the arms and head was present and in one instance a tremor of the head was
combined with a subtle lateral tremor of the mandible (III-9). Dysarthria, noticed in
the majority of the attacks, was characterized by a reduced word fluency and an obstructed
rather than a hypotonic speech. In about half of the witnessed attacks myokymia appeared
to be increased, mainly in the face, and in 1 case the adduction-opposition position of
the thumb was more pronounced. Hyperreflexia with flexor plantar reflexes was found
in 2 patients. Nystagmus, athetosis, dystonia or chorea were absent and there was no
deficit of muscle power.
Investigations (see Appendix 3)
Three of the 4 abnormal EEGs were compatible with the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy
(111-26, IV-13, IV-24). In the 1 case without epilepsy, the EEG showed paroxysmal
events. Contingent negative variation in 4 patients was recorded using the S1-S2 paradigm.
A normal CT brain scan was obtained in the patient with the most marked interval ataxia
and tremor (111-33). An MRI brain scan was performed in the oldest affected family
member (111-29), with special attention being paid to the cerebellar vermis; this showed
no abnormality. A postmortem examination was performed in 1 patient (111-29) who
died from a pontine haemorrhage. Examination of the brain and biopsies of a femoral
nerve and an extensor digitorum brevis muscle showed no abnormalities.
Electromyography
Nineteen affected and 3 healthy members have been examined electromyographically,
using both concentric needle and surface electrodes. The 3 healthy subjects showed no
resting EMG activity. In contrast, spontaneously occurring motor unit activity, ranging
from single units to an intermediate interference pattern, was present in all affected
members. It was found most easily in hand muscles, but at times also in proximal limb
muscles and occasionally in the face. Spontaneous motor unit activity was often
encountered in muscles that lacked visible myokymia. Most discharges were regularly
repeated duplets or triplets but singlets and multiplets were also seen frequently (fig. 2).
In addition to rhythmic activity, more or less irregularly repeated single or grouped
potentials occurred.
When occurring rhythmically, the discharges showed a constant rate and independence
of the firing of other discharges recorded at the same site. The basic ('burst') discharge
frequency varied between 0.5 and 8 Hz and was often in the range of 2 — 5 Hz. A
compensatory increase in burst interval could sometimes be seen in complexes with
a variable number of spikes. The length of the series built out of these rhythmic discharges
varied from a few seconds to many hours, outlasting the period of examination. Sometimes
identical activity was found in the same place following an interval of several weeks.
The amplitude of the spontaneously occurring potentials seemed relatively small, about
100—500 fiV on needle electrode recording. The duration of the bursts ranged from

about 5 ms for singlets to more than 25 ms for multiplets. Within the bursts, the spike
frequency ranged between 20 and 250 Hz, the lower frequencies occurring in extended
duplets. The shape of the separate spikes were usually biphasic or triphasic. True
polyphasic spike potentials were not recorded but sometimes the bursts consisted of
irregular nonidentical potentials. In some duplets and multiplets, variably present small
'shadow' potentials could be recognized following a larger, normal spike (fig. 3A).
Another possibility for dissimilarity of repetitive complexes was a variation in amplitude
of one of the spikes (fig. 3B). In addition to spontaneous occurrence, duplets and multiplets
were occasionally recruited during voluntary contraction.

Reactivity of the spontaneous (myokymic) muscle activity
The resting activity was not inhibited by antagonist contraction but could be suppressed
for 5—20 s by a short volitional contraction of the same muscle. Supramaximal nerve
stimulation partially supressed the activity for 100—200 ms. The spontaneous activity
in a hand muscle could be increased by heating and decreased by cooling the forearm,
with a slight reduction of the burst frequency.
The intravenous administration of 1 g of ionized calcium, investigated in 2 patients,
produced a slight to moderate diminution of resting activity and reduced the post-ischaemic
recruitment. Hyperventilation caused a moderate rise in burst frequency and less
consistently an increase in the number of spikes per burst and recruitment of new bursts.
In 2 patients, spontaneous activity in the hypothenar muscle disappeared completely

when the ulnar nerve was blocked by local anaesthetic at the wrist while only about
half of the discharges were abolished by anaesthesia at the level of the elbow.
During treatment with acetazolamide and sulthiame, the myokymic activity was
enhanced both by enlargement of existing complexes and by recruitment of new ones.
Using an inflated sphygmomanometer, in 14 patients the influence of limb ischaemia
for up to 15 min was investigated (fig. 4). After 5 — 10 min of ischaemia, the spontaneous
discharges disappeared, either with a gradual decay in amplitude or more suddenly with
an interruption of their rhythmic occurrence. Sometimes an increase of spontaneous
activity was observed during the first few minutes of ischaemia, in 1 instance accompanied
by a positive Trousseau sign. In some discharges we found a remarkable rise in the
burst frequency to about 2—2.5 times its original level after 0 . 5 - 2 min of ischaemia.
About a quarter of the complexes recorded from hand muscles showed this reaction
when the cuff was applied around the upper arm. When the cuff was applied around
the forearm, about 1 in 10—20 complexes reacted in this way. This reaction persisted
when repeated up to 6 times and for a certain complex under identical circumstances,
it remained unchanged even after an interval of several weeks. Some complexes showed
a rise in frequency during ischaemia at the upper arm level but not when the cuff was
inflated around the forearm (fig. 5). When a rise in burst frequency occurred during
ischaemia, after release of the cuff the frequency fell sharply, sometimes with a temporary
disappearance of the discharge, followed by a more gradual rise to the preischaemic
level. On the other hand, when the burst frequency was unaltered during ischaemia,
it would remain so after reversal of the ischaemia.

Depending on its duration, ischaemia was followed by a smaller or larger temporary
increase of spontaneous activity. This increase was due to recruitment of new, sometimes
large, complexes and to enlargement of preexisting complexes with extra spikes (fig. 4).
This excess of activity began 0.5-1 min after reversal of ischaemia, reached a maximum
at 2 — 5 min and gradually declined over 1 0 - 1 5 min.

Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities and distal motor latencies were normal.
The muscle fibre conduction velocity, measured with surface electrodes at the biceps
brachii muscle in 1 patient, was also normal. Comparing the stimulus thresholds of
rectangular and triangular pulses, a normal nerve accommodation was found in 2 patients.
When the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) was recorded with surface
electrodes from the thenar or hypothenar eminences following supramaximal stimulation
at the wrist, in about half of the experiments the CMAP was followed by a small potential
with an amplitude of about a third or less of the CMAP amplitude (fig. 6). This
afterpotential was suppressed during ischaemia and repetitive following ischaemia. Using
twin stimuli with a variable interval between 5 and 500 ms, a comparable recovery
cycle of this afterpotential was found in 4 patients (fig. 7). It was suppressed at stimulus
intervals up to 30 ms, recovered at intervals between 30 and 60 ms and showed an

interval. At this peak, the amplitude of the second afterpotential was 1.5—2 times the
amplitude of the first afterpotential.
Therapy
Various drugs have been tried in an attempt to prevent attacks of ataxia in this family
(Appendix 3). Phenobarbitone and carbamazepine were ineffective. In 1 patient (IV-24),
phenobarbitone effectively prevented epileptic seizures while the attacks of ataxia
continued. Phenytoin in a daily dose of 200-325 mg had little or no effect upon the
attack frequency. Betahistine, cinnarizine, flunarizine, clomipramine and clonazepam,
given to a few patients, did not clearly prevent attacks.
Acetazolamide, initially tried in analogy with its effect in familial periodic ataxia (Griggs
et al., 1978), has been used by 12 patients in dosages ranging from 62 to 750 mg per
day. In 3 patients who stopped this medication within 1 month because of side effects,
the effect could not be evaluated. In the others it has been continued for 2 - 5 2 months
with a mean of 18 months; in 1 patient it had no clear effect, 4 showed a reduction
of the attack rate by more than 50% and 4 were almost free of attacks (less than 1 attack
per month). The suppressive effect of acetazolamide started within 2 days and continued
for 1—3 days after cessation. Sometimes a remarkable lasting improvement followed
prolonged treatment with this drug. Both the suppressive effect and the side effects were
dose related. The latter consisted of paraesthesiae, muscle stiffening and easy fatiguability
and could be partly reduced by potassium chloride supplementation. Of the other carbonic
anhydrase inhibiting drugs, diclophenamide caused even stronger side effects and could
not be evaluated. Sulthiame, a drug that has also been used successfully in familial periodic

ataxia (Wolf, 1980), caused less side effects and became the preferred drug in most
patients. Twelve of them have used this drug in dosages between 50 and 300 mg daily.
The effectiveness equalled that of acetazolamide and showed little or no reduction when
it was used for more than 3 years. Some patients developed the habit of using the drug
only occasionally, for example, a few hours before sporting activities.
DISCUSSION

The mode of inheritance of the trait in this family is autosomal dominant. Excluding
a twin who died in infancy, of the 56 members at risk of inheriting the trait, 27 were
affected, indicating a relative risk of 48%. As might be expected in a large family,
the attacks showed some interindividual variation with regard to symptoms, duration
and intensity. Between the attacks minor signs of ataxia and postural tremor were present
in some of the older members. Myokymia, which was present in all affected members
on EMG, varied in its clinical expression from invisible to skin rippling and an increased
opposition of the thumb.
In Appendix 4, data from the 3 previously described families with myokymia and
paroxysmal ataxia (HMPA) and of the family described by us are summarized. The
age of onset, frequency, duration and kinesigenic provocation of the attacks of ataxia
seem to a large extent comparable. The presence of jerking during the attacks and the
intensity of myokymia both during and between the attacks may indicate quantitative
differences. Other differences are suggested with regard to the presence of contractures
in early life and the reaction to phenytoin and possibly also to acetazolamide both for
the attacks of ataxia and the myokymia. The results of muscle and nerve biopsies show
divergence.
In other families with HMPA, the resting muscle activity is described as continuous
motor unit activity (CMUA) and as repetitive single or grouped discharges. In the 2
families in which rhythmic occurrence of this activity is apparent, it has been compared
with neuromyotonia. This is in accordance with the characteristic EMG pattern found
by us, consisting of rhythmically repeated duplets and multiplets and which is known
as myokymic or neuromyotonic activity (Andermann et al., 1961; Hjorth and Willison,
1973; Albers et al., 1981; Bergmans, 1982).
It appears that while on the one hand this EMG pattern occurs in various clinical
syndromes such as myokymia, neuromyotonia and familial CMUA of peripheral origin,
on the other hand both in myokymia and neuromyotonia various other EMG patterns
have been described. In neuromyotonia the occurrence of bursts is often less rhythmic
and in myokymia, in addition to rhythmically occurring duplets and multiplets, short
and long bursts that occur irregularly and single action potentials that occur rhythmically
or semirhythmically have been described (Denny-Brown and Foley, 1948; Gamstorp
and Wohlfart, 1959; Isaacs, 1961; Liitsch etai, 1965; Mertens and Zschocke, 1965;
Gardner-Medwin and Walton, 1969; Hughes and Matthews, 1969; Ashizawa et al.,
1983).
In our family, we also found rhythmically or semirhythmically occurring single action
potentials and irregularly occurring multiplets in addition to the characteristic myokymic
discharges. The range of spike frequency is extended beyond 60 Hz, a limit set up by
some for myokymic discharges (AAEE Glossary, 1987). However, myokymic discharges

with a high spike frequency have also been described in other syndromes with myokymia,
both familial and nonfamilial (Mertens and Zschocke, 1965; Albers etal., 1981; Auger
etal, 1984).
The clinical manifestations of the spontaneous muscle activity mentioned in the other
families with HMPA, possibly including postnatal contractures, also fit within the range
that extends from localized fascicular twitching to generalized stiffness which is
encountered in myokymia or neuromyotonia (Isaacs, 1961; Rovetta, 1970; Liitsch et
al., 1978; Coers et al, 1981; McGuire et al, 1984).
Although data are largely incomplete and a variety of aetiologies may exist, many
of the characteristics of the CMUA in our family are comparable with those in
neuromyotonia and related syndromes. The recruitment of duplets, and triplets on volition,
mentioned in 1 other family with HMPA and occasionally observed by us, may be
comparable to the repetitive discharges on volition observed in neuromyotonia. Similarly,
a short suppression of the CMUA after volition has also been described in neuromyotonia
(Stalberg and Trontelj, 1982). The very short suppression of the CMUA following
nerve stimulation which we observed, has been reported in familial and nonfamilial
examples of CMUA of peripheral origin (Sakai et al., 1983; Auger et al., 1984).
The reduction of myokymic activity by administration of calcium in our patients may
be less pronounced than reported in cases of symptomatic myokymia and familial CMUA
of peripheral origin, but the increase after hyperventilation seems comparable (Brick
et al., 1982; Auger et al., 1984). A decrease of the burst frequency during cooling
as we have found has also been reported in familial CMUA of peripheral origin (Auger
et al., 1984).
The reaction of the CMUA to ischaemia is not mentioned in the other families with
HMPA. In nonfamilial and familial cases of CMUA of peripheral origin, a reduction
of amplitude and a decrease in numbers of bursts, burst frequency and number of spikes
per burst have been described (Albers et al., 1981; Auger et al., 1984). A rise in the
burst frequency during ischaemia as sometimes observed in the present family has not
to our knowledge been described before.
The increase in CMUA during treatment with carbonic anhydrase inhibiting drugs,
observed in our family, is at variance with a reduction in resting muscle activity by
acetazolamide in cases of neuromyotonia (Mertens and Zschocke, 1965). While the resting
muscle activity in the nonfamilial and familial varieties of CMUA of peripheral origin
is usually reduced by phenytoin, in only 1 of the families with HMPA has a similar
effect been observed.
In myokymia, neuromyotonia and hereditary CMUA of peripheral origin, the
generation of the resting muscle activity has been localized in distal, proximal or in
combined parts of the peripheral nerves (Isaacs, 1961; Mertens and Zschocke, 1965;
Hughes and Matthews, 1969; Rovetta, 1970; Irani et al., 1977; Lutsch etal., 1978).
In the family described by us, arguments to localize the origin (burst generation) of
the distally-recorded CMUA in the peripheral nerves are (1) disappearance after distal
and partial disappearance after proximal nerve block, (2) relation between a change
in burst frequency during ischaemia and the level of application of the cuff, (3) increase
of CMUA following limb ischaemia and (4) alteration of the CMUA induced by a change
of temperature applied peripherally. Of other families with HMPA a peripheral neuronal
genesis of the resting muscle activity is assumed from histological findings of neuropathy

in one and from the findings of a peripheral nerve block and a curare test in another.
In neuromyotonia the possibility of more than one trigger point along a nerve has
been suggested. In the present family a second or third order impulse generation which
is different from the primary or burst frequency generation is suggested by (1) the variable
presence of small shadow potentials, (2) the independent variation during and after
ischaemia of the burst frequency on the one hand and the spike frequency and number
of spikes per burst on the other hand and (3) the fact that there is not always a
compensatory increase or decrease in burst interval in case of a variable number of
spikes per burst. It is conceivable that a second order impulse generation in the nerve
is also responsible for the afterpotential at nerve stimulation. This phenomenon has also
been described in neuromyotonia and familial CMUA of peripheral origin (Mertens
and Zschocke, 1965; Bergmans, 1982; Auger et al., 1984). In our family, the recovery
cycle of this after discharge with double stimulation, however, appears to be shorter
than has been found in neuromyotonia (Bergmans, 1982). Thus while the various clinical
and EMG manifestations of HMPA can be classified within the spectrum of myokymia
or neuromyotonia and CMUA of peripheral origin, many similarities exist also with
regard to the characteristics of the CMUA, including arguments for a peripheral neuronal
generation. In myokymia or neuromyotonia a pathophysiological mechanism has not
been defined.
Comparing the data from our family with those of paroxysmal kinesigenic
choreathetosis (PKC), a remarkable similarity can be observed for the kinesigenic stimuli
and for the accompanying sensation of stiffness or tense feeling, while some of the
characteristics of the attacks such as duration, frequency, age of onset, the tendency
to abate in adulthood, are comparable. The favourable reaction to antiepileptic drugs,
as in PKC, has not been found by us, but has been seen in 2 of the other families with
HMPA. An abnormality in the contingent negative variation, as reported by some in
patients with PKC (Franssen et al., 1983; Busard et al., 1984), was absent in our family.
With regard to its pathophysiological background, PKC was initially considered to be
an epileptic manifestation (Lishman et al., 1962), but later has been classified as a
subgroup of paroxysmal choreoathetosis (Kertesz, 1967). A reasonable consensus exists
as to involvement of the basal ganglia but, as in HMPA, a consistent structural or
metabolic abnormality has not been found (Lance, 1977; Goodenough etal., 1978; Boel
and Casaer, 1984).
Familial periodic or intermittent ataxia (FPA) is another syndrome, possibly related
to HMPA. Since the first description by Parker (1946), 16 families have been reported
with an autosomal dominant inheritance of this syndrome (Farmer and Mustian, 1963;
Hill and Sherman, 1968; White, 1969; Griggs et al, 1978; Donat and Auger, 1979;
Wolf, 1980; Margolin etal., 1981; Aimard^a/., 1983; Zazorinef al, 1983; Bouchard
et al, 1984; Trillet et al, 1985; Friedman and Hollmann, 1986; Gancher and Nutt,
1986; Nespeca et al., 1987). Major and minor differences between these families point
to heterogeneity in this group. Comparing the data of our family with those of FPA,
resemblance is found for the intermittent ataxia and the prevention of these attacks by
acetazolamide. Different are the long duration of the attacks in FPA and the presence
of vertigo, nausea and sometimes headache during the attacks. Also notably different
is the presence of nystagmus both during and between the attacks. In FPA attacks are
often provoked by exercise and by alcohol. A kinesigenic provocation is mentioned

only twice and a sensory aura is unusual. The pathophysiology of FPA is not clear.
A disorder of pyruvate metabolism, known to cause intermittent ataxia (Lonsdale et
al., 1969; Blass et al., 1970; Sander et al., 1980), has been reported in 1 family with
X-linked intermittent ataxia (Livingstone et al., 1984) and in 1 family with autosomal
dominantly inherited FPA (Nespeca et al., 1987). Atrophy of the cerebellum or of the
cerebellar vermis has been demonstrated in these 2 families and in 1 other family with
FPA (Vighetto et al., 1988). In HMPA, normal venous pyruvate and lactate levels in
1 family add to the improbability of a disorder of pyruvate metabolism.
Acetazolamide has not only been used to prevent attacks in FPA, but also in nonfamilial
paroxysmal ataxia (Voiculescu et al., 1975; Verlooy and Velis, 1985) and in several
paroxysmal dyskinesias (Mayeux and Fahn, 1982; Fahn, 1983; Fahn and Bressman,
1983). In FPA it has been suggested that the influence of acetazolamide on pyruvate
metabolism may play a role (Evans et al., 1978; Zazorin et al., 1983; Livingstone et
al., 1984) and also that its effect is caused by its carbonic anhydrase inhibiting action
(Wolf, 1980). The comparable effectiveness of acetazolamide and sulthiame in our family
with HMPA supports the idea that inhibition of carbonic anhydrase plays a role. In
the brain carbonic anhydrase is present in the choroid plexus and in glia (Giacobini,
1962; Maren, 1967). In lower doses, acetazolamide has an anticonvulsant action probably
caused by a local accumulation of CO2 in neurons and a hyperpolarization of the glia
cell membrane (Woodbury et al, 1982; White et al., 1986). Conceivably, its effect
in the prevention of attacks of ataxia is related to this effect on neuronal excitability
which thus may well be aspecific. The occurrence of paraesthesiae and increase in
myokymic activity, encountered as side effects in our patients, cannot be understood
from local carbonic anhydrase inhibition, as this enzyme has not been demonstrated
to be present in peripheral nerves. The alterations in pH and potassium homeostasis,
the shift in serum anion concentrations and retention of CO2 may play a role here.
In our view, the data from the comparison with PKC and FPA do not contradict the
idea, supported by comparison with neuromyotonia, that in HMPA alterations of neuronal
membrane properties exist and that it can be regarded as a disorder of membrane function.
