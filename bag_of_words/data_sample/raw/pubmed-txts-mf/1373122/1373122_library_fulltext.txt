We report the molecular characterization
of two novel galactosemia mutations that exhibit different molecular phenotypes. Both are of the missense type with low or no residual
enzyme activity. The R148W mutation results in an unstable
protein, although messenger RNA is still produced. In contrast, the L195P mutation produces stable but inactive immunoreactive protein. The R148W mutation alters an amino acid
that is not evolutionarily
conserved, while the L195P mutation affects a well-conserved
residue nine amino acids downstream from the putative active site nucleophile.
These mutations provide evidence that different mechanisms can result in
galactosemia:
destabilizing
mutations in any given area of the
protein and missense mutations in conserved domains of the
enzyme resulting in low or no activity. These two mutant alleles represent the fifth and sixth galactosemia
mutations and
confirm the hypothesis that galactosemia results from a multiplicity of mutations
at the molecular
level.

INTRODUCTION

The most common form of galactosemia (McKusick
230400) is the result of a deficiency in the enzyme galactose-l-phosphate
uridyltransferase
(GALT;2 EC
2.7.7.12; Segal, 1989). The metabolic result is an inability of the afflicted individual to metabolize galactose
properly, causing elevated levels of galactose and its metabolites in blood and other tissues. This disease is characterized in its acute neonatal form by lethargy, poor
feeding, and jaundice due to liver disease after milk ingestion. Neonatal death due to Escherichia coli sepsis is
not uncommon. Surviving untreated patients develop
the chronic complications of cataracts, cirrhosis, and
mental retardation. Since dietary galactose restriction
eliminates these symptoms, many U.S. states and West’ To whom correspondence

ern countries have instituted newborn screening programs to identify patients as early as possible. Unfortunately, long-term follow-up studies have revealed that
even early-treated and well-managed patients are prone
to develop chronic complications such as neurologic abnormalities and ovarian dysfunction (Waggoner et al.,
1990). Genetically, galactosemia is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder with an incidence of about
1:60,000 (Levy and Hammersen, 1978).
The molecular analysis of galactosemia began with
the cloning of a full-length, expressible cDNA encoding
human GALT (Reichardt and Berg, 1988a). This probe
demonstrated that the 13 galactosemic patients analyzed had normal GALT genes as assessedby Southern
blotting (Reichardt, 1989), full-length mRNA (Reichardt, 1989), and full-length immunoreactive protein
(CRM; Banroques et al., 1983; Reichardt, 1989). To date,
we have characterized four galactosemia mutations, two
GALT polymorphisms, and one silent nucleotide change
in human GALT (Reichardt and Woo, 1991; Reichardt
et al., 1991). These experiments led us to propose that (a)
galactosemia is caused by a multiplicity of mutations,
which may explain the clinical heterogeneity commonly
observed in this disease; and (b) mutations appear to
affect residues conserved in evolution, while polymorphisms alter variable amino acids. Thus, functionally
important residues are conserved in evolution and mutating them causes disease.
Here we report the molecular analysis of GALT in two
galactosemia patients. Each patient is a compound heterozygote for the common Ql88R mutation (Reichardt
et al., 1991) and both new mutations are rare. Thus, galactosemia is caused by a multiplicity
of mutations,
which is interesting in light of the clinical heterogeneity
observed in this disorder. One new mutation, L195P, fits
the pattern we had previously observed: this mutation
affects a well-conserved residue and results in no GALT
activity. Furthermore, it is located nine amino acids
downstream from the putative active site nucleophile. In
contrast, the other new mutation, R148W, defines a

novel molecular phenotype in galactosemia: this missense mutation affects a variable area of the protein and
leads to a destabilization
of the encoded polypeptide.
Thus, different molecular mechanisms, missense mutations in conserved domains resulting in inactive proteins
and missense mutations that destabilize the protein itself, can cause galactosemia.

a single 1.2-kb fragment (Reichardt and Woo, 1991).
After gel purification,
the PCR products were directly
sequenced using internal sequencing primers. This procedure eliminates Taq polymerase errors commonly observed in cloned PCR products. Both patients were compound heterozygotes for the previously identified Ql88R
galactosemia mutation (Reichardt et aZ., 1991; data not
shown). At nucleotide 470 of cell line JR113 we observed
a C to T transition resulting in the substitution
of arginine 148 with tryptophan
(R148W; Fig. 1A). We also
identified a second transition, T to C, at nucleotide 612
that replaces leucine 195 with proline (L195P; Fig. 2A).
We also examined whether these two mutations would
result in altered recognition sequences for restriction endonucleases in the cDNA with the MAP program. The
R148W mutation would lead to the loss of several such
sites, includingAZur1, HpaII, and NciI, Furthermore, this
mutation would lead to the gain of a BglII site. In contrast, no restriction recognition sites for commonly used
enzymes would be altered in the cDNA by the L195P
mutation.

We determined the frequencies of the R148W and
L195P galactosemia mutations by AS0 hybridization to
amplified normal, galactosemic, and Duarte GALT
cDNAs. Neither mutation was detected on normal alleles (O/14; Table 2). However, the R148W mutation was
present on 1 of 24 and L195P was found on 2 of the 24
galactosemia alleles tested (Table 2). Thus, these two
mutations are rare among the galactosemia alleles examined.

We examined the effects of the R148W and L195P
galactosemia mutations by comparing three published

Expression Analysis of the R148 W and Ll95P Mutations
We reconstructed both mutations by site-directed
mutagenesis in pJR16, a phagemid that expresses GALT
under control of the SV40 early promoter (Reichardt
and Woo, 1991). Introduction of the normal cDNA (pJR
16) into cos monkey cells resulted in a 19- to 32-fold
overexpression of GALT accompanied by a similar increase in immunoreactive protein (CRM; Table 1). In
contrast, the mutant constructs (pJR28 and 30) resulted
in a feeble stimulation of enzyme activity above background. In the case of pJR30 bearing the R148W mutation, we could not observe significant quantities of immunoreactive protein (Table 1 and Fig. 3A). However,
normal levels of mRNA could be detected in the transfected cos cells (Fig. 3B) and in the patient’s cells (Figs.
1A and 1B). Thus, we successfully electroporated this
construct into cos cells, and the cDNA in pJR30 is transcribed at normal levels but encodes an unstable GALT
polypeptide. The activity reported in Table 1 results
mostly from the endogenous enzyme (cf. Mock, Table 1).
In contrast, the L195P mutation in pJR28 results in

GALT sequences from distantly related organisms. We
assume that natural selection should conserve functionally important
residues.
We aligned the sequences
surrounding
the R148W and L195P mutations from the
homologous proteins GALT from humans, a multicellular eukaryote (Flach et aZ., 1990), GAL7 from Sacchuromyces cereuisiae, a unicellular eukaryote
(Tajima et al.,
19&Y), and galT from E. coli, a prokaryote
(Lemaire and
Mueller-Hill,
1986). The overall amino acid sequence
identity between these three distantly related proteins is
about 35% (Flach et CLZ.,1990). In the case of the R148W
mutation,
the mutated arginine is not conserved and
there is only limited homology surrounding
this site
(Fig. 4). However, this mutation results in an unstable
polypeptide and, therefore, the mutated arginine 148 is
probably not enzymatically
important.
In contrast, leutine 195 is conserved in galT from E. coli and is replaced
by isoleucine, a conservative
substitution,
in GAL7 from
yeast (Fig. 4). Furthermore,
leucine 195 is adjacent to a
conserved proline (Fig. 4) and it is surrounded by identical amino acids in galT from E. coli. Finally, the L195P
mutation
is located nine amino acid residues downstream from the putative active site nucleophile, histidine 186. Thus, the L195P galactosemia mutation alters
a well-conserved
residue in a critical domain of the enzyme.

and L195P alleles. The low frequency of these two mutations further supports our proposition that galactosemia
is caused by a multiplicity of mutations (Reichardt and
Woo, 1991). Thus, this molecular heterogeneity may be
related to the variable clinical outcome observed in this
disease. Expression analysis demonstrated that the two
mutations described here have different molecular phenotypes: the L195P mutation is typical of all previously
characterized galactosemia mutations. This mutation
results in stable immunoreactive protein with little or no
residual activity. In contrast, the R148W mutation represents a new class of galactosemia mutations, those resulting in unstable polypeptides. Thus, galactosemia can
be caused by mutations with different molecular phenotypes.
All four galactosemia mutations characterized to date
(Reichardt and Woo, 1991; Reichardt et al., 1991) were
found in conserved regions of the GALT protein. In contrast, the two published polymorphisms affected variable residues (Reichardt and Woo, 1991). Therefore, we
suggested that mutations in functionally important residues would not be tolerated in evolution, because such
mutations would be eliminated by natural selection, or
in people, because they would cause disease. Polymorphisms, on the other hand, affect variable residues. They
were found to be nonessential by natural selection and
are inconsequential in humans. We report in this paper
one mutation that fits our model: the L195P galactosemia mutation affects a residue in a conserved area of
the protein (Fig. 4). The mutated leucine is conserved in
galT from E. coli and is replaced by a very conservative
substitution, isoleucine, in GAL7 from yeast. Furthermore, there is an identical proline next to leucine 195
and an identical tryptophan five residues upstream. Finally, there is considerable sequence identity between
the human and E. coliproteins in this area (Fig. 4). It has

DISCUSSION

On the basis of appropriate Southern, Northern, and
Western blotting experiments with material from galactosemic patients, it had been proposed that this disease
is caused predominantly by missense mutations (Banroques et al., 1983; Reichardt, 1989). We tested this hypothesis by examining blood from classic galactosemia
patients in molecular detail. Thus far, we have identified
four disease-causing mutations, two polymorphisms in
human GALT, and one silent nucleotide substitution
(Reichardt and Woo, 1991; Reichardt et aZ., 1991). In
this paper we report the genotyping of two additional
galactosemia patients. Both are compound heterozygotes for the Ql88R mutation, the most common galactosemia mutations identified to date (Reichardt et al.,
1991). The two cell lines we examined in this study are
also heterozygous for two new mutations: the R148W

been shown that in E. coli galT histidine 166, homologous to human histidine 186, is the active site nucleophile involved in the formation of the covalent uridylate
reaction intermediate
(Kim et al., 1990). Therefore, the
L195P mutation not only occurs in a conserved area of
the protein but is also located in close proximity
to the
putative active site nucleophile, histidine 186. Since this
mutation occurs in an important domain of the enzyme,
it is not surprising
that the mutant enzyme is inactive
(Table 1). Finally, it is noteworthy
that galactosemia
mutations seem to cluster around the putative active site
nucleophile. We have identified three galactosemia mutations in the area surrounding
histidine
186: (1) the
F171S mutation (Reichardt and Woo, unpublished),
(2)
the QlS8R mutation (Reichardt et al., 1991), and (3) the
L195P mutation (this paper). Thus, the molecular data
on galactosemia mutations support the notion that histidine 186 in human GALT, which is homologous to E.
coli histidine 166, is the active site nucleophile.
The R148W galactosemia mutation differs in that it
occurs in a nonconserved
domain of GALT (Fig. 4). This
suggests that this residue is not functionally
important
and, in fact, the encoded protein is unstable. This results
in undetectable enzyme activity (Table l), thereby causing the disease state. The Rl48W
mutation defines a
new class of galactosemia mutations that encode unstable polypeptides. This class of mutations has been commonly observed in phenylketonuria
(PKU),
where the
majority of mutations are of the missense type with unstable polypeptides
(Okano et al., 1991).
It has been reported that the CpG dinucleotide is a hot
spot for mutation in humans because 5-methylcytosine
deaminates spontaneously to thymidine (Cooper and
Youssouffian, 1988). In fact, the R148W mutation occurs at a CpG dinucleotide. The L195P mutation, however, results in the formation of a new CpG dinucleotide.
It is interesting that we have observed in galactosemia as
many mutations (2) in CpG dinucleotides as formation
of new CpGs resulting from a mutation. Perhaps the
GALT gene does not undergo methylation at CpG dinucleotides, which is thought to be causing oxidative deaminations of 5-methylcytosines (Cooper and Youssouffian,
1988).
We report in this paper two novel galactosemia mutations that result from different molecular phenotypes.
The L195P mutation falls into the class of all previously
described galactosemia mutations: it is an enzyme with
low or no specific activity. This mutation occurs in a
well-conserved area of the protein in close proximity to
the putative active site nucleophile. The R148W mutation defines a new class of galactosemia mutations that
result in undetectable enzyme activity due to the instability of the encoded polypeptide. Thus, galactosemia
mutations, while generally of the missense type, can
have at least two molecular mechanisms: low or no specific activity and unstable polypeptide chain. Therefore,
a multiplicity of mutations can cause galactosemia, re-
