110 patients with far advanced head and neck squamous or testicular carcinoma were treated with bleomycin given by intravenous (i.v.) or intramuscular (i.m.) injection according to a randomized assignment. While responses were observed more frequently in patients treated by the intramuscular route, no superiority can be attributed clearly to intramuscular therapy. Responses were seen in 6.2% of head and neck squamous carcinoma patients (5/81; i.m. 3/38, 8%; i.v. 2/41, 5%) while 14% of testicular tumors responded (4/29; i.m. 4/13, 29%; i.v. 0/16, 0%). Toxicity was, in general, manageable.
