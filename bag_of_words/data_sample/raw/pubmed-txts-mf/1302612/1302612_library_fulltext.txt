Three novel Tay-Sachs Disease (TSD) mutations have been
identified in two unrelated, non-Jewish compound
heterozygous patients. A G772C transversion mutation
causing an Asp258His substitution is shared by both patients.
The mutant enzyme had been characterized, on the basis of
previous kinetic studies (1) as a Bl, or a-subunit active site
mutation. This is the first Bl mutation not found in codon
178 (exon 5). A C508T transition causing an Argl70Trp
substitution also occurred in one of the patients. The third
mutation is a two base deletion occurring in exon 8 involving
the toss of either nts 927-928 or 929-930 in codon 310. The
deletion creates an inframe termination codon 35 bases
downstream. The Argl70Trp mutation was also detected in
a third unrelated TSD patient. In both families this allele was
traced to French Canadian ancestors originating in the Estrie
region of the province of Quebec. This mutation is the third
TSD allele unique to the French Canadian population and
the ancestral origins of the carrier parents are distant from
the center of diffusion of the more common 7.6 kb deletion
mutation which is in the eastern part of the province.
INTRODUCTION
Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is an autosomal recessively inherited
lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of
GM2 ganglioside in the neurons of the central cortex. The
deficient enzyme, hexosaminidase A (Hex A), is a heterodimer
of a and /S subunits encoded by the HEXA and HEXB genes
respectively. Mutations in the HEXA gene cause TSD, which,
in its classical form produces blindness, paralysis and dementia
in infants. The frequency of TSD is elevated in the
Ashkenazi -Jewish and French-Canadian populations (2).
Over 40 different mutations in the HEXA gene have been
identified. Their enumeration is useful in understanding the broad
clinical spectrum of the GM2 gangliosidoses, in investigating
structure-function relationships in the HEXA gene product and
in studying the genetic structure of populations.

Bl mutations occur in the HEXA gene resulting in loss of asubunit catalytic function and reduction of hydrolysis of GM2
ganglioside and the sulfated synthetic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-/3-D-N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate (4MUGS). These
mutations are associated with a form of enzyme which has
electrophoretic and thermolability properties characteristic of Hex
A but catalytic activity only toward electrically neutral substrates
such as 4-methylumbelliferyl-/3-D-N-acetylg]ucosamine (4MUG).
We studied two patients with infantile TSD whose serum and
fibroblasts contained heterozygote levels of Hex A. Biochemical
studies on patients 1 and 2 were described previously (1). Both
patients appeared to be heterozygous for the Bl phenotype having
virtually no capacity for hydrolysis of the sulfated Hex A substrate
4MUGS.
RESULTS
In all cases, exons carrying the mutations were detected using
SSCP analysis of genomic DNA (data not shown). Sequence
alterations in amplification products are shown in figure 1. A
G772C transversion in exon 7 results in an Asp258His
substitution in patients 1 (top) and 2 (data not shown). In patient
1 and his mother a C508T transition in exon 5 results in a
Argl70Trp substitution (middle). In patient 2 an exon 8 deletion
of a CT dinucleotide at positions 927-928 or 929-930 occurs
in codon 310 producing a 'double ladder' in sequencing gels
(bottom). An inframe stop codon TGA 35 bp downstream
(bottom) is created with the result that this mutation is expected
to produce no immunoreactive protein due to premature
termination of translation.
The mutations in exons 5 and 8 could be confirmed by
restriction enzyme digestion of amplified genomic DNA
sequences of the proband and parents. The mutation in exon 5
abolishes a ScrFI site. Thus the presence of a 165 bp undigested
fragment in both patient 1 and his mother and its absence in the
patient's father and in control DNA confirmed the findings of
the sequencing gel and identifies the mother as the source of the

DISCUSSION

CG

The three novel mutations extend our knowledge of the range
of mutant genotypes at the HEXA locus associated with infantile
TSD. All Bl mutations which have been reported elsewhere have
a substitution in codon 178 (exon 5) in which arginine is replaced
by histidine (6), cysteine (7) or leucine (4). Site-specific
mutagenesis studies by Brown et al (8) have confirmed that
Argl78 is required for the catalytic activity of Hex A. Patients
1 and 2 were previously reported to be heterozygous for a B1
phenotype (1). The fibroblast Hex A obtained from both these
patients showed a profound decrease in the ratio of
4MUGS/4MUG hydrolysis which is a measure of catalysis by
the enzyme's a-subunit relative to catalysis by its (3-subunit.
Furthermore, residual catalytic activity toward 4MUGS had a
pH optimum in the range of 2.0—2.6 compared to 3.9 for control
Hex A. This unusual property in both patients suggested a
common Bl allele which was different from either of the codon
178 Bl mutations. The aspartyl residue at codon 258 may,
therefore, play a role in the catalytic mechanism of glycoside
cleavage. The suggestion that aspartyl and/or glutamyl residues
function in hexosaminyl bond cleavage has received some
experimental support from the site-specific mutagenesis studies
of Vavougios and Mahuran (9). We speculate that this aspartyl
group furnishes a proton required for glycoside hydrolysis and
in the mutant enzyme residual a-subunit catalytic function occurs
at low pH because the only protons available are in water.

exon 5 mutation (figure 2, top). The exon 8 mutation introduces
a PvuII site. The presence of restriction fragments of 162 bp and
105 bp in DNA amplified from both patient 2 and his father
following PvuII digestion confirms this mutation and identifies
the father as the origin of this mutant allele (figure 2, top).
The mutation in exon 7 was confirmed by allele-specific
oligonucleotide hybridization to amplified exon 7 sequences. This
mutation was detected in both patients 1 and 2 (figure 2, bottom)
and was of paternal and maternal origin respectively. Sequencing
of exon 5 in both patients ruled out the presence of any of the
previously described codon 178 Bl alleles (figure 1, data shown
for patient 1 only).

Both patients inherited the exon 7 mutation from a parent with
Scottish—Irish heritage. The exon 5 mutation is of
French—Canadian origin (family 7 in reference (14)). French
Canadians have a frequency of TSD higher than that of the
general population and the predominant mutation in this
population group (15) is a 7.6 kb deletion at the 5' end of the
HEXA gene (16). This mutation has a center of diffusion in the
Gaspe" region of the province of Que~bec (17). The exon 5
mutation has not been previously encountered in the province
of Quebec. The French Canadian ancestors of patient 1 emigrated
from a region of Quebec different from those known to be centers
of diffusion for respectively, the common exon 1 mutation and
the intron 7 +1 TSD allele (Lac St. Jean) (14). A second case
of infantile TSD due to the exon 5 allele (R. Gravel, personal
communication) in a child of French Canadian ancestry has been
identified in a family unrelated to that of patient 1. Ancestors
of both exon 5 TSD patients emmigrated from the Estrie region
of Quebec and lived within 60 miles of each other. It would be
surprising if among the present inhabitants of this region
additional carriers of the C508T TSD allele were not found.

METHODS
Single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was performed
according to Orita et al (3) as modified by Triggs-Raine et al (4). PCR amplification
of HEXA exons and flanking sequences was according to Triggs-Raine et al (4).
Direct sequencing of amplified PCR products was performed by the method of
Sanger et al. (5). Details of procedures used for confirmation of mutations are
reported in the legend to figure 2. Nucleodde position numbers refer to cDNA
sequence and commence with the ATG initiation codon.

The initial genotype assignment of the parents of patient 1 and
2, based on serum Hex A and Hex B measurement have been
proven correct by data presented in figure 2. The father of patient
1 and the mother of patient 2, both carrying the exon 7 mutant
allele, had enzyme values within the TSD heterozygote range
when genotypes were assigned using the 4MUGS substrate
whereas the values were in or close to the 'grey zone' when Hex
A and B were assayed with 4MUG using thermal fractionation
(1) (%Hex A in serum: control range, 6 0 - 8 1 % ; heterozygote
range, 34-55%; father patient 1, 57%; mother patient 2, 55%).
Kinetic studies performed on Hex A prepared from fibroblasts
obtained from patients 1 and 2 gave different Vmax values
(expressed as a ratio of a//9 active sites). When expressed in this
manner the Vmax is independant of the number of enzyme
molecules and becomes equivalent to a turnover number. The
Vmax of patient 1 Hex A was 0.29 and of patient 2 Hex A was
0.006 nmole 4MUGS cleaved/4MUG unit of enzyme. Control
Hex A has a Vmax of 0.91 nmoles 4MUGS cleaved/4MUG unit
of enzyme (1). Since the exon 8 mutation is incompatible with
gene product expression the assignment of the Bl phenotype to
the G772C allele becomes unequivocal. The relatively higher
value for patient 1 Vmax suggested that the other TSD allele,
carrying the exon 5 mutation, might be associated with a small
but significant amount of kinetically normal Hex A. The exon
5 mutation is a hydrophilic—hydrophobic substitution, which is
compatible with a conformation change in the protein which
prevents exit from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (10,11).
Nakano et al (12) have identified a TSD mutation at an adjacent
base in codon 170. The occurrence of multiple mutations at this
CpG dinucleotide pair suggests the presence of a mutagenic
'hotspot' (13).
