The frequency and inheritance of three restriction fragment length polymorphisms
(RFLPs) of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene were investigated in 27 South
African families with familial hypercholesterolaemia. Four haplotypes, defined by the enzymes
PvuII, Stul, and NcoI, were found to segregate in this population. The frequency of the rare
allele detected by NcoI was found to be 0-53 in 45 unrelated familial hypercholesterolaemic (FH)
patients compared to 0-33 in 60 normal controls (p<0.005). In 71% of the families studied, a haplotype with common alleles for PvuII and Stul and the rare allele for NcoI cosegregated with the
defective gene. In 20% of the families, a second haplotype with rare alleles for PvuII and Stul
and common allele for NcoI segregated with FH. In these families the haplotypes unambiguously
cosegregate with the disease and can therefore be used for early diagnosis of FH.
SUMMARY

Mutations in the human gene for the low density
lipoprotein (LDL) receptors produce the clinical
syndrome of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH).1
These receptors are located in coated pits on the cell
surface, bind plasma LDL, and carry it into cells by
receptor mediated endocytosis. In patients with FH,
the genetically defective receptors cause LDL to
accumulate to high levels in plasma, which eventually leads to atherosclerosis.
At least 10 different mutant alleles at the LDL
receptor locus can be distinguished through biochemical studies of cultured fibroblasts from FH
patients.2 A cDNA clone for the human LDL
receptor gene has recently been isolated,3 which
enables one to study these receptor defects at DNA
level. DNA restriction site polymorphisms (RFLPs)
around or within structural genes allow identification of alleles, which can be used to study the association with a disease within a population, or segregation of marker alleles and disease within a family.

Previous studies have shown that a PvuII restriction
enzyme polymorphism of the LDL receptor gene
can be used to show that alleles of this genetic
marker
coinherit with familial hypercholesterol*4

aemia.

We have previously reported two new RFLPs at
the LDL receptor gene locus.5 6 Both the restriction
enzymes Stul and NcoI identify two allele polymorphisms which are informative for family studies
and early diagnosis of FH. In this study we report
the frequency of the three LDL receptor gene
restriction site polymorphisms in the normocholesterolaemic and FH populations. A study of haplotype associations with FH in 27 informative families
show a predominant association of two haplotypes
with the disease.

Subjects and methods
Blood samples were collected from 45 selected FH
patients attending the lipid clinic at Tygerberg
Hospital, Tygerberg, South Africa. Pedigree analyses were performed on 27 of these patients and

Haplotype associations of three DNA polymorphisms
blood samples were collected from 292 of the family
members. The patients were selected as having FH
when the following criteria were fulfilled. Total
serum cholesterol levels of all patients had to be at
least equal to the 90th centile for their age and sex
categories of a typical South African white population. If patients received cholesterol lowering drugs
(cholestyramine, probucol, bezafibrate, or nicotinic
acid) in full dose, singly or in combination, they
were included in the FH study group only if their
total cholesterol level was at least equal to the 70th
centile for the age and sex group. All FH study
participants had normal serum triglyceride levels
equal to or lower than 2*0 mmol/l. In addition, a FH
study participant had to have either clinical features
of FH (tendon xanthoma of the Achilles tendon or
tendons on the dorsum of the hand with or without
xanthelasma) or a family history of early coronary
heart disease (CHD). An early CHD family history
was defined as being present when the FH participant reported that at least two first or second degree
relatives suffered CHD before the age of 50 years.
Blood samples from 60 normocholesterolaemic,
Afrikaans speaking, white subjects were obtained
from the laboratory population and from unaffected
spouses of subjects with FH. Total serum cholesterol levels of the normocholesterolaemic study
group were not higher than the 50th centile for their
age and sex categories of a typical white South
African population.7 Their serum triglyceride levels
were also normal (2 mmol/l). All the other
criteria for FH were absent in this study group.
LIPID DETERMINATION

The total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein
(HDL) cholesterol levels were measured on a Gilford auto-analyser using the Boehringer CHODPAP enzymatic method. HDL cholesterol was
measured after precipitation of the apoprotein B
containing lipoproteins with dextran sulphatemagnesium chloride. The triglyceride levels were
determined by the Boehringer enzymatic Peridochrom method. In each case the Gilford autoanalyser was calibrated against Precilip or Precilip
EL control sera, which were corrected by Boehringer Mannheim for the specific test kit in question.
Two control samples were included in each batch
analysed.
DNA PREPARATION AND RFLP ANALYSIS

DNA was prepared from the blood samples by a
Triton-X100 lysis method.8 Aliquots of the DNA (5
ig) were digested with the restriction enzymes PvuII,
Stul, and NcoI, using conditions recommended by
the suppliers (Boehringer Mannheim). DNA fragments were separated by size on a 0-6% agarose gel

751

and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher
and Schnell, BA85, 0.45 nm) by the Southern

blotting technique.9

The human DNA probe for the LDL receptor
gene, pLDLR-2HH1, was obtained from Dr D W
Russell of Dallas. It consists of a 1-9 kb fragment of
the 3' end of the LDL receptor cDNA clone and
subcloned into a BamHI site of the vector pSP64.3
The insert was excised with BamHI, separated from
the vector on a 1% agarose gel, and recovered. The
probe DNA was labelled in vitro by nick translation
to a specific activity of 108 cpm/,ug (BRL Kit, Amersham International).
Filters were prehybridised for three hours at 65°C
in 3xSSC (1xSSC: 0*15 mol/l NaCl, 0-015 mol/l
sodium citrate), 0*1% sodium dodecyl sulphate
(SDS), 10x Denhardt's solution, 50 ig/ml denatured
salmon sperm DNA (Sigma), and 10 ig/ml poly A
(Sigma). The probe was then added at a concentration of 50 ng/ml and hybridisations were carried out
for 22 hours at 65°C. Filters were finally washed in
1 x SSC, 0-1% SDS and exposed to Kodak XAR film
for one to three days.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

x2 tests were performed to document that the popu-

lations investigated were or were not in HardyWeinberg equilibrium and to compare the chromosomal frequencies.

DNA of heterozygotes showing recognition sites of
PvuII, Stul, and NcoI are illustrated diagrammatically in fig 2a, b, and c respectively. The alleles defined using the restriction enzyme PvuII are characterised by DNA fragments of 16-5 and 3-6 kbp

defined by StuI are characterised by two fragments

POPULATIONS

The distribution of genotypes and frequencies of the
three RFLP alleles were determined in 60 normocholesterolaemic and 45 unrelated FH subjects
(table 2). The distribution of genotypes is close to
the expected value if the population is in HardyWeinburg equilibrium, but a statistically significant
increase in the rare allele of the NcoI polymorphism
above the values in the normocholesterolaemic
group was found in the FH population (x2= 17-2,
p<0-005). This indicates population association of
this allele with a gene predisposing to hypercholesterolaemia. For the Stul and PvuII RFLPs
there is no statistically significant difference in allele
frequency between the normocholesterolaemic and
FH populations.

lotypes of double heterozygotes were inferred from
the pedigree. (There were 14 double heterozygotes
in the normal population and two in the FH
population for whom pedigree information was
unavailable, so they are therefore not included.)
Haplotypes for 43 unrelated FH (86 haplotypes) and
46 normocholesterolaemic subjects (92 haplotypes)
are shown in table 4.
The demonstration of only a few genotype and
haplotype combinations in the populations can be
interpreted as non-random association of the three
DNA markers of the LDL receptor gene. One of the
haplotypes, PISIN2, shows a significantly higher
incidence in the FH group (32% in normocholesterolaemics compared with 54% in hypercholesterolaemics). The predominance of the N2 allele
of the NcoI polymorphism in FH subjects is clear in
tables 2 and 3.

We have used the PvuII, Stul, and NcoI polymorphisms to follow the inheritance of the LDL
receptor gene in 27 informative families in which FH
occurs. In 17 families (46 normal and 75 affected offspring) the PlSlN2 haplotype and the FH phenotype cosegregated. An example of one extended
family is shown in fig 3a. The FH phenotype was
associated with the P2S2N1 haplotype in seven
informative families, where 38 normal and 46
affected offspring were analysed (example of one
family in fig 3b). The PiSIN1 haplotype has shown
association with the FH phenotype in two families
(four normal and eight affected offspring) and the
P2SlN1 haplotype in only one family (seven normal
and eight affected offspring).
Table 5 shows the frequencies of the different
haplotypes associated with FH in 34 unrelated FH
heterozygotes. The FH haplotypes were deduced
from the pedigree analyses in the 27 families and
from seven patients homozygous for all three
RFLPs. In 71% of the FH families studied, the
PlS1N2 haplotype cosegregates with the defective
gene, while the P2S2N1 haplotype segregates in
20% of families. The PISINI and P2S1N1 haplotypes are associated with the FH phenotype in only
6% and 3% of families studied, respectively.

The association of the P1S1N2 and P2S2N1
haplotypes with FH in the white South African
population were further confirmed in five clinical
FH homozygotes. Four have shown P1P1S1S1N2N2
genotypes, while one is a heteroallelic genetic
compound with a PlP2SlS2NlN2 genotype, containing both the P1S1N2 axid P2P2N1 haplotypes.
The haplotypes were deduced from family studies.
The haplotypes and lipid results of five FH homozygotes are shown in table 6.

Discussion
The prevalence of FH in South Africa is unusually
high and a 'founder gene' effect in the Afrikaner
population has been proposed." LDL receptor
studies of South African FH homozygotes have
shown a predominance of a receptor defective type
of abnormality.'2

Haplotype associations of three DNA polymorphisms
normocholesterolaemic subjects, we have found a
statistically significant excess of the rare N2 allele of
the NcoI RFLP in the FH population. The PvuII,
Stul, and Ncol RFLPs have been used to follow the
inheritance of the LDL receptor gene in 27 informative FH families. In 71% of these the P1S1N2
haplotype cosegregated with the defective gene.
This association was further confirmed in five FH
homozygotes. Four were homozygous for the P1S1N2
haplotype and one a genetic compound with both
the P1SlN2 and P2S2N1 haplotypes; in 20% of FH
families studied the FH phenotype cosegregated
with the P2S2N1 haplotype. The PlSlNl and
P2S1N1 haplotypes have been associated with the
FH phenotype in only 6% and 3% of families
studied respectively. Studies are under way to confirm
these rare FH haplotypes in clinical FR homozygotes.
If, as expected for polymorphisms around a single
gene, there is no recombination between the three
RFLPs, it will be possible to combine the information on all three RFLPs to form an unequivocal haplotype for any subject. In the 27 families studied so
far, we have observed no recombination within the
DNA region of the LDL receptor gene covered by
the three RFLPs. Analyses of associations of RFLPs
have revealed only four of the possible eight haplotypes. This may be an indication that the PvuII,
StuI, and NcoI RFLPs are non-randomly associated.
Since the S2 allele is found only in association with
the P2 allele, whereas the Si allele is found with
both the P1 and P2 allele, it is likely that the PvuII
polymorphism evolved before the StuI -olymorphism. The base pair changes creating the loss
of a StuI site must have arisen on a chromosome 19
with a P2 genotype. Similarly we can postulate that
the PvuII polymorphism has arisen in the presence
of the Ni allele, since the N2 allele is never found in
association with P2S1 or P2S2 genotypes.
Haplotype analysis alone is not sufficient to distinguish normal from FH chromosomes, since the
same haplotypes were found in both the normal and
FH populations. This finding is interpreted as an
indication that the LDL receptor gene haplotypes
were established at a point in evolution before the
mutations causing FH. It further implies that the FH
mutations evolved independently from one another,
suggesting that a particular mutation is likely to be
associated with a specific haplotype. Variations at
these three polymorphic sites may serve as valuable
genetic markers, for the identification of different

755

FR mutations, for population studies, and as a basis
for prenatal diagnosis of many FH mutations.
