SUMMARY
A Japanese kindred with dominantly inherited amyloid poly neuropathy, commonly called familial amyloid
polyneuropathy (FAP), has been identified. Amyloid protein was transthyretin (TTR) related and the patients
were heterozygous for the mutant gene encoding TTR with a single amino acid substitution of cysteine
for tyrosine at position 114. This family originated in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan, and 12 of the 36 known
members of six generations have been affected. The initial symptoms occurred in their thirties with the
cardinal features of polyneuropathy, vitreous opacities and cardiac disease. Sensory neuropathy was severe
in the lower limbs. Autonomic disturbances, especially postural hypotension, were the most debilitating
to the patients. Amyloid deposits were detected widely in most organs except for the central nervous system.
The duration from the onset of the disease to death was within 10 yrs. Heart failure caused by heavy amyloid
deposits was the most common cause of sudden death.

INTRODUCTION

Among familial systemic amyloidoses, only type I familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP)
was known to exist in Japan in the past two decades (Araki et al., 1968; Kito et al.,
1980). It is clinicopathologically identical with the disease first found in Portugal in
1952 (Andrade) and subsequently in many countries. The molecular basis of the disease
is a single amino acid substitution of methionine for valine at position 30 of the
transthyretin (TTR) molecule, TTRMet3° (Dwulet and Benson, 1983, 1984; Tawara
et al., 1983; Saraiva et al., 1984).
In 1990, we identified three additional mutations in the TTR gene from three different
Japanese families with amyloid polyneuropathy, TTR Cysll \ TTRGI>r42 and TTRArB5°
(Ueno et al., 1990a,b). Subsequently, we found three more mutants, TTRAr8i8 (Saeki
etal, 1991), TTRnc50 and TTR1*1130 (unpublished data) in another three families,
thereby giving evidence for the molecular heterogeneity of the Japanese FAP. The one

with a substitution of cysteine for tyrosine at position 114 (TTRCysl14) was found in
the largest of the six families. We describe the clinicopathologic features of patients
in this kindred.
PATIENTS
The present family originated in Kunimi, Nagasaki Prefecture. [It is noteworthy that two kindreds with
different mutations, TTRMct3° in Arao (Kumamoto Prefecture) and TTRC>""4 in Kunimi, were identified
within a relatively small area.] The family history through six generations revealed 12 affected members
with autosomal dominant inheritance (Fig. 1). The family register showed that the proband's greatgrandmother (1-2) was born in 1835 and died at the age of 88, but no detailed information is available.

FIG. 1. The pedigree of the family with FAP associated with the TTR C y l " 4 gene.

In 1937 the proband's grandfather (II-2) moved from Kunimi to Osaka, where his descendants have lived.
The grandfather reportedly suffered from visual cloudiness, fainting on standing and intractable diarrhoea.
The proband's mother (TJI-4) had visual cloudiness, fainting and difficulty with urination. She died suddenly
at the age of 50 yrs. The proband's brother (IV-1) suffered from visual cloudiness, marked weight loss
and difficulty in urination. He died at the age of 49 yrs. Five other family members (III-5, 7; IV-3, 5,
10) were reportedly affected by this disease. Dysaesthesiae in the lower limbs, bowel and sphincter
disturbances, and dizziness on standing occurred in their thirties. Three of them had visual cloudiness.
All five died in their early forties. In 1970 the proband (IV-2) first visited Osaka University Hospital and
we have examined three affected relatives (V-2, 6, 9) since then. The clinical and laboratory features are
summarized in Table 1.

Case IV-2
This male proband developed visual cloudiness and then impotence, cold feet and orthostatic dizziness
at the age of 39 yrs. Three years later, he began to experience vomiting, urinary incontinence, chronic
constipation and muscular weakness in the lower limbs. On admission at the age of 42 yrs, his blood pressure
was 132/90 lying and 94/64 standing, with a constant pulse rate of 82. Vitreous opacity was present in
the right eye. Cardiomegaly was absent. The cranial nerves and upper limbs were unremarkable. He had
moderately atrophic muscles in the distal part of the lower limbs. There were decreased light-touch pain
and thermal senses in the lower limbs, more distally, while position and vibratory senses were slightly
impaired below the ankles. The results of routine laboratory tests were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
was normal except for increased protein (98 mg/dl). Valsalva manoeuvre produced no decrease in the
heart rate. A cold test showed no increase in the heart rate. Noradrenaline infusion raised blood pressure
from 118/78 to 180/122 and the heart rate from 84 to 140. Intravenous atropine infusion resulted in no
increase in the heart rate. Sweating was markedly reduced on the surface of the legs and back. Cystometry
revealed a neurogenic atonic bladder. Sural nerve biopsy showed depletion of nerve fibres, but Congo
red staining was negative.
Over the next 3 yrs, proprioception became markedly decreased below the knee and lost in the toes.
He worked as a booking clerk until his sudden death at the age of 46 yrs. A limited autopsy elsewhere
revealed gross cardiomegaly (500 g), but no myocardial infarction was found.
Case V-6
This case was a nephew of the proband. He began to have difficulty in urination and became sexually
impotent at the age of 34 yrs. Three years later, he experienced the first attack of syncope on standing,
developed cold feet and burnt his leg without feeling pain. He also developed visual cloudiness in his left
eye and chronic constipation. On admission at the age of 38 yrs, his blood pressure was 162/100 lying
and 50/0 standing, with a constant pulse rate of 78. Vitreous opacity was present in the left eye. There
was no abnormality in the upper limbs but moderately atrophic muscles were present in the distal part
of lower limbs. Light-touch, pain and thermal senses were moderately impaired in the lower limbs, more
distally but vibratory and position senses were normal. Valsalva manoeuvre produced little change in the

heart rate. Sweating was markedly diminished on the trunk and lower limbs. Cerebrospinal fluid showed
a total protein of 338 mg/dl at the age of 38 yrs (Table 2). Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly. Sural
nerve biopsy showed depletion of both myelinated and unmyelinated fibres, axonal degeneration and small
deposits of Congo red-positive substances. He was able to walk with mechanical assistance until his sudden
death at the age of 40 yrs.

At post-mortem, widespread amyloid deposits were found in the blood vessel walls and perivascular
areas in virtually all organs except in the parenchyma of the brain and spinal cord. The leptomeninges
of the spinal cord were thickened by massive amyloid deposits. Cardiac weight was 480 g and there was
concentric hypertrophy of the myocardium with amyloid deposits (Fig. 2A,B,C). Amyloid was heavily
deposited in the mucosa and submucosa of the stomach and small intestine. In the kidney, the perivascular
space contained only slight amyloid deposits (Fig. 3A,B). In the autonomic nerves in the kidney, amyloid
deposits were observed within the perineurium and epineurium (Fig. 4A,B).
Case V-2
This case was also a nephew of the proband. He developed coldness of the legs and intermittent shooting
pain in the posterior thighs at the age of 31 yrs and developed impotence, orthostatic dizziness and alternating
diarrhoea and constipation with incontinence by the age of 35 yrs. On examination, he had orthostatic
hypotension, slight muscle atrophy and decreased pain and thermal sensation distally in the legs. Vibratory
and position senses were severely impaired only in the toes. The sural nerve and rectal biopsies showed
slight amyloid deposits. There was decreased sweating in the lower limbs and autonomic function tests
showed widespread disturbance of the autonomic nervous system (Table 3). During the next year, his
symptoms worsened and he developed vitreous opacities and dysaesthesiae in the hands. The serum TTR
level was low (8.5 mg/dl, normal range: 21 —43 mg/dl) and CSF protein was 71 mg/dl. He died suddenly
at the age of 38 yrs. At autopsy, amyloid deposits were observed in the perivascular space of every organ
studied, but not in the spinal cord. The brain was not examined. The sciatic nerve contained amyloid deposits
which were also strained with anti-TTR serum (Fig. 5A,B). In the kidney, amyloid deposits were found
only in the perivascular space.
Case V-9
This case is a son of the proband's cousin. He noticed dizziness on standing at the age of 34 yrs, and
then developed impotence, difficulty in urination, muscle weakness and dysaesthesiae in the thighs. At
the age of 36 yrs, the examination revealed orthostatic hypotension, vitreous opacities, muscle atrophy
and decreased touch and pain sensation distally in the legs. He had a clinical course similar to that of
the previous three patients, and has been confined to a wheelchair since the age of 38 yrs. Sural nerve
and gastric mucosa biopsies showed amyloid deposits. Laboratory findings were normal except for a low
concentration of serum TTR (10 mg/dl) and elevated CSF protein (74 mg/dl). There was no elevation
of the serum noradrenaline or adrenaline levels on standing. The pupils were unresponsive to tyramine
but were dilated by adrenaline.

LABORATORY FINDINGS

Immunohistochemistry for amyloid deposition
The tissue specimens were subjected to immunohistochemical staining with anti-TTR
antiserum and 24 other antisera including immunoglobulin and Bence Jones protein (x
and X chains), but amyloid deposits reacted only with anti-TTR antiserum (Figs 2, 4,
5). Amyloid fibrils, prepared from autopsied kidney tissue by the method of Costa et al.
(1978), possessed 1TK by a double immunodiffusion assay (data not shown).
Autonomic cardiovascular responses
Orthostatic hypotension without increase in the heart rate and a lack of response of
the blood pressure and heart rate to cold stimulation indicated that the cardiac sympathetic
nervous system was predominantly affected. Decreased secretion of adrenaline and
noradrenaline in response to postural changes confirmed sympathetic disturbance. R-R
interval variations with posture, Valsalva manoeuvre and at forced respiration were
abnormal, indicating impairment of the parasympathetic nervous system. Intravenous
noradrenaline infusion caused abnormally high blood pressure. Intravenous atropine
infusion failed to induce a significant increase of the heart rate. Typical and representative
data (Case V-2) are shown in Table 3.

Cerebrospinal fluid protein and serum TTR
Cerebrospinal fluid and sera were analysed for albumin, IgG and TTR concentrations.
All three proteins were reduced in the sera, while the total CSF protein increased as
the disease process advanced (Table 2). Transthyretin in the CSF can be divided into
two components. One is blood-CSF (B-CSF) barrier-dependent TTR, which can be
estimated from the concentration of TTR in the serum and the concentration gradient
(serum/CSF) of albumin. The other is B-CSF barrier-independent TTR, which can be
calculated by subtraction of the B-CSF barrier-dependent TTR from the measured TTR
(Weisner and Roethig, 1983). The barrier-dependent TTR was a minor component,
but it increased gradually as the disease progressed. The B-CSF barrier-independent
TTR decreased in parallel to the serum TTR.

DNA diagnosis of the mutant 777?
We previously reported that two patients in this family (V-2, 6) were heterozygous
for the TTRCysl14 gene (Ueno et ai, 1990a). Since then, one patient (V-9) and one
asymptomatic person in this family were found, by nucleotide sequence analysis to have
the mutant gene. As the single base change in the TTR gene did not produce a new
restriction site, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis could not
be used as a direct means of detecting this mutation. We used a modified oligonucleotide
primer which was designed to create a new restriction site for the endonuclease Hgi
AI in the gene fragments encoding a mutant allelic exon 4. Analysis of RFLP combined
with polymerase chain reaction using this primer enabled us to detect the TTRCysl14
gene (Fig. 6). We have not carried out DNA analysis in other members of this family.
DISCUSSION

The clinicopathological features of the cases presented here are characterized by early
involvement of the autonomic and sensory nervous systems and carry certain similarities
as well as dissimilarities with the type I FAP caused by the mutant gene encoding
TTRMct3° which has been reported from three large foci in Portugal (Andrade et al.,

Fie. 6. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of a mutant allelic fragment containing an A to G
transition. The DNA sequence of the TTR gene and cDNA were based on the published data (Mita et al., 1984; Tsuzuki
el al., 1985). A 28 nucleotide forward primer carrying a substitution of 6 for C (5'-TACACCATTGCCGCCCTGCTGAGCCC6T-3') and a 22 nucleotide backward primer (5'-ATTGTCTCTGCCTGGACTTCTA-3') were
designed for amplification of the two different allelic fragments (197 bp) using the polyerase chain reaction. The normal
one had a single base change (C to 6 ) , and the mutant one had to base changes (C to 6 and A to G). Only the latter
allelic sequence could produce a new restriction site for the endonuclease Hgi AI (GTGCTC), and thereby the mutant
allelic segment could be digested into two fragments (166 bp and 31 bp). The gel electrophoresis showed that the three
patients (lane 1, Case V-2; lane 2, Case V-6; lane 3, Case V-9) and one of their relatives (lane 4) were heterozygous
for Hgi AI site in the TTR gene, while normal controls had no Hgi AI site (lanes 5 and 6). The size marker <f> x 174/Hae

Age of onset, clinical course and sex ratio
The mean age of onset for four patients was 34 yrs and the disease most probably
started in their thirties in eight presumably affected cases, which is similar to those
in the majority of type I FAP cases from Portugal (Coutinho et al., 1980) and Japan
(Araki et al., 1980). However, the Swedish type I FAP occurred in the sixth decade
(Andersson et al., 1970, 1976).
Three of the four patients studied here suddenly died several years after the onset
of symptoms without falling into cachexia. The eight presumably affected cases in the
present family probably also died within 10 yrs of the onset of symptoms. On the other
hand, the patients with type I FAP from Portugal, Japan and Sweden were frequently

emaciated, confined to bed and died within 10—15 yrs, although some patients lived
for more than 30 yrs after the onset of symptoms.
Since FAP presented here and type IFAP are transmitted by the autosomal dominant
mode, it is expected to affect both sexes equally. However, the proportion of men to
women was 2:1 both in our family with the TTRCys"4 gene and in the Swedish group
with the TTRMcl30 gene (Andersson et al., 1976). It is known that the disease tends to
manifest earlier in men than in women in the Japanese and Portuguese groups with the
TTRMet3° gene (Coutinho et al., 1980; Kito et al., 1980). These findings suggest that
there may be some sex-related factors which accelerate amyloid deposition.
Initial symptoms
Although the initial symptoms were different, the four patients studied here commonly
developed both sensory and autonomic disturbances within 3 yrs after the onset. Onefifth of the Portuguese cases with type I FAP had sensory neuropathy of the lower limbs
which was followed by autonomic dysfunction, while dysautonomia preceded the sensory
symptoms in a quarter of the cases (Andrade, 1952). The initial symptoms in 50% of
the cases with Japanese type I FAP in Kumamoto (Ikegawa et al., 1991) were sensory
disturbances in lower extremities.
The four patients studied here and six other cases in the present family had visual
cloudiness due to vitreous opacities at an early stage. Vitreous opacities caused by amyloid
deposits were reported in patients with hereditary amyloid poly neuropathy (Kaufman,
1958; Kaufman and Thomas, 1959) and were seen in the advanced Portuguese cases
(Coutinho et al., 1980), but not in the 375 patients in the Japanese series of type I FAP
(Araki et al., 1980). The prevalence of vitreous opacities in the Swedish type I FAP
patients was about 10% (Sandgren et al., 1990). The presence of vitreous opacities
is one of the cardinal manifestations in three other kindreds: the Jewish type with
TTRDe33 (Pras et al., 1983; Nakazato et al., 1984); the type E FAP with TTR**84
(Rukavina etai, 1956; Nichols etal, 1989); the Italian FAP cases with TTRAla49
(Salvi etal, 1991).
Peripheral nerve involvement
In our patients, sensory impairment began in the distal part of the lower limbs and
progressed in an ascending fashion. It was mild in the upper limbs even in the advanced
stage. Severe impairment of temperature and pain sensations developed at the early stage,
but vibratory and position senses were far less impaired even at the advanced stage.
This pattern has commonly occurred in type I FAP. It has been suggested that preferential
loss of unmyelinated and small myelinated axons correlated with the selective impairment
of pain and temperature sensations as well as autonomic function (Dyck and Lambert,
1969; Thomas and King, 1974).
Lumbar pain, Lasegue's sign and segmental sensory loss appeared in our patients
at an early stage. These signs and symptoms suggested the involvement of the proximal
part of peripheral nerves. In fact, the post-mortem examination showed massive amyloid
deposits in the proximal portion of the sciatic nerve even in the cases with minimal
deposits in the sural nerve. Hanyu et al. (1989) reported heavy amyloid deposition in
the proximal portion of the sciatic nerve in autopsied cases of type I FAP, but amyloid
deposition was scanty in the sural nerve in spite of the total loss of myelinated nerve

fibres. Sobue et al. (1990) also observed prominent amyloid deposits in the dorsal root
ganglia, sympathetic ganglia and the most proximal part of the nerve fibres. All these
findings support the notion that amyloid deposits in the most proximal portion of the
nerve trunk are important in the pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathy in FAP and may
be the cause of occasional failure to detect amyloid deposits in the sural nerve as we
experienced in Case FV-2.
Motor function was affected much less than the autonomic and sensory functions in
our patients. Conduction velocities of the motor nerves were only slightly reduced even
in the absence of evoked responses in the sensory nerves. Motor nerve function was
also better preserved in type I FAP in comparison to sensory nerve function. One possible
explanation is the difference in the degree of neural sprouting, since the axonal sprouts
were not prominent in the dorsal roots in spite of the severe fibre loss, while they were
significant in the ventral spinal roots (Sobue et al., 1990).
The mechanism for precipitation of variant TTR in the endoneurial space and its relation
to nerve fibre generation is uncertain. Andrade (1952) reported that in type I FAP neuronal
damage preceded amyloid deposition, suggesting that neuropathy was due to metabolic
derangement. However, Sobue et al. (1990) demonstrated a parallel between the
distribution of amyloid deposits and neuronal changes, suggesting that the physical
influence of the deposited amyloid fibrils was harmful to the nerve rather than the soluble
variant TTR itself.
Autonomic disturbances
In the four patients presented here, autonomic dysfunction occurred at an early stage
and posed a more serious problem for management than the sensory neuropathy, since
it was intractable and restricted ambulation. Falcao de Freitas et al. (1980) reported
disturbance of the cardiovascular autonomic system in the Portuguese patients with type
I FAP including postural hypotension, a low plasma level of noradrenaline both in the
supine and standing position, and a blunt response of the heart rate to atropine and Valsalva
manoeuvre. All or most of these abnormalities also existed in our patients. The result
of the Valsalva manoeuvre indicated impairment of the vagal efferent pathway. The
negligible effect of atropine reinforced this conclusion. Administration of noradrenaline
led to excessive increases in the heart rate and blood pressure, suggesting denervation
hypersensitivity of the a-adrenergic nervous system caused by presynaptic nerve
degeneration. However, one must be cautious in interpretation of the responsiveness
of the heart rate to various stimuli in the presence of cardiomyopathy. Chronic digestive
symptoms such as nausea, diarrhoea and constipation might have been caused by massive
amyloid deposition in the intestinal tract as detected by the histopathologic examination.
Central nervous system
There were no clinical signs suggestive of central nervous system (CNS) involvement
and no amyloid deposits were found in the autopsied brains. Some Japanese patients
with TTR "^-related FAP showed cerebellar ataxia and pyramidal tract signs (Ikeda
et al., 1987), but these patients apparently had two independent diseases, type I FAP
and a spinocerebellar degneration (Ikeda et al., 1991).

HEREDITARY AMYLOIDOSIS

1287

Cardiac involvement
Cardiac involvement was a cardinal feature of our kindred and responsible for sudden
death. Cardiac amyloidosis is classified into two types (Coelho and Pimental, 1961);
disturbance of rhythm/conduction and congestive heart failure. Our patients showed
no clinical sign of heart failure in the early or middle stage, but low voltage and myocardial
ischaemic patterns strongly suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis were recorded with the
electrocardiogram. Conduction and rhythm abnormalities were mild. In the advanced
stage, echocardiogram showed abnormal thickening of both left and right ventricular
walls and amyloid cardiomyopathy was confirmed at autopsy in three cases.
Renal involvement
The intensity of amyloid deposition and renal insufficiency may differ considerably
even among patients with the mutant gene encoding TTRMet3° (Andrade, 1952; Silvia
Horta et al., 1964; Andersson et al., 1970, 1976; Hofer and Anderson, 1975; Benson
and Cohen, 1977; Ikeda et al., 1987). Our deceased patients (Cases IV-2, V-2, V-6)
had well preserved renal function and one patient (Case V-9) has not shown signs of
nephropathy. There were only small amounts of amyloid deposits in the perivascular
area and rarely in the cortex and medulla at autopsy.
Low serum TTR and elevated CSF protein levels
Serum TTR levels were reduced in our patients. Low TTR levels were also present
in Japanese type I FAP (Shoji and Nakagawa, 1988), Portuguese type I FAP and Indian
Maryland FAP (Benson and Dwulet, 1983). Although the mechanisms for the reduction
of serum TTR is not certain, TTR synthesis was unlikely to be reduced since the TTR
mRNA level in livers of patients with FAP was not appreciably different from controls
(Mita et al., 1986).
A major proportion of TTR in the CSF is produced in the choroid plexus. The release
of TTR from the choroid plexus was enhanced in the Japanese patients with type I FAP
(Mita et al., 1986). However, the level of the B-CSF barrier independent TTR in CSF
gradually declined in our patient (Case V-6) over 2 yrs. The latter may be explained
by consumption of TTR in the intrathecal space as amyloid fibrils, or by compensatory
enhancement of TTR synthesis in the choroid plexus at an early stage.
The kindred presented here originated in the Kunimi, Nagasaki Prefecture, but no
focus has been located there. This mutation may occur less frequently than the
TTRMa3° mutation or it might have occurred in the relatively recent past. The patients
presented here, though genetically different, were not clinically distinct from the patients
with TTRMct30-related type I FAP because of the considerable clinical heterogeneity of
the latter reported from many countries. Further studies of a large series of patients
over a long period are necessary to ascertain the relationship between the gene mutation
and clinical phenotypic expression.
