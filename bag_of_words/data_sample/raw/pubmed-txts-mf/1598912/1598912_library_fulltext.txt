Summary

Inadequate androgen action in genetic and gonadal males causes an intersex phenotype. We have analyzed
the androgen receptor (AR) gene in male pseudohermaphrodites with normal specific binding of dihydrotestosterone in their genital skin fibroblasts. In five patients with Reifenstein syndrome we have detected a point
mutation in the DNA binding domain. They are from two unrelated families and presented with perineoscrotal
hypospadias and undescended testes. After puberty they showed small testes, no palpable prostate, micropenis,
azoospermia, and gynecomastia. The mutation was discovered when cDNA fragments from three brothers
were sequenced. For rapid detection of the mutation in heterozygous and hemizygous carriers, allele-specific
PCRs and restriction-analysis techniques have been developed. Relatives of the patients, a group of normal
blood donors, and other patients were screened with these methods. Among 41 intersex patients with incomplete virilization, another two brothers presenting with this mutation were identified. The mutation is a
guanine-to-adenine transition at nucleotide 2314, which changes the alanine codon (GCC) immediately after
the first cysteine of the second zinc finger motif of the AR into a threonine codon (ACC). The mutation
was recreated in an AR expression vector, and wild-type as well as mutant ARs were expressed in COS-7 cells.
Cotransfection experiments were made using a mouse mammary tumor virus-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. The ability of the mutant receptor to stimulate transcription of the reporter gene was
reduced by about two-thirds, as compared with the wild-type receptor.
Introduction

Male sex differentiation and the development of a normal male phenotype depend on the secretion and action of fetal androgens (Jost 1970). Disturbances of
normal androgen physiology in genetic and gonadal
males result in defective virilization. The patients
affected cover the whole spectrum from phenotypical
females to patients with partial disorders and phenotypical males with infertility (Peres-Palacios et al.
1987; Griffin and Wilson 1989). The cardinal signs of
male intersexuality include severe hypospadias with
a perineoscrotal meatus frequently associated with a

bifid scrotum, microphallus, small gonads, and cryptorchidism.
The different syndromes of hereditary male pseudohermaphroditism result either from deficient or delayed testosterone (T) secretion or from unresponsiveness of the target tissue to androgens (Griffin and
Wilson 1989). A defective conversion of T to the more
active androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by means
of 5a-reductase results in pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias (Imperato-McGinley et al. 1974). Patients who lack the specific binding sites for androgens
in their target tissues suffer from the so-called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, and patients
with the X-linked Reifenstein syndrome often show
quantitative and/or qualitative abnormalities of specific androgen binding and present with incomplete
virilization (Hughes and Evans 1987; Peres-Palacios
et al. 1987). On the other hand, there are patients with
genital ambiguity who show normal specific binding

Mutation in Androgen Receptor in Reifenstein Syndrome

of androgens (receptor-positive androgen resistance).
This may be caused by defects affecting an androgenaction step beyond the specific binding of the hormone
to its receptor, e.g., binding of the hormone-receptor
complex to the androgen-responsive elements.
The androgen-receptor (AR) gene is localized on the
long arm of the X chromosome and has eight exons
(Brown et al. 1989; Lubahn et al. 1990). Exon A
encodes the large N-terminal domain; exons B and C
encode the DNA-binding domain; and exons D-H
encode the ligand-binding domain. Investigations of
the AR gene in patients with androgen insensitivity
have identified mutations of the AR as the underlying
molecular defect (Marcelli et al. 1990, 1991; Lubahn
et al. 1990; Ris-Stalpers et al. 1990; Sai et al. 1990;
McPhaul et al. 1991a, 1991b). We started to analyze
the AR gene in patients with perineoscrotal hypospadias. In five Reifenstein syndrome patients from two
unrelated families we detected a point mutation in the
second zinc finger motif of the DNA binding domain
of the AR.
Patients and Methods
Patients

The three surviving brothers of family N. - and also
a fourth brother, who later died in an accident -were
admitted to our department in their childhood, with
perineoscrotal hypospadias and undescended testes.
They had a normal male karyotype (46,XY). Their
external genitalia were corrected by staged surgery
and orchidopexy. Examination at 12, 15, and 18
years of age revealed incomplete virilization in the two
postpubertal brothers, with flaccid phalli 2.5 and 3
cm in length, two small (1 ml) scrotally fixed testes,
no palpable prostate, no ejaculate volume, and gynecomastia. In these two boys T serum levels were normal, whereas LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH
(follicle-stimulating hormone) serum levels were increased. T levels were 7.4 and 5.4 ng/ml (normal
range 3-9 ng/ml), FSH levels were 51 and 71 mU/ml
(normal range 1-14 mU/ml), and LH levels were 24
and 27 mU/ml (normal range 1.5-9.2 mU/ml). At
the time of follow-up, fibroblasts were cultured from
scrotal skin biopsies. Blood samples from the mother
and sister of the patients, as well as from a maternal
aunt and a maternal uncle, were obtained for analysis.
In addition, skin fibroblasts from the mother were
cultured and investigated.
The two brothers of family U. showed similar clinical characteristics. They also presented with perineo-

1319

scrotal hypospadias and undescended testes. A correction of the penis was performed at the age of 2 years
in one brother and at the age of 12 years in the other
brother. Reevaluation at 19 and 29 years of age revealed intersex disorders including micropenis, no palpable prostate, gynecomastia, female pubic escutcheon, small (1 ml) testes, and azoospermia. FSH levels
(39 and 26 mU/ml) and LH levels (12.8 and 11.6
mU/ml) were increased. Serum T level was normal in
one of them (4.5 ng/ml), whereas it was slightly above
the upper-normal level in the other one (9.7 ng/ml).
Blood samples from these two brothers, as well as
from their mother, were obtained for analysis.
Methods

Specific binding of DHT.-Genital skin fibroblasts
were cultured in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS.
Cells were grown to confluency, and, 24 h before the
assay, medium was replaced with DMEM without
FCS. Specific binding of 3H-DHT was determined by
the dispersed-cell assay according to Terakawa et al.
(1990), with the following modifications: Following
incubation with 3H-DHT for 1 h at 37°C, the cells
were extracted in a high-salt buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl,
1.5 mM EDTA, 0.55 M KCl, pH 7.4), unbound radioactivity was separated with the help of dextrancoated charcoal, and the samples were counted in a
liquid scintillation counter. Maximum binding and
dissociation constants were determined by means of
Scatchard plots. The maximum binding sites were related to the amount of protein.
Thermostability of DHT binding. - In order to determine
the best temperature for this test, specific binding was
measured in fibroblasts derived from a normal male at
37°C, 41 °C, and 420C, by means of the dispersed-cell
assay. Compared with that at 370C, specific binding
was slightly lower at 41 °C and decreased to 40%50% at 420C. Therefore a temperature of 41 °C was
chosen to test the thermostability of DHT binding.
Genital skin fibroblasts from the patients and from
three normal males were incubated with 1.5 mM of
3H-DHT (total binding) and with 1.5 nM of 3H-DHT
plus a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled DHT (unspecific binding), at 370C and 410C. After 1 h the
cells were pelleted, and samples were extracted and
counted as described above. Specifically bound DHT
was calculated for both temperatures, and the amount
bound at 41 °C was expressed as a percentage of the
amount bound at 37°C.
Sa-Reductase activity. - Sa-reductase activity was de-

1320
termined in cell-free fibroblast extracts by measuring
the conversion of I4C-T to DHT, at a substrate concentration of 100 nM, according to the method of Leshin
et al. (1978).
RNA isolation and reverse transcription. -Total RNA
was isolated from fibroblasts by the guanidine thiocya-

nate-acid phenol extraction method (Chirgwin et al.
1979) and was reversely transcribed to cDNA by
AMV reverse transcriptase and random hexanucleotide primers. About 0.2-0.5 jig of total RNA, 200
pmol of hexanucleotide primers, 10 units of AMV
reverse transcriptase, and 50 units of RNase inhibitor
were incubated in a total volume of 40 jl of AMV
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.3 at 42°C], 50 mM
KC1, 8 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mg BSA/ml, 1 mM of each
dNTP) for 8 min at 200C, followed by 8 min at 250C
and 30 min at 420C. The reaction was stopped by
boiling the sample for 2 min and cooling it on ice
afterward.
PCR amplification of AR cDNA.-Three overlapping
AR cDNA fragments (depicted in fig. 1) were amplified by PCR with the following primer pairs: IAR457/21 (5'CTGTTGAACTCTTCTGAGCAA3')
and AR1863 /21 as (5'ACACGGTCCATACAACTGGCC3'), II-AR1829/22 (5'TCACAGCCGAAGAAGGCCAGTT3') AR2474/22as (5'GTGGTGCTGGAAGCCTCTCCTT3'); and III-AR2113 / 19
(5'AGCTACTCCGGACCTTACG3') and AR3350/
25as (5'ACAGGCAGAAGAGATCTGAAAGGG3').
The first number of the oligonucleotide primers indicates the 5' nucleotide position on the AR cDNA
(Chang et al. 1988), and the second number represents
the length of the primers. "As" indicates primers on
the antisense strand. A 2.5-jl portion of cDNA solution and 47.5 jl of PCR mix (10 mM of Tris-HCI pH
9.0, 50 mM KCI, 0.1 mg gelatin/ml, 0.1% Triton
X-100, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.25 jM of each
primer, 25 units Taq Polymerase/ml) were mixed,
overlaid with 30 jl of mineral oil, and incubated in
a thermocycler. Thirty cycles were performed with
strand separation for 45 s at 94°C, followed by 15 s
at 96°C, annealing for 1 min at 55°C, and DNA synthesis for 1.5 min at 73° C. For the amplification of
fragments I and II, 2% and 4% dimethylsulfoxide,
respectively, was added to the PCR mix to lower the
strand separation temperature, because these fragments contain regions with extremely high GC content
and could not be amplified under standard conditions.
PCR amplification of genomic DNA. -DNA was isolated from either fibroblast cells or whole blood by

1Kocker et al.

phenol-chloroform extraction. The cell pellet or 100

gl blood was lysed in 500 il buffer (4 M guanidine
thiocyanate, 0.5% sodium-N-lauroyl-sarcosine, 25
mM sodium citrate pH 7.0, 0.1 M P-mercaptoetha-

nol) and was extracted with 600 jil phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol (25:24:1). The DNA was precipitated with isopropanol, pelleted by centrifugation,
washed with 75 % ethanol, and dissolved in TE buffer.
From about 0.1 gg of DNA a 0.4-kb DNA fragment
containing the third exon (exon C) of the AR gene
was amplified with two primers annealing within the
flanking introns (Lubahn et al. 1990). PCR conditions
were the same as those described for cDNA fragments.
DNA sequencing. - An automated sequencer was used
for direct sequencing of the PCR fragments by the
dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using
fluorescent labels. From each fragment, overlapping
single-strand fragments were synthesized from the
coding strand, as well as from the noncoding strand,
by asymmetric PCR using one primer at a concentration of 0.25 jiM and the other one at a concentration
of 0.015 gM. Single-strand fragments were purified
by ion-exchange columns and were sequenced with
Taq polymerase sequencing kits, according to the protocols of the supplier (Applied Biosystems). PCR fragments III were sequenced with dye primer kits using
the universal primer M13-21, whereas PCR fragments
I and II, as well as exon C fragments, were sequenced
with dye terminator kits using AR-specific primers.
When primer sequencing kits were utilized, the universal Ml 3 primer sequence was introduced into the fragments during the asymmetric PCR by using one primer
elongated with the universal primer sequence at the 5'
end. The region encoding the glycine repeat of the
N-terminal domain in cDNA fragments II could not
be sequenced unequivocally, and the exact number of
glycine repeats could not be determined. The number
of glutamine repeats in the N-terminal cDNA fragments of our patients and two normal males is 21.
Screening for the G-o-A2314 mutation. -For rapid detection of the mutant gene, an allele-specific PCR technique and a restriction-analysis method have been developed. Two allele-specific primers were chosen in
such a way that their 3' ends-the starting points of
the DNA polymerase -anneal at the site of the mutation (fig. 4). Both primers have a mismatch at the third
nucleotide from the 3' end (A instead of the correct
matching G). This mismatch increases the specificity
of the reaction. When the normal AR sequence is present, the oligonucleotide AR 2299/18 (5'AACAGA-

Mutation in Androgen Receptor in Reifenstein Syndrome

AGTACCTGTACG3') yields PCR fragments, whereas,
in case of mutation, PCR fragments are obtained with
the oligonucleotide AR2299/18M (5'AACAGAAGTACCTGTACA3'). In both PCRs the second primer
is the downstream primer of the exon C fragment. The
PCRs were performed under the following conditions:
strand separation for 45 s at 940C followed by 15 s
at 950C, annealing for 75 s at 480C, and DNA synthesis for 30 s at 730C. After 30 cycles, 10 p1 of the
sample were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel.
Discrimination by restriction analysis was achieved
with the restriction enzymes CfoI and Snol (fig. 4).
CfoI (GCGC) only cuts the normal exon C fragment,
whereas SnoI (GTGCAC) only cuts the exon C fragment carrying the mutation.
Introduction of the mutation into an AR expression vector. -

A HindIII-AspI fragment (286 bp) containing the mutation was isolated from a PCR-cDNA fragment III of
one of the patients and was replaced in the expression
vector HAOa. HAOa contains the human AR open
reading frame cloned into the BamHI site of the eucaryotic expression vector pSG-5 (Green et al. 1988)
and was provided by Dr. A. C. B. Cato of Karlsruhe.
The resulting expression vector HAOa-M2314 was
analyzed by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing.
Transient AR expression in COS-7 cells.-Either wildtype or mutant AR expression vectors and the transfection efficiency control plasmid pSV-Ogal were cotransfected into COS-7 cells by electroporation. A 15-g
portion of AR expression plasmid and 2 gg of 3-galactosidase expression plasmid were mixed with about 3
x 106 COS-7 cells in 200 jl of HBS buffer (20 mM
HEPES, 154 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCI, 0.7 mM
Na2HPO4, 6 mM glucose, pH 7.05), and an electrical
discharge was applied by an electroporation system
(BioRad; settings were 150 V, 500 iF, resistance co)
in a 2-mm electrode cuvette. The cells were suspended
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and were
grown for 45 h, with one medium renewal after 16 h.
Cells were harvested by trypsin digestion and were
suspended in DMEM supplemented with 25 mM
HEPES pH 7.2. Duplicate samples were incubated
with 5 nM 3H-methyltrienolone (R1 881) in the presence or absence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled R1881 for 1 h at 370C. Instead of DHT, R1881
was used in these experiments, to prevent metabolization of the androgen during incubation. Specific binding was measured according to the method described
for determination of specific binding of DHT in fibroblasts. An aliquot of the cells was lysed in 0-galac-

1321

tosidase buffer by ultrasonication, and 3-galactosidase
activity was determined by a photometric assay (Sambrook et al. 1989) to monitor transformation efficiency.
Cotransfection experiments. -Either wild-type or mu-

tant AR expression vectors were introduced into
COS-7 cells by electroporation, together with the reporter plasmid pHC-wt (Cato et al. 1988), and induction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression by DHT was measured. The reporter plasmid
contains the CAT gene under the control of the
hormone-inducible promoter from the long-terminal
repeat (LTR) of the mouse mammary tumor virus
(MMTV). A 30-gg portion of reporter plasmid and 3
gg of AR expression vector were mixed with about
6 x 106 COS-7 cells in 100 pl of HBS buffer, and
an electrical discharge was applied (Biometra; settings
were 150 V, 300 gF, resistance 00) in a 2-mm electrode
cuvette. The cells were suspended in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% charcoal-stripped FCS and were
distributed into six culture wells (0 = 3 cm). After
incubation for 15 h the medium was renewed, 40 nM
(end concentration) of DHT was added to three of the
wells, and incubation was continued for 24 h. The
cells were harvested, pelleted by centrifugation, and
extracted with 100 gl of 0.3 M Tris.HCI pH 7.0 by
ultrasonication. CAT activity in the cell extract was
determined by a mixed-phase assay (Nielson et al.
1989). Background level was measured in the cell extract of mock-transfected fibroblasts and was subtracted from the samples.
Results

Specific Binding of DHT, and Sa-Reductase Activity in
Genital Skin Fibroblasts

The genital skin fibroblasts derived from the three
brothers N. were incubated with increasing amounts
of 3H-DHT, and specific binding of DHT was determined by Scatchard plot analysis (table 1). The dissociation constants (KD) were 0.1,0.2, and 0.1 nM, and
in the maximum binding capacities (Bmax) were 22,61,
and 65 fmol/mg of protein. Fibroblasts derived from
the foreskin of males who underwent circumcision
showed dissociation constants of 0.1-0.3 nM and
maximum binding capacities of 21-138 fmol/mg of
protein. This shows that the patients' ARs bind DHT
with normal affinity and that maximum binding is
within the range for normal males. The thermostabil-

ity of DHT binding was also investigated. Specific
binding was determined at 370C and at 41 0C. In the
patients' fibroblasts, specific binding at 410C was
79%, 86%, and 85% of the specific binding at 370C
(table 1). This was not different from the results for
control fibroblasts, in which specific binding at 41 IC
was 74%-101%. Sa-Reductase activity was determined by measuring the conversion of T to DHT in
cell-free extracts. The fibroblasts of the three brothers
showed normal 5a-reductase activity.

Subsequently, the fragments were sequenced directly with an automated DNA sequencer. In the three
brothers a G- A substitution was found at nucleotide
2314 (nucleotide numbering is according to Chang et
al. 1988) in the region encoding the DNA binding
domain. This point mutation changes the alanine triplet (GCC) immediately after the first cysteine of the
second zinc finger motif into a threonine triplet (ACC)

Sequencing of AR cDNA
Total RNA was isolated from the fibroblasts of the
three brothers N. and was reverse transcribed to
cDNA. Three overlapping cDNA fragments that cover
the entire coding region were amplified by PCR (fig.
1). The fragments in 2% agarose gels were of the size
that could be expected from the AR cDNA sequence
and were not different from those of normal males,
which indicates that there are no large insertions or
deletions in the AR cDNA of the patients.

In order to confirm the mutation on the genomic
level as well, a fragment containing the third AR exon
(exon C), which encodes the second zinc finger, was
amplified from fibroblast DNA and was sequenced
(fig. 3). The mutation was present in the fragments of
each of the three brothers.

Screening for the G--oA23'4 Mutation by Allete-specific
Methods

For rapid detection ofthe mutation in other carriers,
two specific screening techniques that distinguish between normal and mutant AR genes were developed:
an allele-specific PCR and an allele-specific restriction
analysis of the exon C genomic fragment. These techniques were used to analyze relatives of the patients,
a group of 105 normal individuals, and other intersex
patients presenting with a wide range of incomplete

virilization.
Since the AR gene is located on the X chromosome
(Brown et al. 1989), the three patients must have inherited the mutant gene from their mother. Therefore,
DNA was isolated from her blood and was analyzed.
The allele-specific PCRs, as well as the restriction analysis, revealed that she is heterozygous and has a mutant as well as a normal AR gene (fig. 4). This was
confirmed by sequencing her exon C fragment. As
shown in figure 3, a G signal and an A signal were

1323

obtained at the position of the mutation. The sister of
the three patients also carries the mutant gene and is
heterozygous, whereas a maternal uncle and a maternal aunt have the normal AR gene only (fig. 4).
The group of normal individuals included 61 males
and 44 females. DNA isolated from the blood of these
persons was analyzed with the allele-specific PCR
technique. In all of them, only the normal AR gene was
identified, which indicates that the AR gene present in
the three brothers is probably not a rare normal AR
allele.
Among the 41 intersex patients who were screened
for the mutation, another two brothers (family U.)
with the G--A2314 mutation were detected (fig. 4).
They also presented with Reifenstein syndrome. Their
clinical symptoms as well as their endocrine status
were almost identical to those found in the three brothers of family N. Their mutation was confirmed by
isolating and sequencing the AR exon C genomic fragment and by analyzing the DNA of their mother. As
in family N., the mother was found to be heterozygous
(fig. 4). All the other intersex patients investigated had
the normal G nucleotide at site 2314.
The two families with this AR mutation are obviously not related. In their histories there are no indications of a possible common maternal ancestry. For at
least four generations their members have come from
different places - members of family N. from the Austrian part of the Tyrol and members of family U. from
the Italian part of the Tyrol. Nor is there any reported
history of hypospadias in the maternal ancestors of
both families.
Transient Expression of AR in COS-7 Cells, and Induction
of a Hormone-inducible Promoter in Cotransfection
Experiments

The mutation is within a 286-bp HindIII-AspI restriction fragment. This fragment was isolated from
cDNA of one of the patients and was replaced in the
AR expression vector HAOa. The ability of both
HAOa and the resulting expression vector HAOaM2314 to induce expression of functionally active AR
was tested by determination of androgen binding after
transient expression of wild-type or mutant AR in
COS-7 cells. Either wild-type or mutant expression
vectors were transfected into the cells by electroporation together with a transfection-efficiency control
plasmid. After incubation for 45 h, specific binding of
the androgen methyltrienolone (R1881) and 13-galactosidase activity expressed from the control plasmid
were measured. The synthetic androgen R1881 was

isolated from fibroblasts or whole blood, and two PCRs were performed with the primers indicated at the top of the panel. The first PCR
(left lane of each sample) yielded a fragment with the normal AR gene, while the second one (right lane of each sample) yielded a fragment
with the mutated AR gene. A 10-p1 aliquot of each reaction was separated on a 2% agarose gel, and the fragments were visualized by
ethidium bromide staining. 1 = Normal male; 2-7 = family N. (2-4 = the three affected brothers; 5 = mother; 6 = maternal aunt; and

used instead of DHT, to minimize metabolization during incubation. Cells transfected with wild-type AR
expression vector specifically bound 379 fmol R1 88 1 /
mg protein, and cells transfected with mutant AR expression vector bound 406 fmol R1881 /mg protein
(fig. SA). Thus the levels of AR expressed in transfected cells were very similar for both expression vectors. Transfection efficiencies also were similar, as indicated by the 3-galactosidase activities (304 vs. 271
mU).

In order to test the ability of the mutant receptor to
activate a hormone-dependent promoter, either wildtype or mutant AR expression vectors were cotransfected into COS-7 cells, together with a reporter plasmid, and the induction of CAT expression by DHT
was determined (fig. SB). The reporter plasmid contained a CAT gene controlled by the hormone-inducible promoter from the LTR of the MMTV virus.
A 7.7-fold increase in CAT expression was induced
by DHT when the wild-type AR was coexpressed with

Discussion

Defective virilization in genetic and gonadal males
results from inadequate androgen action. In addition
to reduced synthesis of T and DHT, qualitative and
quantitative abnormalities of the intracellular hormone-binding sites, as well as post-ligand-binding defects, are responsible for intersex phenotypes. In some
patients with complete testicular feminization, point
mutations in the hormone-binding domain of the AR
that result in a loss of hormone-binding ability were

1325

identified as the underlying molecular defect (Lubahn
et al. 1990; Marcelli et al. 1990; Ris-Stalpers et al.
1990; Sai et al. 1990; McPhaul et al. 1991b).
Binding assays can only evaluate the first step of
androgen action - i.e., the binding of androgens to the
receptor-and cannot evaluate the subsequent steps
of signal transduction. We therefore started to analyze, by means of molecular-biological techniques,
male patients who presented with severe malformations of the external genitalia despite normal specific
binding of DHT. In three brothers with Reifenstein
syndrome a point mutation that leads to the substitution of one amino acid in the AR DNA binding domain
was detected. We have developed allele-specific assays
that allow rapid detection of this mutation in heterozygous and hemizygous carriers. With the help of these
methods the same mutation was found in another two
brothers suffering from Reifenstein syndrome. The
clinical symptoms of the patients of both families are
almost identical. They include perineoscrotal hypospadias, undescended testes, gynecomastia, azoospermia, no palpable prostate, and elevated levels of FSH
and LH. The mutations seem to have occurred independently in both families, since their histories do not
indicate a common maternal ancestry.
The patients have inherited the mutant gene from
their mothers, who are heterozygous and carry a normal as well as a mutant gene. A sister of the patients
also carries the mutant gene and is heterozygous. A
maternal aunt and a phenotypically normal maternal
uncle, as well as all 105 phenotypically normal individuals who were analyzed, carried the normal gene
only. This indicates that the mutation detected in our
patients is not a rare normal AR allele but indeed is
associated with defective virilization.
The G2314--A mutation occurred in the region between the first and second cysteine of the second zinc
finger motif of the DNA binding domain, which is
the site of interaction between the hormone-receptor
complex and the androgen-responsive element. Binding of DHT to the receptor -the first step of androgen
action - seems not to be affected. The mutant receptor
has a normal ability to bind DHT, and the thermostability of the receptor-DHT complex is also normal. As
shown by the cotransfection experiment the mutation
reduces the ability of the AR to stimulate transcription
from a hormone-inducible promoter. The remaining
transactivation activity of the mutant receptor is approximately one-third that of the wild-type receptor.
This is in good agreement with the clinical findings
indicating that the response to androgens is strongly

reduced in the patients but not completely absent. The
mutation described in the present report is different
from AR mutations in the hormone-binding region
found in patients with complete androgen insensitivity. Whereas these mutations prevent hormone binding to the receptor and result in a female phenotype,
the mutation detected in our patients affects a step
beyond hormone binding and leads to a partial reduction of androgen function, which results in incomplete
virilization in patients with a male gender.
Another mutation in the second zinc finger of the
AR has been described by Marcelli et al. (1991). That
mutation leads to replacement of the third amino acid
after the last cysteine of the zinc finger and results
in a loss of AR function. Consequently, the affected
patient shows complete testicular feminization.
The region in which the mutation occurred is highly
conserved among the members of the steroid-receptor
family and is invariably present in the AR of several
species (Carson-Jurica et al. 1990; He et al. 1990).
In vitro mutagenesis experiments and analyses of the
three-dimensional structure of steroid hormone receptors showed that this region is essential for correct
discrimination between different hormone-responsive
elements, as well as for protein-protein interaction
(Umesono and Evans 1989; Hard et al. 1990;
Schwabe et al. 1990). All steroid receptors except the
estrogen receptor have an alanine at the site corresponding to the site of the mutation in the AR of our
patients. In the glucocorticoid receptor this alanine is
involved in receptor dimerization (Liusi et al. 1991).
The mutation introduces an additional polar OHgroup at this site by exchanging alanine with threonine
and thereby probably affects protein-protein interactions.
Identification of the molecular mechanisms that
cause the various forms of sex ambiguity will greatly
improve diagnosis and therapy in affected patients.
Until recently little was known about defects affecting
the steps of androgen action that occur after hormone
binding. The AR mutation described here and the mutation described by Marcelli et al. (1991) are mutations of this kind. Rapid screening techniques such as
the allele-specific PCR described in the present report
allow early identification of known mutant AR genes
in affected families, both in patients and in phenotypically normal heterozygous carriers. This will facilitate
both diagnosis and genetic counseling.
The decision about sex assignment in intersex patients should be made immediately after birth, to ensure normal psychosexual orientation and develop-

ment of the child. Since all male individuals with the
Ala--Thr mutation who are described in the present
study have severe malformations of the external genitalia and-despite surgical corrections-exhibit a severe form of intersexuality after puberty, newborns
with this mutation should be raised as females and
should undergo feminizing genitoplasty as early as
possible.
