Inadequate androgen action in genetic and gonadal males causes an intersex phenotype. We have analyzed the androgen receptor (AR) gene in male pseudohermaphrodites with normal specific binding of dihydrotestosterone in their genital skin fibroblasts. In five patients with Reifenstein syndrome we have detected a point mutation in the DNA binding domain. They are from two unrelated families and presented with perineoscrotal hypospadias and undescended testes. After puberty they showed small testes, no palpable prostate, micropenis, azoospermia, and gynecomastia. The mutation was discovered when cDNA fragments from three brothers were sequenced. For rapid detection of the mutation in heterozygous and hemizygous carriers, allele-specific PCRs and restriction-analysis techniques have been developed. Relatives of the patients, a group of normal blood donors, and other patients were screened with these methods. Among 41 intersex patients with incomplete virilization, another two brothers presenting with this mutation were identified. The mutation is a guanine-to-adenine transition at nucleotide 2314, which changes the alanine codon (GCC) immediately after the first cysteine of the second zinc finger motif of the AR into a threonine codon (ACC). The mutation was recreated in an AR expression vector, and wild-type as well as mutant ARs were expressed in COS-7 cells. Cotransfection experiments were made using a mouse mammary tumor virus-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. The ability of the mutant receptor to stimulate transcription of the reporter gene was reduced by about two-thirds, as compared with the wild-type receptor.
