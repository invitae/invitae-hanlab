The ovarian follicles of 23 of 33 women undergoing elective pelvic laparotomy during menstrual cycle days 11 to 17 were aspirated by a low-vacuum device. The study compared the ovulatory status of women in midcycle with the health of the oocytes obtained, and determined the frequency of recovery of mature oocytes without the preadministration of exogenous hormones. Maturing or mature oocytes were obtained from 22% and nonmature oocytes from 48% of the 23 women. Sixty per cent of the women in each of the maturing or mature and nonmature groups were postovulatory as judged by evaluation of the endometrial and ovarian tissue recovered. Furthermore, 20% of the maturing or mature oocytes and 65% of the nonmature oocytes showed a moderately heavy amount of cytoplasmic degeneration, which was independent of ovulatory status. Therefore, it is concluded that, because of the relatively low rate of return of oocytes, the frequent postovulatory status of patients in midcycle, and uncertainty about the viability of the oocytes so obtained, women not stimulated by exogenous hormones are ill-suited for recovery of maturing or mature follicular oocytes for in vitro fertilization studies.
