INTRODUCTION
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inherited deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase,
which untreated causes severe, irreversible mental retardation (Scriver et al., 1989). Neonatal screening programs based on determination of phenylalanine in the
blood (Guthrie and Susi, 1963) have been implemented
throughout the world, except for some countries in the

Third World, and form the basis for dietary therapy.
Within the first decade of screening for neonatal hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) it became clear that H P A due
to phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous (Woolf, 1971).
The question of whether dietary management should
be initiated in all hyperphenylalaninemic neonates
arose when it was recognized that children with serum
phenylalanine concentrations below 600 #mol/liter
(non-PKU HPA) appear to show normal intellectual
and behavioral development without treatment (Woolf
et al., 1961; Levy et al., 1971). Some neonates with nonP K U H P A present with serum phenylalanine values
above 600 #mol/liter (O'Flynn et al., 1967; Castells et al.,
1968; Gfittler and Wamberg, 1972; Gfittler, 1980). A 24-h
phenylalanine load test at 6 months of age will eventually classify the children as having n o n - P K U H P A not
needing therapy (Grittier, 1971). Initiation of dietary
therapy soon after birth has important psychological
and social implications (Mikkelsen et al., 1974). Therefore, it is imperative as early as possible to determine
whether a newborn child requires a phenylalanine-restricted diet (PKU) or not (non-PKU HPA).
Today much is known about the molecular basis for
the phenotypic diversity of P K U (Giittler et al., 1987;
Okano et al., 1991). Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotypes associated with nonP K U H P A alleles have been described in 13 n o n - P K U
H P A families (DiSilvestre et al., 1990), and more recent
R F L P haplotype studies suggest that n o n - P K U H P A
may result from compound heterozygosity for a P K U
allele and an allele supposed to harbor a mutation with a
milder effect (Avigad et al., 1991).
The present study demonstrates that in 17 families
with n o n - P K U HPA, 12 children had in fact inherited
one of the common P K U mutations. Screening for mutations in individual exons of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
in combination with single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) (Orita et al., 1989) revealed two new
mutations in four of these children. The tyrosine response following a phenylalanine loading suggests than
n o n - P K U H P A results from mutant heterozygosity for a
codominantly expressed P K U allele and a mutation that
has less effect on phenylalanine hydroxylase activity.

Patients. Non-PKU HPA newborns were detected among approximately one million neonates screened for blood phenylalanine at Days
5-7 of life, born in Denmark from 1975 through 1990. The cutoff value
for follow-up testing is 150 ttmol/liter. The children were diagnosed to
have non-PKU HPA when blood phenylalanine levels persistently
remained below 600 #mol/liter either from the neonatal period or
within the first 12-18 months of life on a normal dietary intake of
protein, and when no other reasons for hyperphenylalaninemia could
be demonstrated (see Gfittler, 1980; Gfittler et al., 1992). In addition, a
phenylalanine load test dose of 0.1 g phenylalanine/kg body wt must
be eliminated within 24 h of the loading, with a tyrosine response
showing either no or a slight increase in blood tyrosine within the first
hour of the load (Giittler and Wamberg, 1977; Giittler, 1980).
Clinical chemical analysis. Neonatal screening for blood phenylalanine was performed with the Guthrie microbiological assay at the
State Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark. Serum phenylalanine
as well as serum tyrosine was confirmed fluorometrically (Grittier,
1980). Blood amino acids were analyzed by ion-exchange chromatography (Gfittler et al., 1978). Pterines in the urine were determined by
HPLC (Niederwieser et al., 1980), and dihydropteridine reductase activity in cultured fibroblasts as previously described (Giittler et al.,
1977).
A phenylalanine load was given to the fasting individual as a pure
solution (fully dissolved by sonication in 0.01 mol/liter HC1 to give a
final concentration of 173 mmol/liter and pH 3.8), and blood specimens for analysis of phenylalanine and tyrosine were obtained 0, 15,
30, 45, and 60 min and 2, 3, 4, and 24 h after intake of 0.1 g phenylalanine/kg body wt. The tyrosine response to an oral phenylalanine load
is not affected by gender, and females were loaded when not using oral
contraceptives. The intraindividual variation was approximately 8%
(Giittler, 1980).
Genomic D N A analysis. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood
leukocytes, and RFLP haplotyping was performed as previously described (Grittier and Woo, 1985; Chakraborty et al., 1987).
Allele-specific oligonucleotide probing. Individual exons and flanking intronic sequences of the PAH gene were enzymatically amplified
by PCR (Saiki et al., 1985). Primers for amplification of exons 5, 7, 9,
and 12 have been described elsewhere (Okano et al., 1990; Hofman et
al., 1989; DiLella et al., 1988). One-half microgram genomic DNA was
included in a 25-td PCR mixture containing deoxynucleoside triphosphates (50 ttM each), 10 pmol each of the appropriate primers, 10 mM
Tris-HC1 (pH 8.3), 50 mM KC1, 1.5 mM MgClz, 0.01% gelatin, and 0.8
U of AmpliTaq (Perkin-Elmer/Cetus). Amplification consisted of 30
cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s using a PerkinElmer/Cetus Thermal Cycler. An aliquot (1 #l) of the reaction mixture was applied to a Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad) in a dot-blot
apparatus. Allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) probes specific for
common mutant alleles were end-labeled with [~,-z2p]dATP, and procedures for hybridization and washing were as described (DiLella et
al., 1988).
P C R - S S C P analysis. For SSCP analysis, genomic DNA was amplified as described above, apart from the inclusion of 12.5 #Ci each of
[a-zsS]dATP and [a-zSS]dCTP (NEN) in the reaction. Ten microliters
of the amplification product was mixed with 40 ttl of 0.1% sodium
dodecyl sulfate and 10 mM EDTA, and an aliquot (3 ttl) was supplemented with an equal volume of 95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA,
0.05% bromophenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol. The samples were denatured at 80°C for 2 min, quenched on ice, and applied to a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 10% glycerol in 1x TBE (90 mM Tris-borate, pH 8.3, 4 mM EDTA). Electrophoresis was performed at 35 W for
5-6 h using a fan to provide cooling. The gel was dried and exposed
directly to Kodak XAR-5 film for 18-72 h at room temperature.
Direct D N A sequencing. For identification of mutations causing
conformation polymorphisms, genomic DNA was amplified as described above, except that the concentration of nucleotides was reduced to 8 ttM. The amplification product was sequenced directly
without purification using end-labeled amplification primers as sequencing primers (Wong et al., 1987).

alleles harboring m u t a t i o n s with a milder effect on phenylalanine hydroxylase activity (D415N, I306V) in three families with the nonP K U H P A phenotype.

the mutations described in the present paper is illustrated in Fig. 3. The parent heterozygous for the nonP K U HPA mutation (I306V) formed more tyrosine following a phenylalanine load of 0.1 g/kg body wt than the
parent heterozygous for the IVS-12 splicing mutation
causing classic P K U (Fig. 3). Their daughter, who had
inherited the I306V and IVS-12 mutations, responded
with no measurable increase in tyrosine (Fig. 3). However, she eliminated the phenylalanine load test dose
within 24 h (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
The present data on haplotype distribution in patients with non-PKU HPA are consistent with recently
published observations by DiSilvestre et al. (1990), who
found that a majority of the alleles segregating with nonP K U HPA were associated with haplotype 1 or 4. The
present haplotype data are also consistent with the data
recently published by Avigad et al. (1991), who demona

P K U (IVS-12) and in their n o n - P K U H P A child carrying both mutations.

strated that in 6 of 27 families with non-PKU HPA, the
affected child was a compound heterozygote for a haplotype associated with a classic P K U allele and a haplotype associated with an allele with an unknown mutation. Avigad et al. (1991) further demonstrated that in 2
of the 27 families a non-PKU HPA child had inherited a
mutation causing moderate or classic P K U (R261Q and
R408W, respectively).
The present study of 17 non-PKU HPA families revealed that 12 children had a P K U mutation on one
chromosome. In addition, we have identified two new
mutations in 4 of 6 patients who had inherited a classic
P K U mutation (IVS-12 or R408W). It is further demonstrated that the identified mutations (D415N in exon 12
and I306V in exon 9 of the PAH gene) have less impact
on the carriers' ability to hydroxylate phenylalanine to
tyrosine compared to the parents carrying a classic P K U
mutation. This may explain why the combined effect
causes non-PKU HPA.
Phenylalanine hydroxylase activity in liver biopsies of
patients with classic P K U is barely detectable, whereas
the activity in patients with non-PKU HPA is 5-10% of
normal (Friedman et al., 1973; Kaufman and Max, 1971;
Bartholom~ et al., 1975). In accordance with the in vitro
determinations of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity in
liver biopsies, we observed that serum tyrosine levels
either were unaffected (Fig. 3) or showed a slight increase within the first hour of a phenylalanine load in 12
children with non-PKU HPA, whereas serum tyrosine
decreased in 40 patients with classic P K U following phenylalanine loads (Gfittler and Hansen, 1977). The decrease in serum tyrosine following a phenylalanine load
in P K U patients may be explained by a sharp rise in
plasma insulin, and glucagon, which is detectable within
20 min of ingestion of the phenylalanine test dose
(Gfittler et al., 1978).
