Search for mutations
in pancreatic sufficient cystic fibrosis italian patients:
detection of 90% of molecular defects and identification
of three novel mutations
Received: 30 October 1994 / Revised 18 January 1995

A b s t r a c t A cohort of 31 cystic fibrosis patients showing
pancreatic sufficiency and bearing an unidentified mutation on at Least one chromosome was analyzed through
denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the whole coding region of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene, including intron-exon boundaries.
Three new and 19 previously described mutations were
detected. The combination of these with known mutations
detected by other methods, allowed the characterization
of mutations on 56/62 (90.3%) chromosomes. A m o n g
those identified, 17 can be considered responsible for pancreatic sufficiency, since they were found in patients carrying a severe mutation on the other chromosome. Among
these presumed mild mutations, eight were detected more
than once, R352Q being the most frequent in this sample
(4.83%). Intragenic microsatellite analysis revealed that
the six chromosomes still bearing unidentified mutations
are associated with five different haplotypes. This may indicate that these chromosomes bear different mutations,
rarely occurring among cystic fibrosis patients, further underlying the molecular heterogeneity of the genetic defects present in patients having pancreatic sufficiency.

Introduction
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common severe autosomal
recessive disorder among Caucasian populations, where

the incidence is estimated to be l in 2500 live births and
carrier frequency 1 in 25 (Boat et al. 1989). The gene responsible for the disease (Kerem et al, 1989; Rommens
et al. 1989; Riordan et al. 1989), encodes a 1480-amino
acid protein named cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is predicted to function
as a cAMP-regulated chloride channel (Anderson et al.
1991). Reduced chloride secretion is at the basis of insufficient hydration of ductural mucus in the airways, reproductive system and pancreas, leading to progressive obstructive damage (The Cystic Fibrosis Genotype-Phenotype Consortium 1993). The clinical expression of the disease is heterogenous but most patients with CF typically
present with chronic obstructive lung disease, elevated
electrolyte concentration in the sweat and insufficient
pancreatic exocrine function (pancreatic insufficiency or
PI). Approximately 10-15% of CF patients have pancreatic sufficiency (PS) (Shwachman 1975).
To date, over 470 mutations and sequence alterations
have been identified by the CF Genetic Analysis Consortium in regions of the CFTR gene coding for different
functional domains of the potypeptide chain. The main
mutation causing CF, AF508, a 3-bp deletion located in
exon 10 in the first nucleotide binding fold (NBF I)
(Kerem et al. 1989), has a frequency in patients ranging
from 30 to 88% in different populations (European Working Group on CF Genetics 1990).
A correlation between the mutations identified and the
clinical symptoms has been observed with pancreas status
(Corey et al. 1989; Kerem et al. 1990a), while severity of
lung involvement is not so clearly related to the CFTR
genotype, suggesting that this phenotype might be modulated by additional genetic or environmental lectors (The
Cystic Fibrosis Genotype-Phenotype Consortium 1993).
Pancreatic sufficient status is genetically determined by
mild mutations, mostly being missense, which have been
hypothesised to confer a higher residual CFTR activity
than the severe ones (Kerem et al. 1989).
Identifying the molecular defects associated with the PS
phenotype could be very useful in further clarifying the
role of the CFTR protein, and eventually in prognostic

313
evaluations and establishing care protocols. Furthermore,
searching for mutations in the group of patients with PS
m a y reveal the presence of some p r e d o m i n a n t mutations,
which should be preferentially tested.
Data available on the overall C F population, i n c l u d i n g
both PI and PS patients, indicate a high heterogeneity of
m o l e c u l a r defects. A few mutations have been so far associated with the PS phenotype (Tsui 1992; Kristidis et al.
1992), but no extensive m o l e c u l a r characterization focused on patients with PS has b e e n reported yet. We have
studied a cohort of 31 Italian patients with PS using firstly
traditional methods to screen for mutations which predominate in the Italian population [AF508, G 5 4 2 X (Kerem
et al. 1990b), N1303K (Osborne et al. 1991), 1717-1G--~A
(Guillermit et al. 1990) and W 1 2 8 2 X (Vidaud et al. 1990)],
secondly denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( D G G E )
analysis of the entire coding part of the C F T R gene, thirdly
testing for the presence of the two mutations [1811+
1.2kbA--+G (Chillon et al., personal c o m m u n i c a t i o n to the
C F Genetic Analysis C o n s o r t i u m ) and 3 8 4 9 + 1 0 k b C - + T
(Highsmith et al. 1994)] located in n o n - c o d i n g portions of
the gene, which were not detectable by D G G E , and finally
intragenic microsatellites [IVS8/GT (Morral et al. 1991),
I V S 1 7 b / T A a n d I V S 1 7 b / C A ( Z i e l e n s k i et al. 1991b)]
mapping.

Materials and methods

Pancreatic sufficiency was identified by fecal fat balance (3 days
fecal fat collection to calculate the absorption coefficient) (van der
Kamer et al. 1949) over 90% in all cases over age of 3 years, by
absence of steatorrhea measured with steatocrit (Phuapradit et al.
1981) in the only child under 3 years, and by pancreatic stimulation test (Durie et al. 1984) in three adult patients with sweat chloride in the borderline values.
Pulmonary status was evaluated as follows: (1) chest X-ray
scored according to Chrispin and Norman (CN) (1974) (0-38;
0 the best); (2) respiratory function was assessed by the following
indexes: forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume
in 1 s (FEV0 (Polgar and Promadhat 1971) expressed as a percentage of predicted values for height and sex; and (3) presence of
P. aeruginosa chronic lung infection.
Nutritional status was evaluated by the following parameters:
(1) weight and height centiles; and (2) Cole's index: percent of
ideal body weight predicted for height and sex.
All patients showed a normal growth without pancreatic supplementation.
Mutation detection
Screening for mutations which predominate in our population:
AF508, G542X, N1303K, 1717-1G---~A,W1282X, and of the two
intronic mutations 3849+10kbC--+T and 1811+l.2kbA---~G was
carried out as previously described (Ballabio et al. 1990; Friedman
et al. 1991; Cremonesi et al. 1991; Vidaud et al. 1990; Highsmith
et al. 1994; Chillon et al., personal communication to the CF Genetic Analysis Consortium).
DGGE analysis and direct sequencing

CF patients
DNA specimens were obtained from 31 unrelated Italian nuclear
families with a CF child (18 males and 13 females) showing PS.
These patients were regularly followed at the Milan CF Center at
the Department of Pediatrics, University of Milan. CF diagnosis
was based on typical findings of pulmonary CF-related disease (24
cases), on metabolic alkalosis mimicking Bartter's syndrome (3
cases) or on positive neonatal screening (4 cases). Diagnoses were
confirmed by a sweat chloride concentration of 60 mmol/1 or
higher, during Gibson Cooke pilocarpine iontophoresis (Gibson
and Cooke 1959), in all but three cases. In the three patients with
chloride values in the borderline range (40-60 mmol/1), CF was diagnosed for typical Pseudomonas aeruginosa bronchitis and chest
radiological features (Stem et al. 1978; Davis et al. 1980). Age at
diagnosis varied widely only for patients diagnosed because of pulmonary symptoms (median age 12 years 7 months; range 3 months
to 33 years 10 months). Patients' age ranged at sampling from 2.5
to 36.5 years (mean age 17 years 7 months + 8 years 3 months).

conditions in order to detect all
possible base changes)

Assessment of clinical features

DGGE conditions including GC-clamped primer sequences, gradient denaturant concentration, time and voltage of the electrophoretic
separations were as previously described (Fanen et al. 1992; Audrezet et al. 1993) except for those indicated in Table 1. At least
one control sample, carrying an already known mutation, was run
in parallel with samples under investigation, for each exon being
examined. Direct sequencing was performed on asymmetric PCRamplified templates (Gyllensten and Ehrlich 1988).
Microsatellite analysis
Microsatellite analysis was carried out as indicated elsewhere (Magnani et al. 1994).

Results
Screening for predominant mutations
A preliminary screening for mutations being predominant
in our population was carried out in our series of patients
showing PS, revealing the presence of AF508 on 19 (30.6%)
chromosomes, 1717-1G---~A and G542X on 2 (3.22%). In
a previous study the overall frequencies of mutations in
the whole sample population referring to our Center had
been evaluated on a sample of 1018 CF chromosomes
having the following frequencies: A F 5 0 8 : 5 1 6 (50.7%)
chromosomes, G542X: 52 (5.1%), 1717-1G--->A: 41 (4.0%),
N1303K: 35 (3.4%), WI282X: 14 (1.4%) (our unpublished
results).

Search for mutations
Direct sequencing of samples displaying altered electrophoretic mobility through D G G E analysis of 27 exons,
including intron-exon boundaries of the CFTR gene, allowed the identification of 22 mutations (32 chromosomes). Amongst these, three were previously unreported
(W57G, D579G and E193K) (Fig. 1). The remaining 19
included R352Q (Cremonesi et al. 1992) (three chromosomes), G85E (Zielenski et al. 1991a), Dl152H (High-

al. 1992) and S1251N (K~ilin et al. 1992) (one chromosome each). All mutations altering a restriction site were
confirmed by restriction digestion.
The W57G mutation was a T301 to G transversion in
exon 3 substituting tryptophan at position 57 with glycine,
and was detected in a patient from Northern Italy (Lombardia) bearing the R352Q mutation on the other chromosome. This patient presented with severe respiratory symptoms since childhood, but CF diagnosis was made at the
age of 22 years (sweat test 101.74 mmol/1; fat balance
95.45%; severe pulmonary phenotype: FEV l 17%, FVC
34%, chest X-ray score 33, chronic lung P. aeruginosa infection for several years and cor pulmonale). At the age of
27 years, she presented with chronic sinusitis, had been on
chronic oxygen supplementation for 2 years and continuous parenteral antibiotic therapy for 8 months. She was on
a waiting list for heart-lung transplantation.
The D579G mutation was a A1868G transition in exon
12, substituting aspartic acid 579 with glycine and creating an AvrII restriction site. This mutation was found in
two patients both carrying the AF508 mutation on the
other chromosome. The first patient was from Southern

Italy (Puglia), and presented with CF-related symptoms in
the first years of life. CF with pancreatic sufficiency was
confirmed at 7 years (sweat test 77 mmol/1 chloride, fecal
fat balance 97.81%). Clinical evaluation at the latest visit
(20 years) was as follows: FEVI 50%, FVC 77%, chest Xray score 24. Chronic P. aeruginosa and Xanthomonas
maltophilia lung infection occurred since 12 years of age,
allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), upper
right lobe atelectasis and repeated emophtoe since the age
of 10 years which needed repeated bronchial artery embolizations. For the second patient carrying the D579G
mutation, it was not possible to define the grandparental
transmission [grandparents originated from southern
(Puglia) and northern Italy (Lombardia-Emilia)]. He presented with pulmonary symptoms at the age of 1 year but,
due to previous misdiagnosis (tuberculosis, sarcoidosis
and bronchiectasis) and to lack of pancreatic insufficiency, CF was diagnosed at the age of 18 years on the basis of sweat test value (63 mmol/1 chloride). PS was confirmed by fecal fat balance (96%). Clinical evaluation at
the latest visit (28 years 10 months) was as follows: FEV l
29%, FVC 52%, chest X-ray score 30. He has had P.
aeruginosa chronic lung infection since age 18 years 6
months. He is azoospermic.
The third mutation, E193K, was a G709---~A transition
in exon 5 substituting the glutamic acid 193 with a lysine.
It was found in a patient originating from the center of
Italy (Abruzzo), and carrying the AF508 mutation on the
other chromosome, diagnosed at the age of 20 years
(sweat test 82 mmol/1). This patient showed PS associated
with mild pulmonary disease. Clinical and biochemical
assessment at the latest visit (24 years 4 months) were as
follows: FEV 1 91%, FVC 99%, CN score 13, fecal fat balance 94%, presence of intermittent Pseudomonas infection.
The W 5 7 G mutation was not detected on an additional
132 CF and 50 normal chromosomes, D579G on an additional 115 CF and 50 normal chromosomes and E193K on
an additional 108 CF and 54 normal chromosomes.
Chromosomes still carrying unidentified molecular defects after D G G E analysis of the whole coding region of
the CFTR gene were additionally screened for the two intronic mutations 1811 + 1.2kbA---~G and 3849+ 10kbC---~T,
leading to the identification of one (1.6%) chromosome
bearing 3849+10kbC---rT. In total, mutations were detected on 56/62 (90.3%) chromosomes. Table 2 shows patients' genotypes after the preliminary screening (left side)
and at the end of the study (right side).

Microsatellite haplotypes
Five intragenic IVS8/GT, IVS17b/TA and IVS17b/CA
microsatellite haplotypes were found in association with
the six chromosomes still carrying unidentified mutations:
16-30-13 (two chromosomes), 16-30-14, 16-31-13, 1628-12 and 16-7-17 (one chromosome each). The two haplotypes 16-30-14 and 16-28-12 were not detected among
220 CF and 220 normal chromosomes (our unpublished

found in association with other rare mutations, which were
excluded by D G G E analysis in these patients (Table 3).

Discussion
Since the CFTR gene was localized, great efforts have
been focused on detecting mutations. To date, patients
with PS have not yet been exhaustively analyzed as a distinct group, resulting in scarce information about mutations present in these patients, and only a few mutations
have been associated with the PS phenotype. Accordingly,
we searched for mutations in a group of patients with PS,
originating from different Italian regions, using methods
allowing the rapid identification of sequence alterations.
D G G E analysis coupled with direct sequencing in a
sample of 31 patients having PS led to the characterization of 22 mutations, including 3 previously unreported.
These, in combination with three mutations identified
through a preliminary screening for predominant mutations and one intronic mutation, identified molecular de-

Search for m u t a t i o n s in PS patients should be perf o r m e d starting with the analysis o f exons w h e r e m o s t o f
the m i l d m u t a t i o n s s e e m to be located such as exon 7, 5
and 17b in our population, and p r o c e e d i n g with other exons c o d i n g for the two T M domains.
S c r e e n i n g for only eight p r e s u m e d m i l d mutations
(R352Q, R 1 0 6 6 H , G85E, D l 1 5 2 H , 711+5G---~A, T338I,
R 3 3 4 W and D 5 7 9 G ) in addition to the p r e d o m i n a n t four
severe mutations (AF508, G542X, 1717-1G-+A and
N 1 3 0 3 K ) , w o u l d have a l l o w e d the identification o f 64.5%
o f the m o l e c u l a r defects in our patients having PS. This
finding is r e m a r k a b l e in v i e w o f the l o w e r incidence o f severe mutations in patients having PS.
Finally, in 6 out o f 62 C F c h r o m o s o m e s a n a l y z e d in
this study, the m o l e c u l a r defect was not detected. F i v e different intragenic m i c r o s a t e l l i t e h a p l o t y p e s were identified
in these c h r o m o s o m e s . A m o n g these, two were uniquely
d e t e c t e d a m o n g C F - P S c h r o m o s o m e s and are not present
in 220 C F and 220 n o r m a l c h r o m o s o m e s tested. The rem a i n i n g three, relatively frequent a m o n g n o r m a l c h r o m o somes, have b e e n found in association with a l r e a d y
k n o w n mutations, w h i c h have been e x c l u d e d in our sample b y D G G E analysis where they were k n o w n to be detectable. T h e s e findings suggest that mutations on these
