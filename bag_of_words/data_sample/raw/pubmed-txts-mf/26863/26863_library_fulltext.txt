Summary
The chemical relationship of the seven forms of
human liver ot-L fucosidase has been studied by
isoelectric focusing of neuraminidase- and
sialyltransferase-treated preparations of a-Lfucosidase. Neuraminidase treatment leads to a
decrease in the activity of the more acidic forms
(IV-VII) and a concomitant increase in the
activity of the more neutral forms (I-II). Incubation of the neuraminidase-treated fucosidase
(forms I-III) with radiolabelled cytidine
monophosphate-N-3H-acetylneuraminic acid
and an enriched preparation of sialyltransferase
devoid of fucosidase activity led to regeneration
of the more acidic fucosidase isoenzymes (IVVII) with the same isoelectric points and in
nearly the same proportion as before
neuraminidase treatment. These experiments
suggest that the isoenzymes of human liver
a-L-fucosidase are related, at least in part, by
sialic acid residues.
The seven isoenzymes of purified human liver
a-L-fucosidase have been separated by preparative isoelectric focusing and characterized kinetically and immunochemically. Differences in
Michaelis constants (Km's) and pH optimum
curves were found for some of the isoenzymes.
All seven isoenzymes were immunoprecipitated
using the IgG fraction of anti-a-L-fucosidase
antiserum suggesting that the presence of sialic
acid residues does not affect the antigenicity of
the forms of a-L-fucosidase.

Introduction
Several lysosomal hydrolases have been shown
to be glycoproteins which appear to contain

sialic acid residues 1'2. For many of these hydrolases neuraminidase treatment has been shown
to convert acidic to basic forms 3-6. In previous
studies we have demonstrated by neuraminidase
treatment that the acidic isoenzymes of human
liver a-L-fucosidase appear to be related to the
neutral forms by sialic acid residues7,a. Several
other investigators have given evidence that the
acidic isoenzymes of human a-L-fucosidase are
related to the more neutral forms by sialic acid
residues in liver 9, serum and placenta 1°, and in
leukocytes and cultured lymphoid lines 11. In all
of these studies neuraminidase treatment of aL-fucosidase was used to demonstrate that the
isoenzymes are related chemically by sialic acid
residues. Since impure preparations of
neuraminidase have been used in some
studies 12, other interpretations of the results are
possible. For example, the presence of phosphates or sulfatases in the neuraminidase preparations could account for the conversion of
acidic to more neutral forms.
In the present investigation we give further
evidence that the acidic isoenzymes of human
liver a-L-fucosidase (IV-VII) are chemically
related to the neutral forms (I-III) by sialic
acid residues. This relationship is demonstrated
by converting acidic to more neutral forms by
neuraminidase treatment followed by regeneration of the more acidic forms by treatment of
the neutral forms (I-III) with radiolabelled
cytidine monophosphate-N-3H-acetylneuraminic
acid (CMP-NANA) and an enriched preparation
of sialyltransferase. The seven forms of purified
liver a-L-fucosidase have also been separated
by preparative isoelectric focusing, and small
but reproducible and significant differences have

been found between the forms in their kinetic
properties. To our knowledge this is the first
demonstration based on more than just
neuraminidase experiments that the microheterogeneity of a lysosomal hydrolase is
determined, at least in part, by sialic acid
residues and that its various isoenzymes may
differ in their kinetic properties. In this latter
regard, many enzymes (e.g., rabbit muscle aldolase, silkworm alkaline phosphatase, horse liver
alcohol dehydrogenase) have been shown to
have isoenzymes with differing Km's for their
substrates 13.
Materials and Methods

Agarose-e-aminocaproyl-fucosamine was purchased from Miles-Yeda and used in the affinity
chromatographic purification of ot-L-fucosidase.
Substrates for a-L-fucosidase were purchased
from Sigma Chemical Company (p-nitrophenylt~-L-fucopyranoside) and Koch-Light, Ltd. (4methylumbelliferyl a-L-fucopyranoside). Ampholytes for isoelectric focusing were purchased
from LKB Produkter. Neuraminidase (CI. perfringens, type VI) and fetuin (type I) were
purchased from Sigma Chemical Company.
Cytidine 5'-monophosphate-N-3H acetylneuraminic acid (2.33 Ci/mmole) and
Riafluor were purchased from New England
Nuclear. Membranes (PM-10) for ultrafiltration
were purchased from Amicon.

General
All procedures were carried out at 0-4 ° unless
otherwise stated. Enzyme solutions were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Amicon concentrators with PM-10 Diaflo membranes at 50
to 70 p.s.i. Protein was determined by the
LowRy method 14 using human serum albumin as
standard.

Purification of human liver a-L-fucosidase
o~-L-Fucosidase was purified to apparent
homogeneity by a previously described affinity
chromatographic procedure ~5 from 837 g of
adult human liver which appeared normal on
gross pathological examination.

Preparation of IgG fraction from anti-a-Lfucosidase antiserum
The IgG fraction of monospecific antibodies
made against purified human liver a-L172

fucosidase in a previous study~3 was used for
the immunochemical studies.

Enzyme assays
a-L-Fucosidase was assayed either by using pnitrophenyl-a-L-fucopyranoside or 4methylumbeUiferyl-a-L-fucopyranosideas previously reported 7. Enzyme assays were performed under conditions where enzyme activity
was linear with the amount of protein and time
of incubation for the kinetic studies. Absorbances were read at 420 nm on a Gilford
2400-S spectrophotometer and fluoresences on
a Turner fluorometer using an absorption
wavelength of 365 nm and an emission
wavelength of 450 nm. A Unit of fucosidase
activity is defined as the amount of enzyme
necessary to hydrolyze 1 nanomole of
substrate/minute at 37 °. GlycoproteinSialyltransferase was assayed as previously described 16 in an incubation medium containing
the following componer~ts in a final volume of
0.300 ml: 1.0 mg of asialofetuin (ASF); CMP-N3H-acetylneuraminic acid (1.3 × 105 dpm);
100 rrt~, pH 7.0 tris-HC1 buffer containing
16 mM MgC12 and 0.6% Triton X-100. Incubations were carried out in duplicate at 37 ° for
30-60 rain, and the reactions were stopped by
adding 0.5 ml ice-cold 1% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid (PTA) in 0.5 N HC1. The precipitate was
collected on a Whatman GF/c glass fiber filter
in a Gooch crucible and washed with two,
1.0 ml aliquots of cold 1% PTA in 0.5 N HC1.
The precipitate was dried, solubilized in 2.0 ml
2.5 N NH4OH and counted in 10.0 ml Riafluor
in a Beckman LS-250 Liquid Scintillation
Counter. Control incubations without ASF were
carried out for all assays and the incorporation
was subtracted from the incorporation in their
presence. Hexosaminidase and/3-galactosidase
were assayed using the 4-methylumbeUiferyl
substrates as described by Ho et al. 17.

Preparation of slibstrates
Asialofetuin (ASF) was prepared by hydrolyzing
1.0 g fetuin in 400 ml, 0.025 N H2SO 4 at 80 ° for
1 hr TM, dialyzing for two days against distilled
H20 (4 changes of 91/change) in the cold room
followed by lyophilization.
Nonradioactive cytidine monophosphate-Nacetyl-neuraminic acid (CMP-NANA) was prepared as described by KEAN and ROSEMAN19~

Isoelectric focusing
Isoelectric focussing was performed as previoulsy described 15, using an LKB 8101
(110 ml) isoelectric focusing apparatus. One
percent ampholytes (pH 5-8) were used in a
gradient of 0 to 67% (w/v) sucrose. The starting
amperage was 2.5-3.5 mA and 450°475 volts.
Electrofocusing was conducted for 60--64 hrs
after which fractions of approximately 0.7 ml
were collected. The pH of each fraction was
measured at 0-2 ° with a Beckman digital pH
meter and 100 p,1 aliquots of each fraction were
assayed for a-L-fucosidase activity for 300
120 min. Isoelectric focusing was performed on
(1) purified human liver a-L-fucosidase
(420 units), (2) neuraminidase-treated purified
fucosidase (2,240 units), and (3) on a portion of
the neuraminidase-treated a-L-fucosidase
(480 units) which had been incubated with an
enriched preparation of sialyltransferase and
CMP-N-3H-acetyl-neuraminic acid. The fractions from this last isoelectric focusing column
were assayed for a-L-fucosidase and also for
incorporation of radioactive sialic acid into
a-L-fucosidase as follows: to 600/~1 of each
fraction was added 100/~1 of human serum
albumin (10 mg/ml) in 0.1 M citrate-Na citrate
buffer, pH 5.0. The protein in each fraction was
precipitated with 0.5 ml 1% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid (PTA) in 0.5 N HC1, collected
on GF/c glass fiber filters, washed with 4 ml of
I % P T A in 0.5 NHC1, solubilized in 2 ml,
2.5 N NH4OH and counted in 10 ml Riafluor.
The approximate percentage of the total
a-L-fucosidase activity represented by each
peak on isoelectric focusing was determined by
integrating the areas of each peak.
Preparative isoelectric focusing was performed "with a 440 ml column (LKB) on purified
ot-L-fucosidase (3200 units) for 88 hrs to separate the seven forms of a-L-fucosidase for
kinetic and immunochemical characterization.

Neuraminidase treatment
Purified a-L-fucosidase (2,280 units) was incubated with 20 units of protease-free
neuraminidase (Sigma: Cl. perfringes, type VI)
in 0.1 M citrite-Na citrate (pH 5.0) containing
5 mg/ml human serum albumin for 20 hrs at
37 ° . The reaction mixture was centrifuged for
15 rain at 48,000 x g, the supernatant assayed
for a-L-fucosidase and then subjected to

isoelectric focusing. A control was run on
a-L-fucosidase incubated alone at 37 °.

Preparation of glycoprotein-sialyltransferase
An enriched preparation of glycoproteinsialyltransferase free of lysosomal hydrolase
activity was prepared as follows: 5.0 g of normal
human liver was homogenized in a ground glass
homogenizer with 25.0 ml of 0.1 M tris-HC1, pH
7.0, containing -5 mM MgC12. The homogenate
was centrifuged at 48,000 x g for 30 min, the
supernatant discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 26.0 ml of the tris-HCl buffer. The
resuspended pellet was centrifuged at 48,000 × g
for 30 min, the supernatant discarded and the
pellet was resuspended in 9.0 ml of the tris-HCl
buffer. This washed and resuspended pellet was
assayed for ASF-sialyltransferase, a-Lfucosidase,/3-galactosidase and hexosaminidase
and was used in treating the neuraminidasetreated a-L-fucosidase to regenerate the more
acidic a-L-fucosidase isoenzymes.

Sialyltransferase treatment of neuraminidasetreated a-L-fucosidase
After neuraminidase treatment and isoelectric
focusing (see Fig. 1B), the three most neutral
peaks of a-L-fucosidase (I-III, pH's 5.95-7.00)
were combined, dialyzed, concentrated from
19.6 to 3.0 ml and assayed for a-L-fucosidase
activity. To this was added the resuspended
pellet (9.0 ml) containing the enriched sialyltransferase, 1.78 x 10 s dpm of CMP-N-3H acetyl-neuraminic acid, 0.9 mg cold CMPNANA and enough Triton X-100 and MgCl2 to
make their final concentrations 0.6% (v/v) and
16 raM, respectively. This mixture was incubated
for 2.75 hr at 37 ° and centrifuged at 48,000 x g
for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was
treated two more times as above with freshly
prepared liver pellets enriched in sialyltransferase. The final supernatant was assayed for
a-L-fucosidase and subjected to isoelectric
focusing. A control experiment was run as
above including all components (CMP-NANA,
sialyltransferase pellet, etc.) except the
neuraminidase-treated a-L-fucosidase to determine the extent of endogenous acceptor activity.

Starch gel electrophoresis
Vertical starch gels were run according to the
method of Smithies2° on 10-30 ttl samples of
173

separately combined, dialyzed and concentrated
a-L-fucosidase peaks I-VII from preparative
isoelectric focusing at pH 5.9 [gel buffer: 5 mu,
pH 5.8, citrate-phosphate buffer; discontinuous
bridge buffer: 40 mu citrate-phosphate buffer,
pH 5.9, and 10% (w/v) NaCI] for 3 hr at 25 mA
and 300 volts. The gels were incubated for
45 min at 37°C with 1.0 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl-a-L-fucopyranoside, and the
bands of fucosidase activity were visualized with
an ultraviolet lamp after exposing the gels to
0.085 M glycine-carbonate, pH 10.0.

Kinetic studies
Apparent Michaelis constants (Km values) were
determined for the seven forms of a-Lfucosidase graphically by the Lrr~WEAVER--BuRK
method 21 using the p-nitrophenyl substrate.
Incubations were carried out in duplicate for
30-60 min at 37 ° in substrates of varying
concentrations in 100 mu citrate-sodium citrate
buffer (pH 5.0).

purification with 38%yield. The final specific
activity was 22,100 nmoles/min/mg protein.
Figure 1 A depicts the isoelectric profile of a
portion (420 units) of the purified ~,-Lfucosidase. Seven forms with isoelectric points
(pI's) ranging from pH 5.0 to 6.6 were resolved.
When the purified a-L-fucosidase was incubated with neuraminidase and then subjected to
isoelectric focusing (Fig. 1B), a decrease in
activity of the more acidic forms (IV-VII) with
a concomitant increase in activity of the more
neutral forms (I-III) was obtained. These
neutral forms found after neuramifiidase treatment were combined (fractions with pH's 5.957.00; Fig. 1B), dialyzed to remove the reagents
used in isoelectric focusing, concentrated from
19.6 to 3.0 ml and assayed for a-L-fucosidase.

reaction was initiated with 200/~1 of pnitrophenyl-a-L-fucoside (3 mM) in buffers of
varying pH values. All incubations were carried
out in duplicate for 45-90 min at 37 °,

fucosidase. Whereas forms I and II represent
only 21.9% of the activity in pure ~,-Lfucosidase, after neuraminidase treatment they
represent 54.3% of the total activity. When
forms I-III were combined (without any of
forms IV-VII) and treated with sialyltransferase,
a substantial amount of forms IV-VII was
regenerated, together accounting for 20.5% of
the total a-L-fucosidase activity. Although the
percentages in Table 1 are approximations, they
show dearly that neuraminidase treatment decreases activity of the acidic forms (IV-VII) and
increases the more neutral forms (I-II) and that
sialyltransferase treatment of forms I-III regenerates a substantial amount of enzymatic activity
of forms IV-VII.
Preparative isoelectric focusing was performed on purified liver a-L-fucosidase to
separate the seven isoelectric forms for kinetic
and immunochemical studies. The isoelectric
profile was very similar to that in Figure 1A and
therefore not shown here. The seven forms
were each combined separately, dialyzed and
concentrated. To determine whether the forms
had been adequately separated by isoelectric
focusing, starch gel electrophoresis was performed at pH 5.9 on each of the seven forms.
At this pH, forms I-III should migrate towards
the cathode and forms IV-VII towards the
anode. Figure 3 shows that each isoelectric
focusing peak contained predominantly one
form of a-L-fucosidase with the expected electrophoretic migration.

regenerated after treating forms I-III with
CMP-NANA and sialyltransferase. The fractions from the isoelectric focusing column were
assayed for fucosidase activity and for radioactive incorporation of SH-NANA into a-Lfucosidase. Figure 2 shows the isoelectric profile
of the sialyltransferase-treated a-L-fucosidase.
From this figure it is clear that the more acidic
o~-L-fucosidase isoenzymes (IV-VII) [and possibly a new acidic form at pI 4.60] have been
regenerated. Furthermore, the figure shows that
there was incorporation of radioactivity into
forms IV-VII. For forms IV, VI and VII, the
fractions of maximal enzymatic activity correspond exactly with the fractions of maximal
incorporation. The new form at pI 4.6 also
shows a correspondence of maximal enzymatic
activity with maximal incorporation. The pI's
and relative proportions of the regenerated aL-fucosidase forms (IV-VII) are very similar to
those of the corresponding forms in the untreated, purified a-L-fucosidase (Fig. 1A).
Isoelectric focusing of the control incubation
(lacking neuraminidase-treated a-L-fucosidase)
did not yield a radioactive profile comparable in
any way to that of a-L-fucosidase, indicating
that the results depicted in Figure 2 are not due
to endogenous acceptor activity.

isoelectric focusing of pure a-L-fucosidase,

differences are statistically significant
(p < 0.01) by the two-tailed, student's T-test.
Figure 4 shows typical p H optima curves for
purified human liver a-L-fucosidase and for
some of the forms (I, IV, and VII). Reproducible differences in the p H curves were found for
three determinations. Table 3 summarizes the
percentage of maximal enzymatic activity for
each of the seven forms and for the purified
whole enzyme for each p H value. Whereas
forms I and VI had no enzymatic activity at
p H 3.08, the purified whole enzyme and form
IV had 27 and 45 percent, respectively, of
maximal enzymatic activity at this pH. Inspection of Table 3 indicates that there are many
differences in the percentage of maximal enzymatic activity for the different forms of
fucosidase at various pH's. In general, forms
I I - V I are most alike and similar to the whole
enzyme, whereas forms I and V I I are most
unlike the whole enzyme, particularly at low
(3.08, 3.55) and high (7.48, 7.75 and 8.04)

isoenzyme m a y be related to the m o r e acidic
forms of a - L - f u c o s i d a s e found in h u m a n
serum 1°'11'25. T o our knowledge this is the first
time that the separated isoenzymes of a purified
lysosomal hydrolase have been shown to be
related, at least in part, by sialic acid residues.
MAPES and SW~ELEV6 have d e m o n s t r a t e d that
h u m a n plasma a-galactosidases (A and B) are
related by sialic acid residues, but their results
are complicated by the multiplicity of fourteen
a-galactosidases generated by neuraminidase
and sialyltransferase treatment.
T h e seven isoenzymes of purified a - L fucosidase were separated by preparative
isoelectric focusing. After starch gel electrophoresis indicated that the forms had been
separated (Fig. 3), each f o r m was characterized
kinetically. Small but reproducible and possibly
significant differences were found for some
isoenzymes in their K m ' s for p - n i t r o p h e n y l - a L-fucopyranoside. T h e five forms of h u m a n
placental a - L - f u c o s i d a s e have been shown previously to have up to three-fold differences in
their K m ' s for the p-nitrophenyl substrate 1°.
T h e p H o p t i m a curves of the various isoenzymes showed rather large differences in the
percentage of maximal enzymatic activity at
various p H ' s (Fig. 4; Table 3). As in a previous
study 15, a broad p H o p t i m u m between 4.3 and
5.1 was found for the purified t~-L-fucosidase.
It appears that the presence and/or amount of
sialic acid residues m a y affect the kinetic p r o p erties of certain a - L - f u c o s i d a s e isoenzymes at
least with the synthetic substrate used in the
present investigation. Similar studies with
natural substrates need to be done to establish
the physiological significance of the isoenzymes.
These studies await the availability of substantial amounts of a natural substrate.

The role of sialic acid in the antigenicity of
the forms of a - L - f u c o s i d a s e has been studied
using the I g G fraction of the antibodies m a d e
against purified h u m a n liver a - L - f u c o s i d a s e 15.
Preincubation with I g G led to immunoprecipitation of all seven forms of a-L-fucosidase. This
suggests that several antibodies were originally
m a d e against all seven forms of the enzyme 15 or
that one or m o r e antibodies were made against
antigenically similar isoenzymes. The data also
suggest that the presence and/or a m o u n t of
sialic acid residues does not affect the antigenicity of the multiple forms of a-L-fucosidase.
