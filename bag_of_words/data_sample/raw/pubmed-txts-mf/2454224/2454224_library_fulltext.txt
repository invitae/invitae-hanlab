As in some of the collagen deletions described in 01, the
splicing defect in EDS VI1 does not interfere with the coding
frame of the mRNA, and therefore the resulting polypeptide
is efficiently utilized in the assembly of trimers that contain
a shortened pro-a2(1) subunit. The deletion, in addition to
removing the N-Proteinase cleavage site, eliminates another
important structural element, the N-telopeptide cross-linking
site (20). Whether or not the loss of this site has any

to EDS VI1 pathology is unknown, Interestingly, however, in

(20, 27-29).
In conclusion, these studies provide the first molecular
characterization of a collagen defect in EDS VI1 and thefirst
evidence of a splicing abnormality in such a complex POUP of
genes.Our preliminary data also suggest the presence of
similar splicing abnormalities in three, possibly four, additional EDS VI1 patients. Thus, EDS VII, in contrast to the
