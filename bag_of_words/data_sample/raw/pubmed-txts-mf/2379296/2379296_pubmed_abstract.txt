The authors used Wenger's vegetative nervous balance factor analysis to measure vegetative nervous function of 75 patients with vertigo revealing enhancement of sympathetic nervous function. The proliferation activity of IL-2 receptor was determined by the amount of 3H-TdR incorporated cpm in the peripheral blood lymphocyte after exogenous IL-2 stimulation (Lymphocult-T). The authors used this technique to measure the activity of IL-2 receptor in 49 patients with hepatitis and vertigo. The results showed that the activity of IL-2 receptor in patients with or without vertigo was lower than the controls (P less than 0.001). And patients with vertigo showed lower activity of IL-2 receptor than that without (P less than 0.01). In these patients with asthenia-syndrome the activity of IL-2 receptor was lower than those with asthenia syndrome. The activity of IL-2 receptor in these patients with long course was lower than those with short course. The difference of sex and age was not significant. The above results suggest that "Wind" in TCM might be related to the enhancement of sympathetic nervous function and the activity of IL-2 receptor.
