Introduction
Adhesion of cells to their micro-environment and their
subsequent proliferation and migration are regulated in
part by their interaction with various components of
the extracellular matrix (ECM) [I**]. This regulation
involves molecular interactions that govern the attachment of cells to specific ECM components, detachment
of cells from these components and molecular rearrangements in the ECM that allow cells to change shape during division and/or migration. Proteoglycans (PGs) are
one of the ECM components that participate in these
regulatory events [ 2*-4*,5**--7**,8*].
Their involvement
with a number of component molecules that take part
in these processes is mediated either through charge
interactions via the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains
(carbohydrate-protein)
or through protein-protein
interactions via specific domains within the core proteins
of the PGs. Recent reviews that stress the interactive nature of PGs and the role that they play in regulating cell
behavior are available (Fig. 1) [ 5**-7**,8*]
Cell adhesion
Cells form stabilized contacts with the ECM by a complex
process that depends on multiple interactions between
ECM receptors and their various ligands and elements of
the cytoskeleton [ 91. These contacts must be broken and
reformed as cells proliferate and migrate. Proteoglycans
promote cell adhesion by facilitating attachment of cells
to specific ECM components (Fig. 2). For example, cell

surface heparan sulfate (HS) PGs are necessary for the
formation of stable focal adhesion sites on fibronectincoated substrates [lO,ll]. Recent studies have identified
a sequence within fibronectin that interacts specifically
with a cell surface phosphatidylinositol-anchored
HSPG
in mouse melanoma cells [ 12*]. These observations indicate that specific classes of PGs can mediate integrinindependent adhesion events.
Expression of cell surface PGs that interact with ECM ligands appears to be critical for some cells to maintain their
differentiated phenotype. Sll5 mouse mammary epitheliaf cells lose their flattened epithelial morphology and
become
tumorigenic when exposed to steroids. These
changes are reversed when the cells are transfected with a
full length cDNA to human syndecan, which is an intercalated membrane PG [ 13**]. The importance of syndecan
in cell adhesion is further illustrated by the obsetvation
that this membrane PG is transiently expressed on prep- and immature p-lymphocytes when in contact with the
bone marrow stroma, but is absent from circulating and
peripheral lymphocytes following release from the marrow (reviewed in [7**] ). As syndecan is known to exist in
different polymorphic forms and bind a variety of ECM
ligands (reviewed in [7**] ), either transient expression
and/or structural modifications in this PG may regulate
the adhesion of cells to different ECMs at different times
during
development.
CD44 is another family of polymorphic integral membrane glycoproteins and PGs that participate in ceUular adhesion [7=*,14**]. There are both low (80-90kD)

and high (200 kD) molecular weight forms of CD44. The
smaller form, which lacks GAG chains, predominates on
lymphocytes and is responsible for the adherence of
lymphocytes to the surface of high endothelial venules,
a process referred to as lymphocyte homing. The high
molecular weight form bears chondroitin or heparan sulfate chains and participates in cell adhesion through the
ability of the GAG chains to bind ECM ligands such as fibronectin. Many cells express PG forms of CD44 that can
be localized to filopodia and zones of cell contact [ 14-I.
CD44 also contains a domain that possesses homology
to the hyaluronan-binding region of cartilage link protein
and the amino-terminal portion of two interstitial CSPGs,
aggrecan and versican (reviewed in [7*-l >. This domain
allows these molecules to interact with hyaluronan, an interaction that is important in the adhesion and migration
of cells in ECM enriched in hyaluronan [ 15,16*].
Syndecan and CD44 are members of different families of
intercalated membrane PGs that have conserved cytoplasn-tic domains containing potential phosphorylation sites
(reviewed in (7-I). Intercalated membrane PGs such as
NG2 [17*] do not contain these specific sequences, but
do contain potential phosphorylation
sites. The presence of such sites has led to the suggestion that these
molecules are important in signal transduction during cell
adhesion.
Cell surface PGs also promote the adhesion of microorganisms to cells. Parasites such as Tgpancxoma cruzl
[18*] and malaria (Phsmodia) sporozoites [ 19.1 contain
membrane proteins that specifically bind heparin- or HScontaining PGs. Invasion of these parasites into cells can
be blocked by competition with heparin or HS. The importance of surface-associated HSPG in Herpes simplex

participate

virus infection has recently been shown by demonstrating that Chinese hamster ovary mutant cells defective in
HSPG synthesis are resistant to infection by the virus
[20*]. Such studies point towards an important new area
of investigation of clinical relevance concerning plasma
membrane PGs.
Proteoglycans within the ECM or within specialized structures such as basement membranes may themselves serve
as ECM ligands for adhesion. For example, the principal
PG in basement membranes is a large HSPG, perlecan.
Recent studies reveal that the core protein in both mouse
[21-l and human [ 220, 23-l perlecan contains multiple
domains with homology to adhesive molecules such as
laminin and neural cell adhesion molecule, suggesting
perlecan may also serve as a ligand for cell surface receptors. A 38 kD membrane protein has been tentatively
identified as the cell surface receptor for this PG in
cultured hepatocytes [24]. In addition, a heparin-binding 78kD protein (moesin) [25*] has homology to a
number of proteins that form structural links between
the cell membrane and elements of the cytoskeleton. It
remains to be shown whether the interaction of these
membrane-associated proteins with extracellular HSPG
affects adhesion and modulates the behavior of cells that
synthesize perlecan or other HSPGs.
Whereas the interactions described above promote adhesion, PGs can also interfere with adhesion in several
ways. PGs in the ECM may interact with other ECM adhesion ligands, such as fibronectin, and block the interaction of the ligand with its cell surface integrin receptor
(Fig. 2) [8*]. The small interstitial dermatin sulfate (DS)
PGs, decorin and biglycan, interact with a number of
adhesive ECM kgdnds, either through their GAG chains

[ 26.1, or their core proteins [ 27*] and interfere with cell
attachment. The presence of large interstitial PGs at the
cell surface may prevent the interaction of cell surface
receptors with their specific ECM ligands by steric exclusion [28]. In addition, cell surface associated PGs may
interact with other anti-adhesive ECM molecules such as
thrombospondin
[29] and tenascin [30-l to destabilize
cell contact points (reviewed in [3I--1).

Cell migration
Adhesion sites are continually disrupted and reformed as
cells change shape and move. Cell movement is also
accompanied by changes in the cellular micro-environment involving the replacement of dense fibrous ECM
that serves to stabilize stationary cells with a loose hydrated micro-environment that creates pathways for cell
migration. Proteoglycans and hyaluronan, a GAG that occupies large solvent domains, influence these processes.
Generally, the molecules that destabilize adhesion sites
(e.g. CSPGs and hyaluronan) promote cell motility, while
the PGs that contribute to the formation of tight cellular
adhesion sites (i.e. HSPGs) inhibit cell migration. In fact,
when stationary vascular endothelial
cells are induced to
migrate, they switch from synthesizing an ECM enriched
in HSPG to an ECM enriched in CUDS PG [ 321.

The importance of CSPGs in cell migration is well established. Removal of CSPG from the surface of mouse
melanoma cells or inhibition of CSPG synthesis by these
cells prevents their migration and invasion into type I
collagen gels without affecting adhesion to a collagen
substratum [33*]. The cell surface PG responsible for
this activity is a CSPG whose core protein is immunologicaLly related to CD44. Furthermore, a spliced variant
of CD44 is selectively expressed in metastasizing rat carcinoma cells and is capable of conferring metastatic behavior to non-metastasizing carcinoma cells [34-l. Although
CD44 is not expressed by all cells during migration, other
cell surface PGs may serve a similar role. For example,
in the healing of cutaneous wounds, the migrating and
proliferating epithelial cells and endothelial cells forming
new blood vessels show increased expression of syndecan [35*]. While changes in specific PGs are associated
with the onset of cell migration, the precise mechanism
by which PGs influence this cellular event is not understood.
Although certain PGs facilitate or promote celJ migration
in some systems, other PGs inhibit or establish barriers to migrating cells. For example, regions enriched in
CSPG in the developing mammalian retina exclude advancing growth cones [36**]. Removal of CSPG from
these regions results in new axonal growth. Localized

accumulation of CSPG also correlates with restriction
of neural crest cell migration in developing chick embryos [37*]. m another mode1 of axonal guidance, axonal extensions of dorsal root ganglia avoid contact with
explants of epidermis in co-culture [38*]. Inhibition of
CSPG synthesis with P-xyloside, or incubation of the
co-cultures with anti-CSPG antibodies, results in contact between extended axons and epithelial explants,
abolishing avoidance of contact that is seen in control
cultures. Also consistent with the conclusion that CSPGs
delimit the pathways of neuronal outgrowth is the observation that CSPGs isolated from rat brain inhibited nerve
growth factor-induced neurite extension when bound to
pheochromocytoma
cells [39*]. Thus, it may be that
PGs function as ‘avoidance’ molecules in the nervous
system by acting as steric blockers for receptors in the
growth cone of elongating axons (discussed in [31*-l >.
Two recent papers, however, suggest novel mechanisms
by which matrix PGs may influence ceU migration. For example, HS and CS signilicantly increase activation of plasminogen by urokinase-type plasminogen activator [40-l,
which has been previously localized to ceU adhesive sites,
where it is thought to be involved in proteolytic events
that are associated with ceU migration. Also, in a model of
embryonic smooth muscle ceU migration in the ductus arteriosus, a critical event is the penetration of cells through
elastic laminae. This process may involve shedding of a
cetl surface elastin receptor, in a process induced by CS
[41*].
The GAG, hyaluronan, formerly termed hyaluronic acid,
also plays a role in ceU migration. Although the man
ner in which this GAG exhibits its effect is not clear,
several studies have shown an increased but transient
production of hyaluronan that coincides with rapid cell
migration during processes of in&nmation,
wound repair, tumor invasion and morphogenesis (reviewed in
[16*]). Addition of hyaluronan to some cells in culture promotes their migration [42*,43-l, an activity that
can be eliminated by removing hyaluronan with either
enzyme treatments or blocking antibodies against ceU
surface hyaluronan-binding proteins. Thus, hyaluronanbinding proteins are required for hyaluronan to influence
ceU migration and they are associated with the leading
1arneUae of rapidly migrating cells [43*-,44*]. This family
of integral membrane glycoproteins and PGs has been recently named the hyaladherins, although synonyms such
as ‘HAHAgrins’ and ‘gripabags’ have also been proposed
[WI!
Cell proliferation
Different PGs can function to either inhibit or promote ceU proliferation (Fig. 3). Several laboratories have
demonstrated that heparin and HS suppress the entry
of cells into S phase in response to some mitogens
(reviewed in [45] > but the mechanism(s) remains unclear. A number of studies have addressed several possible mechanisms. For example, for some cells and n-rtogens, growth inhibition may involve the inactivation of
the mitogen by heparin [46*,47-l. Although heparin and
HS are usually considered the only GAGS with anti-prolif
erative properties, DS of high iduronate content inhibits
the proliferation of human fibroblasts [48*]. Such studies

suggest that the uranic acid moiety in the GAG chain is
important as a structural determinant for the anti-proliferative activity of these GAGS. Unusual disaccharides
containing a 2sulfated uronate have been found in the
nucleus of growth-arrested hepatoma cells [49,50], although similar structures have not been found in the
nuclei of smooth muscle cells that are growth arrested
with heparin [45]. The fmding of GAG fragments within
the nucleus suggests that GAGS might influence proliferative activity by interacting with transcription factors
that are critical for ceU replication. For example, hepat-in treatment of 3T3 cells blocks phorbol ester induction of c-myc and c-fos, two proto-oncogene products
necessary for ceU replication in some cells [51,52] .Recent experiments suggest that heparin interferes with
the activation of these proto-oncogenes by interacting
with specific transcription factors, inhibiting the binding of these trans-acting factors to DNA [53--l. Many
of the transcription factors have heparin-binding basic
amino acid sequences (discussed in [6-l). These observations raise the distinct possibility that GAGS may,
under some circumstances, regulate gene activity at nuclear sites.
Proteoglycans may also function as mitogens.The 80 kD
subunit of colony stimulating factor-l (CSF-1) contains a
single chain of CS [ 54*]. This PG regulates the prolifera
tion and differentiation of mononuclear phagocytic cells
in bone marrow. As CSF-1 PG possesses the same biological activity as its lower molecular weight counterpart,
which does not bear GAG chains, it is unlikely that the
GAG chain participates directly in growth factor activation. However, the GAG chain might permit the interaction of the growth factor with the ECM in the haemopoietic micro-environment for utilization by target cells in a
manner similar to that described for the binding of other
growth factors in bone marrow stroma [55,56].
Proteoglycans may also influence cell proliferation by interacting with growth factors either acting as growth factor receptors [57-l or modifying the interaction of the
growth factors with their high-affinity receptors [ 58,59*].
Such interactions are believed to induce conformational
changes in the growth factor [6O*] or possibly in the
growth factor receptor, perhaps involving dimerization,
such that high-affinity interactions between Ugand and
receptor are possible. Removing HS from the surface
of 3T3 cells and skeletal muscle myoblasts dramatically
reduces the binding of basic Iibroblast growth factor
(bFGF) to these cells [6l*] while leaving the mitogenic
activity of other growth factors such as of platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF) and epidemlal growth factor unaffected. Recent studies indicate that HS chains contain a
specific carbohydrate sequence in which N-sulfate groups
and iduronate-2-sulfates are essential for binding of bFGF
[62**]. This is in contrast to the binding of transforming
growth-factor (TGF)-PI to the PG component of the
TGF-P receptor, betaglycan, in which the GAG chains
are not required [63,64-l. These different binding sites
allow for the binding of more than one growth factor to
the same PG [65*].
Proteoglycans may also sequester growth factors in the
ECM in a form protected from proteolysis [66**,67] and
thereby regulate their availability and/or activity. Release

Cell proliferation is often accompanied by the selective
expression of specific PGs. For example, syndecan is expressed by proliferating cells in the mesenchyme during tooth bud morphogenesis [72*]. In addition, the
stimulation of arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation
by PDGF is accompanied by specific changes in the
transcription/translation
and post-translational processing of versican, which is a principle PG present in blood
vessels [ 73.1. Although
the relevance of these changes to
the growth state of the cell is not yet understood, such
modifications in specific PGs may alter the binding characteristics of the micro-environment surrounding cells af
fecting growth factor availability and/or activity. It should
be emphasized that although increased PG synthesis is
correlated with cell proliferation, induction of PG synthesis does not always appear to be a prerequisite for
cell proliferation as interruption of PG synthesis by /3o-xylosides can be uncoupled from the anti-proliferative
effect of this molecule [74*,75*].

of the growth factor-PG complex could occur by the action of proteases, glycosidases or phospholipases [68*]
made available during events associated with development, tissue injury and formation of new blood vessels
169,701. Support for an effect by PGs on growth factor activity comes from studies that demonstrate that the small
interstitial DSPGs, decorin and biglycan, can inactivate the
mitogenic activity of TGF-j31 [71]. Interestingly, TGF-p1
stimulates the synthesis of these small DSPGs in some
cells (reviewed in [8*] ), and this reciprocal relationship
may be one way in which specific PGs regulate the activity
of growth factors.

Conclusion
We have reviewed a number of examples published
within the last year that implicate PGs in the regulation of cell adhesion, migration and proliferation. While
some of the evidence is still circumstantial, several studies
suggest that PGs can effect the biological activity of component molecules involved in these processes through
highly specific interactions. The remarkable structural diversity of the Merent families of PGs provides a multiplicity of ways in which these interactions can occur.
The challenge for the future will be to define the nature
of these molecular interactions and the biological consequence( s) of such interactions in regulating cell function.

Complete
sequence
of a cell surface PG. NG2, from rat neural cell lines
has been deduced
from cDNA clones. This newly cloned PG contains
a different
c>qoplasmic
domain
from other membrane
PGs and is thus
considered
novel. Comparison
of amino.terminal
sequences
shows that
a PG previous$
characterized
as the human melanoma
PG is the human homologue
of this PG. Sequence
infon-nation
will be valuable
in
fUNre studies designed
to investigate
the role of this PG in both human
melanoma
and neuronal
function.

One of a number

that PGs can associate with the surface of some cells via a phosphotidylinositol

in the plasma membrane.
This phosphatidylinositolassociated
HSPG
binds bFGF and this complex
can be released as a biologically

C. This mechanism,
together
with the proteolytic cascade of plasminogen

This study addresses the question of whether

is that
the inhibitory
effects of some xylosides
on ceU proliferation
must be
due to effects other than altered PG synthesis
