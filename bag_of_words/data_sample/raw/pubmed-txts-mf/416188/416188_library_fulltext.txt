Inherited human collagen lysyl hydroxylase
deficiency: Ascorbic acid response
A patient & described with congenital hypotonia, lax joints, friable skin, hemorrhagic scars, high-arched
palate, and borderline microcornea. Acid hydrolyzed whole ski n collagen had a reduced hydroxylysine
content of O.5 residues per 1,000 as compared to 5.1 • 0.7 in control skin. Collagen lysyl hydroxylase
in dialyzed subcellular fractions o f cultured skin fibroblasts required L-ascorbate as a principal cofactor.
Activity of this enzyme in cultured skin fibroblasts derived from this"patient, his father, and mother were
17%, 66%, and 39% of control values, respectively. Collagen prolyl hydroxylase activity was normal.
Pharmacologic amounts of oral vitamin C (4 gin~day) produced an increase and withdrawal resulted in
abrupt diminution of urinary excretion of hydroxylysine. Over a two-fear period the patient's wound
healing and muscle strength improved and corneal diameter increased. Hydroxylysine content of the skin
did not increase.

ences. In Types IV, V, VI, and VII different biochemical
mechanisms have been proposed. '-11
The first of these to be defined biochemically was
hydroxylysine (Hyl)-deficient collagen disease with
impaired collagen lysyl hydroxylase (E.C.I.14.11.4) classifted as Type VI. 6, 7, lo Four affected families, including
the present one, have been reported with Hyl-deficient
skin collagen and impaired collagen lysyl hydroxylase?, 8-10 Reducing agents required for the assay of this
enzyme included dithiothreitol and ascorbic acid. Quinn
and Krane 12 demonstrated that the enzyme from cultured
fibroblasts of their patient was less stable at 37 ~ than the
wild type and had a lower affinity for ascorbate than the
wild type.
In many inherited disorders, knowledge of the cofactor
requirements for the specifically impaired enzyme reactions and the subsequent administration of pharmacologic
amounts of vitamin precursors of these active cofactors
have resulted in dramatic clinical improvement. 1~ No
specific enzyme requiring ascorbic acid has been defined
which, when impaired genetically, is also augmented by
supraphysiologic concentrations of this cofactor. Since
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (Type VI) involved a specifically
impaired enzyme which utilized ascorbate as its principal

physiologic reductant, we considered the potential basic
information and practical therapeutic alternatives to be
gained from a study of the in vivo effects of ascorbate on
this disease.
The present work describes a patient with EhlersDanlos (Type VI) phenotype with Hyl-deficient skin
collagen and a clinical response to pharmacologic
amounts of vitamin C.

CASE REPORT
The patient (J. D. H.), a white boy, was studied between the
ages of 8 and 10 years. He was born at term with marked
hypotonia. The wrists were completely subluxed and the heads of
the humeri could be lifted out of the glenoid cavity bilaterally. He
developed socially at a normal rate, but was unable to sit until
age 16 months and did not walk until 22 months, He had multiple
lacerations after minor trauma that were associated with
abnormal scar formation. He had mild myopia. His skin was
velvety, smooth, and hyperextensible over the elbows. There
were multiple hemorrhagic, atrophic scars, particularly over the
knees, elbows, and tibial area. There were molluscoid pseudotumors and spherules over knees and elbows. The joints were
hyperextensible and he could touch the tips of both shoulders
under his chin. Corneal diameter was below the lower limits of
normal and was 10.2 mm on the right and 10.4 mm on the left.
There were no retinal changes or laxity of ciliary muscles. He had
a high-arched palate. Quantitative muscle testing demonstrated
severe muscle weakness particularly of the chest, back, shoulder
girdle, and abdomen. Pulmonary function tests indicated an
increased residual volume to total lung capacity of 40% as
compared to an expected value of less than 25%. Ivy method
bleeding time was prolonged at 1289 minutes (normal = 1 to 9
minutes).
A clinical diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was made and
skin biopsy was obtained. The patient's skin contained only 10%
of norm~tl Hyl residues, but other amino acids were present in
normal amounts.

METHODS
Clinical research studies. Five normal control subjects
and the patient were studied through the Emory University Clinical Research Unit. Each patient was informed in
detail of the investigative nature of the study and the
procedures to be performed, and written consent was
obtained. The patients were placed on a collagen-free diet
consisting of 30 calories/kg, 1 gm protein/kg, in which
50% of total caloric intake was administered as carbohydrate. All protein was given as casein for two days before
and during the studies.
Preparation and analysis of urine and skin for amino
acids and glycosides of hydroxylysine. Ten-milliliter
aliquots of urine were acidified, lyophilized, and analyzed
directly by ion exchange chromatography on a Beckman
120 amino acid analyzer using previously defined

mined by the tritium exchange method of Peterkofsky and
DiBlasio TM with minor modifications. L-[4,5-3H] lysyl
collagen substrate was incubated with fibroblast enzyme
preparation at 30~
in a reaction mixture which
contained 50 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM a-ketoglutarate, 0.0 to l.0 mM L-ascorbate, 0.1 mg catalase, 0.05
mM Fe(NH4)~SO4, 0.75 mg bovine serum albumin, and
0.1 mM dithiothreitol. The assay was stopped by the
addition of 50% trichloroacetic acid. The supernate was
then applied to A G Dowex 50W-X8 columns and the
eluted tritium counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Prolyl hydroxylase activity was measured by the same
procedure except that the reaction mixture contained L[3,4-3H] prolyl collagen substrate and 0.1 mM a-ketoglutarate. In both assays enzyme activity was defined as
tritium release in the presence as compared to the absence
of a-ketoglutarate.
Materials. L-[4,5-3H] lysine (21 Ci/mmole) and L-[3,4~H] proline (41 Ci/mmole) were purchased from Amersham/Searle Corp.; a-ketogutarate, L-ascorbic acid, and
a,a' -dipyridyl were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.
Catalase was purchased from Worthington Biochemical
Corp., Pentex bovine albumin fraction V, fatty acid poor,
from Miles Laboratories, Inc., and dithiothreitol from
Calbiochem. Dowex 50W-X8 was purchased from Bio
Rad Laboratories.
RESULTS
Skin from the patient had 0.5 residues of Hyl per 1,000
amino acids whereas normal skin contains 5.1 _+ 0.7

residues per 1,000. The ratio of Hyl to Hyp was 0.011 as
compared to normal values of 0.051 + 0.0094 Since skin
collagen Hyl content is determined by collagen lysyl
hydroxylase, the specificity and genetic control of this
enzyme were determined using cultured skin fibroblasts
from the proband, his parents, and control cell lines.
Collagen lysyl hydroxylase activity in the patient's
cultured skin fibroblasts was approximately 17% of
control values from four different lines; his father's and
mother's cell lines had 66% and 39% of control activity,
respectively (Table I). By contrast, the patient's cell line
had prolyl hydroxylase activity which was statistically
indistinguishable from control lines.
This collagen lysyl hydroxylase assay was evaluated to
enable cofactor assessment. A pH optimum of 7.5 was
determined at 30~ and activity was linear throughout 20
minutes of incubation. A direct relationship was seen
between tritium release and protein content of the subcellular enzyme preparation between 0 and 75 /~g. At all
protein concentrations, activity from the mutant cell line
was markedly reduced. Following these initial experiments, prolonged dialysis of control enzyme preparations
was undertaken to assure removal of aqueous-soluble
cofactors such as ascorbate. When L-ascorbate alone was
removed from the reaction mixture, only 4% of,complete
normal" activity was present.
Because of the observed role of ascorbate in collagen
lysyl hydroxylase function and because of the hemorrhagic quality of the scar tissue, the patient was first
evaluated for potential ascorbate deficiency. Dietary

history indicated that he had been ingesting at least 50 mg
of ascorbate per day over the past year. Twenty-four-hour
urine and plasma ascorbate were compared to three
normaL, age-matched control subjects. The patient's
urinary and plasma levels of ascorbate before loading
were within the normal range of 8 to 37 m g / d a y / g m of
creatinine and 0.2 to 2 mg/dl, respectively. After a single
oral dose Of 4 gm of ascorbate the patient excreted 786
mg/day/gm of creatinine in urine as compared to three
control subjects who excreted between 285 and 1,155.
Plasma levels of ascorbate after loading rose similarly to
those in control subjects and reached levels between 2.0
and 4.0 mg/dl plasma. Thus ascorbate deficiency was not
present.
An in vivo response to pharmacologic doses of ascorbate was then investigated by measuring the urinary
excretion of both total and free Hyl. As seen in Fig. 1,
control subjects' 24-hour urinary free Hyl excretion fell
with increasing age. After treatment with 4 gm of ascorbate daily for four days, Hyl excretion rose significantly in
all control subjects (P < 0.01 using paired t test). At age 8,
the patient's Hyl excretion was reduced compared to his
age-matched control subject. With increasing doses of
ascorbate his free Hyl excretion rose to 48 then stabilized
at 25/zmoles/day/gm Of creatinine. As seen in Table II,
total urinary Hyl values also rose, although not as
dramatically. Although slight elevations in Hyp excretion
were seen, they were not as great as those in Hyl excretion.
Thus the ratio of Hyl to Hyp increased (Table II). These
values for total Hyl were somewhat lower than those in
the age-matched control subject, which was 196/zmoles/
day/gm of creatinine and did not change on ascorbate
treatment. Urinary Hyp levels in the proband were the
same as in control subjects; the Hyl to Hyp ratio in the
control subjects was between 0.13 and 0.14 whereas the
patient's ranged between 0.08 to 0.12. Urinary glycosides
of Hyl were measured and accounted for between 66 and
85% of the total Hyl content. There was no consistent
change in glucosylated Hyl or the ratio of glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine to galactosylhydroxylysine with administration of increasing amounts of ascorbate. Since
kidney basement membrane collagen is rich in Hyl and
has relatively more 3-Hyp than 4-Hyp, the ratio of urinary
3-Hyp to 4-Hyp was measured. 23 The ratio in both the
patient and his age-matched control subject was 0.056
before and 0.047 after ascorbate, suggesting no significant
contribution by kidney basement membrane to increased
Hyl excretion.
The patient's urinary excretion of total and free Hyl was
monitored while he was receiving ascorbate over the next
two years. During this period, plasma ascorbate ranged
between 2.0 and 4.0 mg/dl. At 10 years of age the patient's

dramatic fall in Hyl excretion to less than 3/~moles/day/

subjects (Fig. 1). Thus the increase and fall in urinary Hyl
was associated with oral administration of vitamin C.

formation. Biopsies were obtained before and three
months and eight months after initiation of vitamin C
therapy. Hyl content was 0.5, 0.5 and 0.9 residues/I,000
amino acids in each of these samples. However, the
character of biopsy scars improved dramatically (Fig. 2).
Three scars produced by biopsies obtained in March and
July, 1974, before ascorbate therapy was begun, were red,
raised, and thin, in contrast to three biopsy scars similarly
produced three months and eight months after ascorbate
treatment was begun. On histologic examination, preascorbate scars contained dilated vessels with extravasated
old blood, whereas postascorbate scars looked normal.
Scars formed while the patient was on ascorbate therapy
were not large enough to biopsy adequately for Hyl
determination.
In addition to improved wound healing, several other
observations suggested clinical improvement. Corneal
diameter increased 0.3 mm in each eye over the 20 months
of ascorbate therapy (Table III). Corneal diameter
normally does not increase after four years of age. 24 After
ascorbate therapy, the patient's corneal diameter
approached but did not reach the lower limit of his ageand sex-matched control subjects. 2' Muscle strength
improved, as assessed by direct muscle testing. The
increased residual volume noted on previous pulmonary
function tests was normal one year after therapy. Bleeding
time returned to normal. Joint laxity and friability of skin,
however, remained.
DISCUSSION
As in most described inherited metabolic disorders, a
large hiatus exists between the observed biochemical

impairment and the mechanisms producing the expressed
phenotypeY 5 The patient described herein had muscle
weakness, lax joints, and hemorrhagic, friable skin. His
skin collagen contained only 10% of normal Hyl. Collagen
lysyl hydroxylase was impaired in his cultured skin
fibroblasts and an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance for this enzyme defect was observed. This constellation of phenotypic changes may be related to the
biochemical alterations through a reduction of number,
type, and distribution of cross-linking in dermal, tendinous, and vascular collagen. 6, ~, ~6 By contrast to
previously reported phenotypes, in our patient severe
vertebral and ophthalmic abnormalities were not evident.
One possible explanation for these organ differences is
that different isozymes of lysyl hydroxylase exist in
different tissues. The expression of a mutation by a
specific organ would depend, therefore, on the relative
importance of a given subunit to that organ's function.
For instance, Type III collagen [l(III)]:, which predominates in the collagen of fetal tissues and blood vessels,
may require a different lysyl hydroxylase than Type I
[1(i)]3 collagen for its production. No data on this point
are available. Another possibility is that different tissues
have different cofactor concentrations, particularly of Lascorbate, which we found to be the principle physiologic
reductant for lysine hydroxylation. Pinnell et al 6 espoused
this hypothesis to explain the variable degree of Hyl
deficiency in collagen from different tissues of the same
patient. Variations in tissue content of ascorbate may
affect the expression of different mutations, depending on
the molecular site of enzyme impairment and the relationship Of this site to L-ascorbate action.
Pharmacologic amounts of ascorbate were associated
with improvements in muscle strength, corneal growth,
bleeding time, an d pulmonary residual volume. In addition, Urinary hydroxylysine excretion increased on administration of ascorbate and decreased on withdrawal. These
in vivo observations suggested that 4 g m / d a y of ascorbate
increased hydroxylation of lysyl residues in newly synthesized collagen and that its production and degradation
were measurable in urine. Askenasi 2~-3~demonstrated that
the amount of free and peptide-bound urinary Hyl was a
physiologic index o f collagen metabolism. He also
provided evidence that renal basement membrane did not
contribute significantly to the urinary Hyl pool. 3i Since
the Clq component of hemolytic complement represents
only a ,fraction of total body Hyl, its contribution to
urinary Hyl must be negligible.
If this regimen of vitamin C were augmenting mutant
lysyl hydroxylase, why then did skin Hyl content not
increase? One explanation is that L-ascorbate enhanced
collagen lysyl hydroxylase activity only where new
collagen was produced, as in new scar formation or

Volume 92

corneal growth. Gould 32 postulated in scorbutic models
that there was more than a single mechanism for collagen
formation: one used for normal body collagen formation
and one predominating in tissue repair. He suggested that
the former was independent o f ascorbate and the latter
was dependent on its presence. Barnes et a133, 34 implied
that in cultured L-929 cells, hydroxylation of lysine in the
nonhelical portion of the developing collagen molecule
was under control by a separate ascorbate-dependent
lysyl hydroxylase distinct from a more active lysyl hydroxylase. Hornig 3~ found that 14C-ascorbate localized to the
ground substance of the intima of guinea pig blood vessels
and suggested that n o n r a n d o m distribution of ascorbate
indicated differences in its utilization by various tissues.
Miller 36 further demonstrated that ascorbate did not
activate preformed, inactive lysyl hydroxylase in nonscorbutic cultured L-929 cells as was seen for prolyl hydroxylase. In dermal skin collagen only five of approximately
30 lysine residues are normally hydroxylated on a 1(I) and
a2 chainsY In our patient only 0.5 were hydroxylated. By
contrast, corneal collagen m a y have as much as 67%
hydroxylation of its a l ( I V ) chain lysyl residues. 23 This
unusual degree of hydroxylation in corneal collagen may
account for the unique growth of this tissue during
administration of ascorbate to our patient. Thus, the
improved wound healing and corneal growth expressed
by our patient in the absence of increased Hyl content of
preformed skin collagen might be an expected result from
the administration of large amounts of vitamin C in vivo,
if only specialized lysyl hydroxylase, actively forming new
collagen in specific organs, was augmented. The mechanisms of action of ascorbate on our mutant enzyme and
the variable tissue responses require further clarification.
However, the observed in vivo responses of this single
gene mutation and its expression in cultured fibroblasts
provides a model for further investigation.
