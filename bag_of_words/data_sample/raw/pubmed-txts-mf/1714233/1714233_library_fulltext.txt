Summary
Four mutations of the porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase gene that result in cross-reacting immunological
material (CRIM)-negative forms of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) have been identified by in vitro
amplification of cDNA from patients and by cloning of the amplified products in a bacterial expression vector.
One mutation is a single base deletion which causes a frameshift and which is expected to result in the synthesis
of a truncated protein. Two other mutations consist of single base substitutions and lead to amino acid
changes. The fourth mutation is a single base substitution producing an aberrant splicing and resulting in
an mRNA which would encode a protein missing three amino acids. DNAs from 16 unrelated CRIM-negative
AIP patients were screened for the presence of these four mutations, by hybridization with oligonucleotides
specific for each of the mutations, but none of the four mutations was identified in additional patients. The
results indicate that mutations responsible for CRIM-negative AIP are highly heterogenous.

Introduction
Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an autosomal
dominant disease defined by a partial deficiency of

porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase (hydroxymethylbilane synthase; E.C.4.3.1.8), the third enzyme of the
heme biosynthetic pathway. The clinical manifestations are characterized by acute attacks of neurological dysfunctions with abdominal pain, hypertension,
tachycardia, and peripheral neuropathy (Kappas et al.
1989).
The molecular heterogeneity of the mutations producing AIP was suggested by studies of the PBG deaminase
gene locus which demonstrated that AIP mutations
were associated with different restriction haplotypes
(Lewellyn et al. 1987; Lee et al. 1988). Moreover,

several phenotypic subtypes at the protein level have
been described. In the more common forms of AIP, in
which the PBG deaminase deficiency occurs in all cell
types, different investigators have documented the existence of two subgroups of patients, based on the
measurement of cross-reacting immunological material (CRIM) in erythrocytes; these subgroups are referred to as CRIM-negative and CRIM-positive phenotypes (Desnick et al. 1985; de Rooij et al. 1987;
Kappas et al. 1989).
More recently, the genetic basis of AIP mutations
has begun to be clarified. The mutations producing
the CRIM-positive subtype of AIP have been shown
to be heterogenous. Of nine patients studied, one had
a point mutation in exon 12 of the PBG deaminase
gene which resulted in a defective splicing and which
led to the formation of a shortened mRNA (Grandchamp et al. 1989a), four had a transition G- A in
exon 10 leading to an arginine-to-glutamine substitution at position 149 of the protein, and two had a
G A transition leading to an arginine-to-glutamine
substitution at position 155 of the protein (Delfau et
al. 1990). Similarly, elsewhere we have described two

different mutations accounting for a subgroup of AIP
families in which the expression of the enzymatic defect is restricted to nonerythropoietic cells (Grandchamp
et al. 1989b, 1989c). Until now, only one mutation
resulting in a CRIM-negative form of AIP has been
reported (Scobie et al. 1990).
Here we report the determination of four additional
mutations which result in the CRIM-negative form of
the disease. The amplification products of PBG deaminase cDNA from four patients were cloned and sequenced. Subsequently, the genomic DNAs from 16
other unrelated patients were screened for the presence
of these mutations. None of the four mutations was
found in any of these patients, indicating the great
heterogeneity of this subtype of AIP.
Patients and Methods
Patients

Twenty patients with CRIM-negative forms of AIP
studied. The diagnosis was established on the
basis of typical clinical symptoms accompanied by increased urinary excretion of porphobilinogen and
aminolevulinic acid and by normal fecal porphyrin
excretion. Diminished activity of PBG deaminase was
also observed in erythrocytes of all patients.

were

ing spin columns (IBF, Clichy, France). The purified
fragments were ligated into the corresponding sites of
the plasmid expression vector PKK 233 (Pharmacia,
Uppsala) and were subcloned in Escherichia coli DH5.
Cloned cDNAs were sequenced using a sequenase
sequencing kit (USB Corp., Cleveland) according to
the instructions of the manufacturer. Two of the sequencing primers hybridized to the vector, one on each
side of the insertion site (PKK1 and PKK2), and four
other primers hybridized to either the coding (PHEI
Nco, PHE6, or PHE10) or the noncoding (PHE15
Hind) strands of the cDNA (table 1).
Bacterial Expression System
For each patient, 20 to 30 bacterial clones carrying
a recombinant plasmid with a human PBG deaminase
cDNA insert were tested for the expression of PBG
deaminase activity. In brief, bacteria were grown overnight in 5 ml of LB medium, harvested by centrifugation, washed with Tris-HCl buffer (10-mmol/liter,
pH8.0), and disrupted by sonication in the same
buffer. The PBG deaminase activity was determined
as previously described (Delfau et al. 1990).
Lysates of E. coli containing the recombinant plasmid PKK 233 with either normal or mutated PBG
deaminase cDNAs were analyzed by western blot using specific antibodies against human PBG deaminase

CRIM Determination

The CRIM phenotype was determined using erythrocytes from one or two members of 20 families with
AIP as previously described (de Rooij et al. 1987).

as previously described (Delfau et al. 1990). In some
instances, immunoprecipitation of the proteins reacting with the antibodies was carried out prior to the
western blot analysis, in an attempt to concentrate
small amounts of immunoreacting material.
Direct Sequencing of Amplified Products

The DNA fragment between intron 9 (PHI9) and
exon 11 (PHE1 1) was amplified by PCR, yielding a
457-bp fragment. One percent of the product was reamplified in order to generate single-stranded DNA by
asymmetric PCR, as previously described (Dicker et
al. 1989), using nested primers which hybridized to
genomic sequences in exon 10 (PHE10) and intron
10 (PHI10), allowing the amplification of a 200-bp
segment. Each primer was independently used as a
limiting primer, in order to generate single-stranded
DNA corresponding to one or the other strand of the
genomic fragment. The PCR fragment was washed
three times with 2 ml of H20 in a Centricon 100 membrane filtration (Amicon, Danvers, MA). Of 50 pl
collected, 7 pl were used for sequencing using the same
primer as that which was limiting during the PCR.

To extend our study to patients with a CRIMnegative phenotype, four patients were studied. For
each patient, PBG deaminase activity was determined
from 20 to 30 bacterial clones. In all the cases, 50%
to 60% of the clones failed to express the human PBG
deaminase activity and were considered likely to conA

Amplification of Genomic DNA

DNA amplifications were carried out according to
the method of Saiki et al. (1988), in the presence of
Taq polymerase Biolabs, Beverly, MA). With a thermocycler (Hybaid, Teddington, United Kingdom), two
fragments were amplified independently. A 1,200-bp
fragment between exon 6 (PHE6) and intron 9 (PHI9AS) was obtained after 30 cycles, as follows: at 950C
for 15 s, at 480C for 30 s, at 530C for 1 s, and at 720C
for 1 min 30 s. A 1,900-bp fragment between intron
9 (PHI9) and exon 15 (PHE15) was amplified by 30
cycles, as follows: at 95°C for 15 s, at 540C for 30 s,
at 59°C for 1 s, and at 720C for 2 min 30 s.

Results

We recently devised a new strategy to determine
the mutations responsible for AIP in CRIM-positive
patients (Delfau et al. 1990). The totality of the coding
sequence of cDNA was amplified in vitro and was
cloned in a prokaryotic expression vector. Because
patients are heterozygous for the PBG deaminase-deficient allele, two types of clones are expected to occur:
those with the normal cDNA, which express human
PBG deaminase activity, and those with the mutated
cDNA.

tain the mutated cDNA. Three or four of these clones
were sequenced for each patient. Mutations were confirmed on at least two independent clones. Some
clones contained "sporadic" base changes which were
attributed to errors introduced by the Taq polymerase
during the PCR, as previously reported (Tindall et al.
1988).
Four different mutations were found:
1. A G- A transition at position 446 of the cDNA
from the translation initiation codon ATG, occurring in exon 9, which leads to an arginine-toglutamine substitution in the theoretical protein
(fig. 1A).
2. A T--LG transversion at position 734, occurring in
exon 12, leading to a leucine-to-arginine substitution (fig. 1B).
3. A single base deletion of a thymine at position 900,

in exon 14, resulting in a stop codon located 15
codons downstream from the deletion (fig. MC).
4. A deletion of the last 9 bp of exon 10 (data not
shown), resulting in a new BamHI restriction site
in the coding sequence. This mutation was directly
confirmed by BamHI digestion of amplified cDNA
(data not shown). In order to determine the genomic mutation responsible for this abnormality, we
decided to directly sequence an amplification product from genomic DNA containing the donor splice
site of exon 1 0. After a first amplification of a 457bp fragment between intron 9 and exon 1 1, a 200bp fragment containing the junction segment was
asymmetrically reamplified (fig. 2A). Direct sequencing of the amplification product showed a
G IT substitution of the last base of the exon 10
(IVS 10-1) (fig. 2B).
The relative abundance of the abnormally spliced
mRNA was determined by quantitative PCR after reverse transcription. A 122-bp cDNA fragment was
amplified from mRNA of the patient. After PCR, the
products from the normal mRNA and from the defective mRNA were separated by gel electrophoresis. As
shown in figure 3, the two bands were of equal intensity, and the two products contained the same amount
of radioactivity (data not shown), suggesting that the
stability of the abnormally spliced mRNA was not
diminished.

SPLICING MUTATIONS

among AIP patients, two fragments of PBG deaminase
gene were amplified (fig. 4). The first fragment, between exon 6 and intron 9, contained the 446 mutation (C). The second, between intron 9 and exon 15,
included the three other mutations (F, G, and I) identified in the present study. Mutations were revealed by
hybridization of the corresponding amplified fragment with mutation-specific oligonucleotides. All the
oligonucleotides, except that used for detecting the
IVS10-1 mutation, were 17 bases long and centered
on the position of the mutation. Their orientations
were chosen in order to obtain the most destabilizing
mismatch (Ikuta et al. 1987). The oligonucleotide
used for the IVS10-1 mutation screening was 14 bases
long, therefore excluding an intragenic DNA polymorphism (G or T; author's unpublished data) situated 6 bases upstream from the mutation. Despite its

small length, this oligonucleotide recognizes a single
sequence in the amplified fragment, as assessed by
computer analysis. The results of these studies confirmed the data obtained with the cDNA fragments
(fig. 5).
Detection of the abnormal protein was attempted
using specific immunoprecipitation and western blot
analysis from lysates of Escherichia coli strains containing the mutated cDNAs, using specific antibodies
against normal human PBG deaminase (de Rooij et
al. 1987). Although the proteins synthetized in this
bacterial system from a normal cDNA and from abnormal cDNAs corresponding to patients with a
CRIM-positive phenotype were readily detectable (Delfau et al. 1990), similar experiments failed to show
the presence of any protein product from the abnormal
cDNAs characterized in the present study.
Sixteen additional patients with CRIM-negative
AIP were screened for the presence of each of the four
mutations. None of the mutations identified in these
studies was found in additional patients (fig. SA and B).
Discussion

Most of the carriers with the AIP trait remain
asymptomatic. Early detection of these individuals is
important in the prevention of acute attacks, which
are often precipitated by additional factors such as
drugs, alcohol, and caloric deprivation (Kappas et al.
1989). Because asymptomatic carriers do not consistently excrete excess amounts of heme precursors, the
usual screening method in AIP families is based on the
determination of PBG deaminase activity in erythrocytes. Enzymatic activity levels, however, are affected
by additional factors such as erythrocyte age and the
presence of other diseases, resulting in some overlap
between values for normal individuals and those for
AIP patients (Grandchamp and Nordmann 1988;
Kappas et al. 1989). These limitations prompted us to
undertake the study of the mutations responsible for
AIP at the DNA level.
The strategy that we have used in the present study
to determine the mutations responsible for CRIMnegative forms of AIP relied on cloning PCR-amplified
cDNAs in a bacterial expression vector. Starting from
mRNA allows the amplification of the entire coding
sequence in one step and focuses the search for mutations on approximately one 10th of the PBG deaminase gene. The success of this approach supposes that
the mutated gene is transcribed and that the resulting
mRNA is present and stable in the cells. All CRIM-

et

al.

positive and many CRIM-negative mutations could be
detected in this way, including most splicing mutations and amino acid substitutions which result in protein instability.
Since patients with AIP are heterozygous for the
mutation, the use of an expression vector allows an
easy distinction between clones derived from the mutant mRNA and those derived from the normal
mRNA, based on the determination of human enzymatic activity present in E. coli, and therefore it facilitates the interpretation of the sequencing data. The fact
that 50O to 60% of the clones obtained from each
patient failed to express the human PBG deaminase
activity suggests that the mutated alleles were expressed at a level similar to that of the normal ones.
Several different types of mutations resulting in the
CRIM-negative form of AIP were identified: In two
cases, a single base change resulted in amino acid substitutions. One of these two mutations resulted from
a G-AA transition in a dinucleotide CG. Such mutations are thought to arise from oxidative deamination
of methylated cytosines and have previously been detected with high frequency in several genetic diseases
(Youssoufian et al. 1988).
The third mutation was a point deletion. This is an
infrequent type of mutation but has been previously
described (Weatherall et al. 1989).
The fourth mutation resulted in abnormal splicing
of intron 10. Analysis of a genomic fragment containing the donor site of exon 10 showed that the
patient was heterozygous for a point mutation G-UT
at the last position of exon 10 (table 2). Such a mutation has been previously described in a CRIM-positive
form of AIP, at the last base of exon 12, but resulted
in the absence of exon 12 in the mRNA (Grandchamp
et al. 1989a). Here a cryptic site is activated, three
codons upstream of the normal site, yielding a stable
abnormal mRNA. The functional consequence of the
mutation described here may appear surprising, since
the mutated 5' splice site still contains a six-nucleotide
match with the consensus sequence. It is interesting,

however, to note that the cryptic site also has a sixnucleotide match with the consensus sequence, in particular the G/GT highly conserved sequence (table
2). Pairing of U1 SnRNA to the mutated splicing site
would create a C/A mismatch, more destabilizing
than U /G matching which exists when the cryptic site
is used.
No mutated protein produced from mRNA containing these mutations is detectable immunologically
either in erythrocytes or in recombinant E. coli strains
bearing the mutated cDNAs. This is not surprising for
the single base deletion which leads to a truncated
protein, but the single base substitutions and the splicing mutation affect neither the reading frame nor the
sequences used for translational control. A single
amino acid substitution responsible for an enzymatic
defect with an unstable protein has been previously
described (De Verneuil et al. 1986). Moreover, it has
been demonstrated that PBG deaminase activity requires the covalent binding of a cofactor, a dipyrrolmethane, and it was suggested that this cofactor may
protect the enzyme from degradation (Umanoff et al.
1988). The mutations determined here could prevent
binding of the cofactor, leading to an unstable protein.
These mutations, however, do not change the cysteine
residue 261 of the human protein which is highly conserved through evolution. Cysteine 242 located at a
homologous position in the E. coli enzyme has indeed
been shown to covalently bind the cofactor (Miller et
al. 1988). The absence of immunoreactive protein is
compatible with the possibility that the enzyme is present but that its three-dimensional structure is sufficiently altered to prevent the recognition by anti-

bodies.
Both previous work at the protein level (de Rooij et
al. 1987) and RFLP studies (Lewellyn et al. 1987; Lee
et al. 1988) indicated that acute intermittent porphyria is a heterogenous disease at the molecular level
and that point mutations rather than large deletions
are likely to account for most of the cases. Heterogeneity of CRIM-positive forms of AIP has been previously
reported (Delfau et al. 1990). Here we show that in the
CRIM-negative form, a phenotypically homogeneous
subtype of AIP, many different mutations are responsible for the disease. The molecular heterogeneity of
CRIM-negative forms seems to be more important
than that of CRIM-positive forms, since two CRIMpositive mutations accounted for the disease in six of
eight studied patients. On the contrary, each of the
CRIM-negative mutations described here has a frequency lower than 1 /20. The large number of differ-

427

ent molecular lesions responsible for AIP may suggest
that mutations at the PBG deaminase locus have been
well tolerated in the human organism through evolution. This is perhaps not surprising, since heterozygous gene carriers infrequently express the disease
phenotype. A larger epidemiological study is necessary
to precisely define the frequency of the different mutations.
