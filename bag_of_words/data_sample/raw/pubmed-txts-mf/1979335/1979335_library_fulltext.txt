Abstract
In a family expressing euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia, an increased association of plasma thyroxine (T4) with transthyretin
(TTR) is transmitted by autosomal dominant inheritance and is
secondary to a mutant TTR molecule with increased affinity
for T4. Eight individuals spanning three generations exhibited
the abnormality. Although five of eight individuals had elevated total T4 concentrations, all affected individuals were
clinically euthyroid and all had normal free T4 levels. Purified
TIR from the propositus had an affinity for 125I-T4 three times
that of control 1TTR. Exons 2, 3, and 4 (representing > 97% of
the coding sequence) of the TIR gene of DNA prepared from
the propositus' peripheral blood leukocytes were amplified
using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were sequenced after subcloning. Exons 2 and 3 were indistinguishable
from normal. In 50% of clones amplified from exon 4, a substitution of adenine (ACC) for guanine (GCC) in codon 109 resulted in the replacement of threonine-for-alanine, a mutation
confirmed by amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides derived
from purified plasma TTR. The adenine-for-guanine substitution abolishes one of two Fnu 4H I restriction sites in exon 4.
PCR amplification of exon 4 of TT7R and restriction digestion
with Fnu 4H I confirmed that five affected family members
with increased binding of 25.I-T4 to TMR are heterozygous for
the threonine 109 substitution that increases the affinity of this
abnormal TIR for T4. (J. Clin. Invest. 1990. 86:2025-2033.)

Introduction
Transthyretin (TTR),' also known as thyroxine binding prealbumin, is a serum protein of hepatic origin that transports

roid individuals with hyperthyroxinemia secondary to an increased association of thyroxine (T4) with TTR (1-7). These
subjects are often incorrectly diagnosed, and subjected to unnecessary laboratory tests and inappropriate therapy (1). Several investigators have demonstrated increased total T4 in
clinically euthyroid subjects who have marked elevations of
circulating transthyretin (2-4). In 1982, we reported a patient
with euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia and suggested that the elevated serum T4 resulted from an abnormal TTR with increased affinity for T4 rather than from an elevated concentration of TTR. Lalloz et al. (5, 6) and Croxson et al. (7) have
reported other patients with a similar abnormality. In this report, we have investigated in greater detail the mechanisms
underlying the hyperthyroxinemia in the kindred reported by
us and describe a point mutation in the TTR gene that appears
to be responsible for the greater affinity of this molecule for T4.

Methods
General hormone and protein assays. Total T4 (Corning Medical,
Medfield, MA), T3 resin uptake (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights,
IL), total T3 (Clinical Assays, Cambridge, MA), and thyroxine binding
globulin (TBG, Corning Medical) were measured using standard commercially available kits. Free T4 was measured both by dialysis and by a
two-step direct immunoassay procedure (Clinical Assays). TTR concentrations in serum were measured by rocket immunoelectrophoresis
(1). Comparisons between groups were performed by the Student's
unpaired t test and statistical significance was arbitrarily defined at P
< 0.05. Statistical significance of differences between the affinity of
mutant TTR and normal TTR was determined by the Mann-Whitney
test.

Protein binding and sequencing studies. 27 relatives of the proband
were screened for an increase in T4 associated with TTR by three
assays: (a) T4 immunoprecipitation by anti-TTR IgG, (b) a modified
T4-loaded T4 charcoal-uptake test (8), and (c) serum paper electrophoresis after incubation of sera with '251I-T4 (1). Sera from these subjects
were also compared with sera from six normal unrelated subjects aged
25-50 yr.
For the immunoprecipitation assay, 100 ,d of a 1:25 dilution of sera
in PBS were incubated with 1251-T4 (6 X 10-12 M; SA 4,400 Ci/mmol
New England Nuclear, Boston, MA) in 100 Al of PBS containing 100
Mg/ml of BSA for 3 h at 37°C. 100 ,d of a 1:20 dilution of anti-TTR IgG
(Atlantic Antibodies, Scarborough, ME) were added before incubation
overnight at 4°C. The TTR-IgG complex was precipitated in the presence of 0.1% bovine gamma globulin and 10% (wt/vol, final concentration) 8,000 mol wt polyethylene glycol (PEG) for 30 min at 4°C and
centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for an additional 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was counted in a gamma spectrometer. Data were expressed as a percent of total counts precipitated by
anti-TTR. All samples were measured in duplicate in at least three
separate assays.
The T4-loaded T4 charcoal-uptake test was performed using a modification of the method of Stockigt et al. (8). In this assay, 1O Al of sera
was incubated with 125I-T4 in the presence of 1-0 unlabeled T4, an

amount sufficient to saturate the high affinity, low capacity T4 binding
site on TBG. Samples were incubated for I h at 23°C in PBS, pH 7.4,
containing 0.1% gelatin before mixing with 0.5 ml of chilled 1% Norit
A charcoal/0.4% Dextran 70. Charcoal-bound '25I-T4 was separated by
centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatants containing the protein-bound '25I-T4 were counted for 1251I. This represents
'25I-T4 bound to TTR and albumin.
The electrophoretic distribution of 1251-T4 in sera was measured by
filter paper electrophoresis in a Tris-maleate buffer, pH 8.6, as described previously (1). 5-mm strips of paper were cut beginning at the
origin and counted for 1251. Data were expressed as a percentage of total
recovered counts associated with TBG, albumin, and TTR, respec-

tively.
TTR purification, competitive binding studies, and protein sequencing. TTR was purified by three-step column chromatography as
described previously (9). TTR affinity for thyroxine was assessed with a
competitive binding assay using both whole sera (1:25 dilution in PBS)
and purified TTR (0.5 ,ug/tube), as described above for the immunoprecipitation studies except that replicate samples of sera or purified
TTR were incubated with '251-T4 (6 x 10-12 M) in the presence of
varying concentrations of unlabeled T4. Previous studies (data not
presented) demonstrated that the incubation conditions resulted in
steady-state binding of '25I-T4 to TTR. TTR-bound '25I-T4 was separated as described above for the immunoprecipitation assay and
counted in a gamma spectrometer. Affinity constants were calculated
by the method of Scatchard (10). All assays were performed at least
three times.
Purified TTR (3 mg) was digested overnight with 2% trypsin (wt/
wt), and the resulting peptides were isolated using reverse-phase
HPLC. Specific purified tryptic peptides were sequenced in a liquidphase protein sequenator, as previously described (1 1). Peptides for
sequencing were selected based on DNA sequencing of exon 4 as
described below.
Enzymatic amplification of genomic DNA and DNA sequencing.
Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes by
phenol/chloroform extraction using standard techniques (12). The
TTR gene consists of four exons encoding a protein monomer of 127
amino acids and 14,000 mol wt (13, 14). Exons 2, 3, and 4 of the TTR
gene encode > 97% of the amino acid sequence and were amplified
using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with three oligonucleotide
primer sets as previously described ( 11) and producing PCR products
of 215, 258, and 190 bp, respectively. Exon 1 which encodes only the
first three amino-terminal amino acids was not studied (13, 14). Each
oligonucleotide primer contained a PST- 1 restriction enzyme recognition site that was used for subsequent subcloning (15). PCR product
DNA fragments were visualized after agarose gel electrophoresis (1.8%
agarose) in the presence of ethidium bromide. Appropriate length
fragments were excised from the gel, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and ethanol precipitated. They were digested with PSTI and
ligated into MP-18RF DNA with T4 DNA ligase (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) (15). These constructs were used to transform
competent JMIOI Escherichia coli (15). Single-stranded DNA was
isolated from 8 clones derived from exon 2, 10 clones from exon 3, and
8 clones from exon 4. The DNA was sequenced using the dideoxy
chain termination method with modified T7 DNA polymerase (16)
(Sequenase Version 2.0; U.S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH).
Screening family members for mutations in the TTR gene using
PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). A point
mutation present in four of eight M- 13 colonies of exon 4 from the
proband eliminated one of two restriction sites for the enzyme Fnu 4H
I in exon 4. Based on this observation, we isolated genomic DNA from
additional members of the proband's family and subjected the DNA to
PCR amplification of exon 4 with the following oligonucleotide
primers (see also Fig. 8):

Moses et al.

These PCR reactions were performed with Taq DNA polymerase
(Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT) for 40 cycles. Denaturation was
accomplished at 90°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 60 s, and extension at 70°C for 60 s, except during the last cycle where the extension
time was 7 min. Aliquots of the amplified PCR product DNA (100 ng)
were digested with 1.5 U of the restriction enzyme Fnu 4H I (New
England Biolabs, Beverly MA), and subjected to electrophoresis in 4%
agarose gels (Nusieve; FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME). The bands
were visualized with ethidium bromide staining and photographed.
The mutation predicts fragments of 222 and 35 bp as opposed to 207-,
15-, and 35-bp fragments for the normal gene. Heterozygotes, therefore, are expected to display both 207- and 222-bp fragments (the
smaller fragments usually are not visualized using this technique).

Results

Studies offamily members. Of 27 family members screened, 8
demonstrated increased precipitation of 1251I-T4 by anti-TTR
IgG compared with six normal controls (27.0±4.8% vs.
5.78±2.0%, respectively, P < 0.0001; Fig. 1). Affected family
members were defined as those in whom the 125I-T4 precipitated by anti-TTR IgG was more than 3 SD greater than the
mean obtained in the six normal control subjects, which was
15%. There was no overlap between the affected individuals
and the six control subjects. Moreover, there was no overlap
between affected and unaffected family members and no difference between unaffected family members and controls

(Fig. 1).

increased fraction of T4 migrating with TTR by paper electrophoresis compared with six unaffected family members
(51±5% vs. 31.7±7.6%, respectively, P < 0.009; Fig. 1) and
there was no overlap of TTR associated '25I-T4 between affected and unaffected individuals. There was a corresponding
decrease in the amount of '25I-T4 associated with TBG in the
affected (29±6.8%) versus the unaffected (43.8±4.9%) family
members (data not shown).
We confirmed that the concentration of TTR was not significantly increased in the affected individuals (39.5±17 mg/dl
[affected] vs. 31.7±9.9 mg/dl [unaffected]; Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, there was no correlation between the individual
TTR concentrations and '25I-T4 precipitated by anti-TTR IgG
(Fig. 3). Serum TBG levels were identical (19.3 mg/liter, Fig.
2) in both the affected and unaffected groups of family
members.
Serum T4 was significantly higher in affected than in unaffected family members (12.5±1.7 vs 9.2±3.2 jg/dl respectively, P = 0.0009), as was the free T4 index (11.8±2.6 vs
7.76±2.2, respectively, P = 0.0002; Fig. 4). Five of the eight
affected patients had serum T4 levels above the upper limit of
the normal range (12 Ag/dl), although there was considerable
overlap between the two groups. Free T4 by equilibrium dialysis and by a two-step direct free T4 assay was normal in all
affected subjects. There was no significant difference in serum
T3 levels between affected (135±21 ng/dl) and unaffected subjects (127±22 ng/dl). The latter finding is not unexpected
given the low affinity of TTR for T3.
We have used the data from immunoprecipitation of 125IT4 with anti-TTR IgG to investigate the mode ofinheritance of
this cause of euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia. As shown in Fig. 5,
TTR-associated hyperthyroxinemia was identified in two generations and was transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait.
These data suggest that affected individuals are heterozygous
from a presumed mutation in the TTR gene.

these findings are consistent with affected individuals having
an increased association of T4 with TTR or with albumin.

proband's TTR gene that could account for the increased affinity of this protein for T4, we performed DNA sequencing of
TTR exons 2, 3, and 4 following PCR amplification of genomic DNA. Within exon 4, four of eight independent M-13
clones revealed an adenine-for-guanine substitution in the position corresponding to the first base of the triplet codon for
amino acid residue 109 (Fig. 7). This finding is consistent with
a heterozygous defect which is present in half of the alleles.
This mutation encodes threonine (ACC) at this position instead of alanine (GCC) found in normal TTR. The DNA sequence of 8 clones isolated from exon 2 and 10 clones from
exon 3 failed to detect any consistent changes from the reported normal TTR cDNA sequence. We did not amplify
exon 1, which encodes only the first three amino terminal
residues of TTR (13, 14).
Direct amino acid sequencing of HPLC-purified tryptic
peptides ofthe propsitus's TTR confirmed a threonine-for-alanine substitution at this location and also confirmed the heterozygous nature of the mutation (Fig. 8). HPLC separation of
tryptic peptides generated from the propositus' TTR revealed
a peak (11- 12*, Fig. 8) not found in wild-type TTR. Amino
acid sequence analysis of this peptide (residues 104-114) revealed a sequence of Arg-Tyr-Thr-Ile-Ala-Thr-Leu-Leu-Ser-

Parallel studies were performed on whole sera from affected
and unaffected family members and the results with whole sera
were similar to those obtained with purified TTR (data not
shown). In the studies on whole sera, affected and unaffected
family members were paired on the basis of similar serum
TTR concentrations (data not shown).

Protein binding studies. The lack of correlation between
TTR concentration and 125I-T4 precipitated by anti-TTR IgG
suggests that hyperthyroxinemia in these subjects is due to a
TTR with increased affinity for T4. To confirm this suggestion,
we performed equilibrium competitive binding studies with
125I-T4 and anti-TTR IgG on TTR purified from the proband's
plasma and from the plasma of a normal control subject (Fig.
6). As is apparent from the left panel in Fig. 6, the most striking difference between "affected" and normal TTR was the
amount of '25I-T4 bound in the absence of unlabeled T4. Scatchard analysis of competitive binding studies comparing purified TTR from the proband to TTR from a normal control
revealed that the proband's TTR bound T4 with an affinity
approximately three times that of control (Ka = 3.36±.76 [n

position 109. The HPLC chromatogram also contained a peptide 1 1-12' found in wild-type TTR which on sequencing revealed alanine at position 109. Thus, a single heterozygous
threonine-for-alanine substitution at position 109 of TTR is
associated with an increased affinity of this protein for T4 and
appears to account for the clinical syndrome of euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia in this kindred.
The adenine-for-guanine substitution in the mutant TTR

increased binding of '251I-T4 to TTR had the predicted mutation, we subjected DNA from the proband, four additional
affected family members, one unaffected relative, and three
normal controls to RFLP analysis of amplified exon 4 as detailed in Methods. The results of three affected family
members (including the son of the propositus [individual III 2,
Fig. 5]), one control, and one unaffected family member are
shown in Fig. 10. Based on this analysis, five of five of the
individuals predicted to have a threonine-for-alanine substitution have this substitution and none of the unaffected individuals display the loss ofthe Fnu 4H I site. Each affected individual also appears to be a heterozygote since both the 222- and
207-bp bands were present after Fnu 4H I digestion (Fig. 9).

Discussion
Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia is a relatively common clinical
condition. Most often, elevated serum thyroxine levels are due
to increased levels of TBG, but this situation usually is recognized easily due to the presence of a low T3RU or high TBG
level, either of which are part of the routine assessment of

thyroid status. Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia associated with a
normal T3RU is an uncommon condition caused either by
increased T4 binding to albumin, transthyretin, or gamma
globulin (8). These situations can present diagnostic dilemmas
since the elevated total T4 and normal T3RU result in an increased free T4 index consistent with thyrotoxicosis. Measured
free T4 and TSH should be normal. Most patients with this
condition have increased binding to albumin, due to a variant
albumin with an increased affinity for T4 (17-19). The molecular basis of the increased affinity of albumin for T4 is unresolved (20). Increased binding of T4 to IgG most often is seen
in the setting of autoimmune thyroid disease such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis (21). From the perspective of clinical management, the increasing availability of sensitive TSH assays to

Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia due to increased T4 binding
to transthyretin is a rare cause of an uncommon condition and
may result from an excess mass of normal transthyretin (2-4)
or from a transthyretin molecule with an increased affinity for
thyroxine (1, 5-7). Three reports of euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia due to elevated levels of TTR have been described (2-4);
all cases were in patients with pancreatic endocrine tumors. In
several cases, 1TR was identified by immunohistocytochemical staining of the tumor tissue (3, 4). In these patients, total T4
and FT4I concentrations were elevated modestly, the mea109

sured free T4, TSH, and T3 concentrations were normal, and
the TTR concentrations were elevated strikingly (from 4 to 10
times normal). In one patient in whom TTR binding capacity
and affinity were studied in whole sera subjected to agarose gel
electrophoresis, the maximal binding capacity for T4 was elevated, while the affinity for T4 was normal (4). Thus, it would
seem that in these patients hyperthyroxinemia is due to increased binding of T4 to a markedly elevated level ofTTR with
normal affinity for T4.
In 1982 we presented a preliminary report of the first case
of euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia due to a TTR with an apparent increased affinity for T4 (1). We described a patient with
elevated serum T4 and FI4I but with a normal total serum T3,
F[4, TSH, and TSH response to TRH. As measured by electrophoresis and immunoabsorption, this patient had an unusually high fraction of T4 associated with TTR. Though this
patient's TTR concentration was slightly elevated (66 mg/dl),
the patient's hyperthyroxinemia was thought to be unrelated
to the increased TTR concentrations, because the T4 binding
capacity of the serum TTR was normal, and the patient's son
had a similar phenotype with a normal serum TTR concentration. At that time, we had no direct evidence that the patient's TTR had an increased affinity for T4 and we had not
investigated the molecular basis of this abnormality. We now
report results confirming an increased affinity of TTR for T4
and demonstrating a point mutation in the coding region of
TTR DNA which probably accounts for this increased affinity
and the mode of inheritance of this mutation.
The use of anti-TTR IgG allowed us to isolate 125I-T4
bound to TTR from other thyroxine binding proteins in serum
and served as a convenient means to identify affected individuals in the kindred. Affected family members were defined on
the basis of the precipitation of 125I-T4 by anti-TTR IgG > 3
SDs above the mean for sera from six normal control subjects.
8 of 27 family members tested carried the mutant TTR gene
based on this definition and as confirmed by a T4-loaded T4
charcoal-uptake test and by paper electrophoresis (on 7 of the
8 affected family members). It is interesting to note that only
five of the eight affected family members had total T4 levels
above the upper limit of normal.
Each of the individuals tested demonstrated an increased
affinity of TTR for T4 as assessed by competitive binding

assays using whole sera. For the proband, this affinity was
three times greater than that of normal TTR and was confirmed with competitive binding studies performed with purified TTR. The available data support the concept that each
affected individual is heterozygous for this mutation and that
the mutation is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. None of the members ofthis kindred have been treated for
thyrotoxicosis and none except the proband had evidence of a
goiter. Based on the presence of a variant TTR molecule with
increased affinity for thyroxine we propose that this syndrome
be called euthyroid dystransthyretinemic hyperthyroxinemia.
Since investigation into the molecular basis of the increased affinity of TTR for T4 not only can establish the molecular basis of euthyroid dystransthyretinemic hyperthyroxinemia but also can provide some further insight into the nature of the molecular interaction between T4 and TTR, we
performed sequencing studies on both the TTR gene and protein in the proband of this kindred. DNA and protein sequencing both are consistent with a threonine-for-alanine
substitution in amino acid residue 109 of TTR. This is due to
an adenine-for-guanine substitution at the first base pair of the
codon for amino acid residue 109 in exon 4 of the TTR gene.
All five affected family members who were tested were heterozygous for this mutation based on RFLP analysis of PCR-amplified exon 4 of genomic DNA digested with the restriction
enzyme Fnu 4H I. While absolute proof of the relationship
between this threonine-for-alanine substitution will require direct testing of homozygous, recombinant TTRs, the lack of
other detectable defects in the coding region of TTR makes it
likely that this mutation is responsible for the increased affinity of TTR for T4.
Others have reported similar cases of hyperthyroxinemia
due to a TTR with increased affinity for thyroxine. One case of
euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia due to an increased fraction of
T4 associated with TTR as assessed by immunoprecipitation
was reported by Croxson et al. (7). Since the patient had only a
trivial elevation of his TTR concentration, Croxson et al. attributed the hyperthyroxinemia to an abnormal TTR with an
increased affinity for thyroxine, though direct studies to verify
this assumption were not undertaken. In 1984, Lalloz et al. (5)
reported a patient with dystransthyretinemic hyperthyroxinemia with normal TTR concentrations. They were able to

isolate this patient's TTR and show that it had an increased
affinity for thyroxine and reverse T3 as determined by equilibrium dialysis. Subsequently, Lalloz et al. (6) reported a patient
who had both dysalbuminemic and dystransthyretinemic hyperthyroxinemia. They were able to verify that both the patient's albumin and TTR had an increased affinity for thyroxine. In addition, they were able to show that these abnormalities were inherited independently in the patient's family as
autosom;al dominant traits. Further studies on one of these
dystransthyretinemic patients were reported in abstract form
by Fitch et al. (22). In this patient, a heterozygous point mutation in exon 2 encodes a serine-for-glycine substitution at
amino acid number 6 in the mature protein.
These are not the only examples of mutant TTRs with
altered affinity for thyroxine. Refetoff et al. (23) have examined the affinity of TTR for T4 in patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy secondary to defined mutations in
TTR (23). While none of these mutant TTRs demonstrated
increased affinity for T4, several demonstrated decreased affinity for T4. We have confirmed this finding and extended it
to additional TTR mutants using the '25I-T4 equilibrium competitive binding assay (24). Thus, a range of point mutations in
the TTR gene alter tl;e ability of TTR molecules to associate
with one another (to produce amyloid) and to associate with
thyroxine. Each of these different mutations provides further
insight into the molecular association of TTR with thyroxine.
It is interesting to speculate how mutation of Ala'09 to
Thr 09 described here affects TTR's affinity for T4. Amino acid
109 is situated at a domain that could perturb thyroxine binding in several different ways. The 3' outer ring iodine of thyroxine is projected to associate with the backbone oxygen of
Ala'09 (25, 26). It is not clear how the substitution of threonine
for alanine at this position alters the association with thyroxine
iodine. The methyl groups of Ala'08 and Leu0'° are thought to
form part of the hydrophobic patch of the thyroxine binding
site (25), and it is possible that a substitution in the amino acid
between them might slightly alter the relationship of these
amino acids and alter thyroxine binding. It also is possible that
the hydroxyl side chain of Thr " participates directly in the
binding of T4. Alternatively, Blake et al. (26) reported that
Ala"0 forms hydrogen bonds with Lys,'5 a residue that interacts with the side chain carboxylate of T4. Thus, it also is
possible that a threonine-for-alanine substitution at amino
acid 109 might result in some alteration in the configuration of
Lys"5 vis-a-vis T4. Clarification of the mechanism by which
this mutation increases TTR's affinity for T4 will be possible
with subsequent molecular modeling and crystallization of
homozygous mutant TTR. Additional information also may
come from binding studies with iodothyronine analogues.
In the family described here, TTR has a threefold increased
affinity for T4 compared with normal TTR. Yet, the affected
individuals are heterozygous for the mutant and normal TTR.
Normal TTR is a tetrameric protein comprised of four identical subunits. In the affected individuals, assuming that the
mutation will not affect the association of normal and mutant
monomers, we would predict that TTR in the circulation is
heterogeneous and consists of molecules with varying proportions of normal and mutant monomers. Thus, in these studies
we have measured T4 affinity to TTR molecules, the majority
ofwhich (93.75% based on random association of TTR monomers) contain at least one normal monomer. It is possible that
2032

Moses et al.

TTR tetramers consisting of four mutant monomers have
even a higher affinity for T4 than measured in our competitive
binding assays. Direct determination of T4 affinity by homozygous mutant TTR will have to await recombinant expression of this protein and should provide additional clues about
the molecular interaction between TTR and thyroxine and
about the association of TTR monomers themselves.
