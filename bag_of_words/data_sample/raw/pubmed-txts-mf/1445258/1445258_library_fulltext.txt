gradient of phenotypic severity

Type I collagen al(I) glycine to serine substitutions, resulting from G-to-A mutations, were defined in three cases of
osteogenesis imperfecta (01). The Gly substitutions displayed a gradient of phenotypic severity according to the location
of the mutation in the collagen triple helix. The most C-terminal of these, Gly565 to Ser, led to the lethal perinatal (type
II) form of 01, whereas the more N-terminal mutations, Gly415 and Gly352 to Ser, led to severe 01 (type III/IV) and
moderate 01 (type IVB) respectively. These data support the notion that glycine substitutions towards the C-terminus of
the al(I) or a2(I) chains will be more clinically severe than those towards the N-terminus. This results from the more
disruptive effect of the mutations at the C-terminus on helix initiation and C- and N-terminal helix directional
propagation. This generalization must be modified by considering the nature of the glycine substitution and the
surrounding amino acid sequence, since the helix is composed of subdomains of differing stability which will affect the
ability of helix re-nucleation and propagation.

INTRODUCTION

EXPERIMENTAL

Mutations in the genes for the proa(l) chains (COLIAJ) and
proa2(I) chains (COLIA2) of type I collagen have been defined
as& the molecular basis of the heritable connective tissue disorder,
osteogenesis imperfecta (01), in at least 90 % of cases studied to
date (for reviews see [1,2]). These mutations cover the gamut of
possible gene defects, including rearrangements, deletions, insertions and a spectrum of point mutations.
A relatively common type I collagen mutation in 01 is the
substitution of glycine residues within the helical domain of the
a l(I) and a2(I) chains. The occurrence of glycine in the triplet
amino acid repeating sequence Gly-Xaa-Xaa is critical for the
efficient formation and stability of the triple helix, the
functional unit of the extracellular collagenous matrix. The
substitution of any of these glycine residues disturbs helix
propagation, leading to increased levels of lysine post-translational modification, reduced collagen secretion, increased degradation and reduced helical stability [3-5]. It has been proposed
that glycine substitutions towards the C-terminus of the a-chains
will be more clinically severe than those towards the N-terminus,
consistent with the model that, since helix formation propagates
from the C- to N-terminus, those mutations towards the Cterminus will be more disruptive to helix formation [1]. The best
evidence in support of this comes from the al(I) Gly to Cys
mutations [1,2]. However, the correlation of mutation position
and clinical severity with other Gly substitutions is less clear, and
it is becoming apparent that the nature of the glycine substitution
and the surrounding amino acid sequence must be considered
[1,6]. Many more mutations spanning the collagen helical domain
will need to be characterized before any strict correlation can be
made between the biochemical and clinical phenotypes.
In this paper we define point mutations resulting in Gly to Ser
substitutions in the proal(I) chains of three cases of OI. The
most C-terminal of these, Gly565 to Ser, leads to the lethal
perinatal (type II) form of 01, whereas the more N-terminal
mutations, Gly4l5 and Gly352 to Ser, lead to severe 01 (type
III/IV) and moderate OI (type IVB) respectively.

Clinical summary
A male baby, 0139, died 6 h after birth from perinatal lethal
(type II) 01 [7]. 0158 had a severe form of 01 that was classified
as type III/IVB. She died unexpectedly at 19 months of age. She
had pale blue sclerae, dentinogenesis imperfecta, and severe
fragility and bowing of the long bones. 0168 has type IVB OI.
He is a 7-year-old boy with pale blue sclerae and dentinogenesis
imperfecta. He has moderately severe short stature, well-aligned
limbs, few fractures and a normal gait. Skin biopsies were
obtained from the patients, the parents of 0139 and 0168, and
controls with the approval of the Institutional Human Ethics
Committee.

Fibroblast collagen biosynthetic labelling
After culture for 3 days in growth medium containing 0.25 mmsodium ascorbate (Sigma), confluent fibroblast cultures were
labelled with 10 ,uCi of L-[5-3H]proline/ml (30 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) for 18 h in medium containing 10 % (v/v) dialysed
fetal calf serum (Flow Laboratories), 0.25 mM-sodium ascorbate
and 0.1 mM-/J-aminopropionitrile fumarate (Sigma) [4,5]. The
cell layer and medium fractions were separated for analysis and
the procollagens, precipitated with 25 %-saturated (NH4)2SO4,
were subjected to limited proteolysis with pepsin [4,5].

SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
Collagen a-chains were resolved on 5 % (w/v) polyacrylamide
separating gels containing 2 M-urea [4,5]. The a-chains were
detected by fluorography [8].
Thermal stability of collagen
The freeze-dried [3H]proline-labelled collagens were dissolved
in 0.4 M-NaCl/0. 1 M-Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 'C. The
samples were warmed stepwise (1 'C/min) from 34 'C to 43 'C,
and at 0.5 'C intervals samples were taken and digested with a
mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin [9]. The proportion of the
collagen that was resistant to proteolysis at each temperature

interval was determined by scintillation counting of collagen achain bands that were resolved by electrophoresis and identified
by fluorography [10]. The thermal denaturation temperature, Tm,
was defined as the temperature at which half of the collagen was
degraded.
Formation and chemical cleavage of mRNA:cDNA
heteroduplexes
Total RNA was isolated from confluent fibroblast cultures
[11,12]. mRNA cDNA heteroduplexes were formed in a volume
of 50 ,ul containing approx. 5 ng (50000-100000 d.p.m.) of
labelled cDNA probe, 5-10,ug of total RNA, 80 % (v/v) formamide, 40 mM-Pipes, pH 6.4, 1 mM-EDTA and 0.4 M-NaCl. The
mixture was denatured at 80 °C for 5 min, incubated at 60 °C for
2 h and ethanol-precipitated. Chemical modification of mismatched nucleotides with hydroxylamine or osmium tetroxide,
cleavage with piperidine and electrophoresis of the products on
denaturing 7 M-urea/5 % acrylamide gels have been described
[13-16].
The apparent site of the mutation in the collagen chains, based
on the localization of regional protein overhydroxylation, was
used as a guide to the selection of suitable control cDNAs for
heteroduplex formation. A control acl(I) cDNA probe, chosen to
span the abnormal region, was purified and end-labelled with
[a-32P]dCTP by the fill-in reaction using the Klenow fragment
of DNA polymerase I [17].
Amplification and sequencing of cDNA
First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using a
cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Corp.) primed with specific
oligonucleotide primers which were also used for PCR amplification. Approx. 50 ng of cDNA was amplified by the PCR [18]
through 30 cycles using Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer-Cetus)
[19]. Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 92 °C for 30 s,
annealing of primers at 64 °C for 1 min and primer extension at
72 °C for 3 min [15,16]. In samples from 0158 and 0168 a 466 bp
fragment corresponding to bases 1505-1970 [numbered from the
start of transcription of the proa(I) mRNA] of the al(I) cDNA
[20] was amplified with the primers 5'-TGCTGGAGAGGAAGGAAA-3' and 5'-TCCAGCCTCTCCATCTTT-3'. Sample 0139
was amplified with the primers 5'-AAGAGGCGAGAGAGGTTT-3' and 5'-GACCACTTTCACCCTTGT-3' to give a
332 bp fragment covering bases 2144-2475 of the al(I) cDNA
sequence.
Amplification products of the predicted size were purified,
treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase [17] and cloned into a
SmaI-cut dephosphorylated Ml 3mp8 vector (Amersham). Multiple clones of 0139 and 0158 DNA from independent amplification reactions were sequenced using a Sequenase kit (United
States Biochemical Corp.) and the M13 universal primer. The
amplification products of 0139 and 0168 were also directly
sequenced [21] using the primers 5'-GACCACTTTCACCCTTGT-3'(0139) and 5'-TGCTGGAGAGGAAGGAAA-

of the helix (results not shown). Fibroblast type I collagen
secretion was impaired and bone and dermal tissue showed a
reduction in type I collagen to approximately half control values
[5]. In the less severe cases, 0158 and 0168, fibroblast collagen
production was not reduced relative to age-matched control
fibroblasts and collagen secretion was not noticeably impaired
[22].
Electrophoretic analysis of the type I collagen produced by
fibroblast cultures from the parents of 0139 and 0168 showed
only normally migrating al(I) and a.2(I) chains (results not
shown). The parents of 0158 were unavailable for study.

Detection and sequencing of abnormal mRNA sequences
Heteroduplexes were formed using a control al(I) cDNA
2278 bp XhoI-XhoI fragment which spanned the central portion
of the collagen helix, and mRNA extracted from cultured 01 and
control dermal fibroblasts. Hydroxylamine/piperidine treatment
resulted in cDNA cleavage in all three cases, demonstrating the
presence of mismatched C nucleotides producing labelled cleavage fragments of control cDNA of 176 bp, 365 bp and 815 bp in
0168, 0158 and 0139 respectively (Figs. 2a and 2b). Treatment
with osmium tetroxide/piperidine did not reveal any T mismatches.
Hydroxylamine/piperidine treatment of heteroduplexes
formed with mRNA from fibroblast cultures of the parents of
0139 and 0168 indicated that the mutations were not present.
To define the mutations, short lengths of first-strand al(I)
cDNA were amplified by the PCR using unique oligonucleotides
chosen to span the regions containing the mismatches. For 0158,
sequencing of M 13 subclones of the amplified products identified
the mutation as a single base substitution at base pair 1896 which
converted the codon for glycine (GGC) to AGC (serine) at
amino acid position 415 (numbered by the standard convention
in which the first glycine of the triple helical domain of the achain is numbered one) of the helix (Fig. 3). The abnormal
sequence was confirmed by sequencing of multiple clones from
two separate PCR reactions. Clones containing the normal
sequence (GGC) were also identified, indicating that the patient
was heterozygous for the al(I) mutation.
In 0139, subcloning and sequencing identified a G to A
mutation at base 2346 of the proal(I) sequence, resulting in a

RESULTS

Collagen protein analysis
Three cases of 01 showed abnormal, slowly migrating type I
collagen al(I) and a2(I) chains when compared with age-matched
control fibroblast collagen a-chains (Fig. 1). The slow migration
in 0139 was directly demonstrated to be due to excessive levels
of post-translational hydroxylation of lysine [5]. Analysis of the
CNBr peptides of the al(I) chains showed that the overmodification was restricted to the al(I) CB8 and CB3 peptides,
suggesting that the underlying mutation was.in the central region

Fig. 2. Detection of the csl(I) mRNA mutations by chemical modification
and cleavage
Total RNA from control and 01 fibroblasts was hybridized to a
2278 bp XhoI-XhoI 32P-labelled fragment of the ol(I) cDNA and
reacted with hydroxylamine or osmium tetroxide for 0-60 min as
indicated, then treated with piperidine and the resultant fragments
resolved on a 5 % (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (see the Experimental
section for details). (a) In 0139, cleavage at mismatched and thus
reactive Cs by hydroxylamine (HA) produced a 815 bp labelled
fragment. OI62 has an undefined mutation resulting in different
cleavage fragment and is included as a chemical cleavage control for
the mismatch in 0139. Treatment with osmium tetroxide (OSO4),
which detects mismatched Ts, did not produce a cDNA cleavage.
32P-labelled molecular size markers of 255, 300, 397, 404, 427, 492,
598 and 1027 bp were produced by MspI digestion of the 21hydroxylase B gene. (b) In 0158 or OI68, cleavage at mismatched Cs
by hydroxylamine produced labelled fragments of 365 bp and 176 bp
respectively. No mismatched Ts were detected by OS04 treatment.
The chemical cleavage control was 0119, which contains no mutations in this region of the mRNA. 32P-labelled HaeIII fragments of

Fig. 4. Thermal denaturation of type I collagen
[3H]Proline-labelled collagens were prepared from the medium of
0145 and control fibroblasts. They were treated with pepsin, and
after inactivation of the pepsin the collagens were warmed slowly
from 34 °C to 43 'C. Serial samples were taken and digested with
trypsin/chymotrypsin, and the resistant chains were resolved by
electrophoresis. The melting temperature ofthe helix was determined
by the relative proportion of the a-chains that were resistant to
proteolysis (see the Experimental section for details).

(results not shown). In direct sequencing of the 0168 PCR
products, two alternatives (G and A) were also identified at base
pair 1707, demonstrating that this patient was also heterozygous
for a G to A transversion, resulting in the substitution of Gly352
by Ser in the product of the mutant allele.

Collagen melting temperature
Estimation of the thermal denaturation temperature (Tm) of
type I collagen synthesized by 01 and control fibroblasts was
made by measuring its resistance to proteinase digestion after
heating to different temperatures (Fig. 4). In all cases the Tm was
reduced relative to that of control type I collagen, but the
magnitude of this reduction was greatest in the clinically most
severe case, 0139. The Tm of 0139 type I collagen was approx.
39.0 °C compared with 40.9 °C for control type I collagen. In
0158 and 0168 the Tm was 40.5 °C and 40.4 °C respectively,
representing a decrease compared with controls of 0.4 °C and
0.5 °C respectively. Since the 01 cases were heterozygous, this
reduction in Tm probably represents an underestimate of the

134

reduction in the stability of the mutant type I molecules. The Tm
of 01 type III collagen was the same as in the control (results not
shown).
DISCUSSION
The three axl(I) point mutations in these cases of OI were
heterozygous for G to A transitions in glycine codons at base
pairs 1707, 1896 and 2346, resulting in Gly to Ser substitutions
at amino acids 352, 415 and 565. The mutations were away from
exon-intron boundaries and thus must represent COLIAJ point
mutations. In 0168 (Gly352 to Ser) and 0139 (Gly565 to Ser),
protein analysis demonstrated normal parental collagen. Furthermore, in 0139, analysis of amniotic cell collagen from a
subsequent pregnancy showed normal fetal collagen in twin
babies (J. F. Bateman & T. Mascara, unpublished work). These
data suggest that, as in the majority of other 01 cases [1,2], these
cases represented sporadic new mutations. Parental mosaicism
has been described in 01 [23,24] and was not formally discounted
in these cases.
These cases demonstrate a gradient of clinical severity from
the more C-terminal glycine-to-serine substitution (0139, Gly565)
leading to lethal perinatal 01, while mutations at Gly415 (0158)
and Gly352 (0168) lead to the progressively less severe forms of
01, type III/IV and type IVB respectively. The a-chains in all
three cases displayed high levels of lysine post-translational
modification due to disruption of helix propagation by the
glycine substitution, a common finding in 01 [3-5]. This retardation of helix propagation often results in decreased collagen
secretion and increased breakdown of the structurally abnormal
molecule [4,5,22]. Decreased secretion was evident in the most
severe case, 0139, but in 0158 and 0168 secretion was not
significantly impaired. Since correct helix formation is critical for
normal secretion, these data suggest that the mutations at Gly415
and Gly352 may not lead to as severe a structural abnormality of
the triple helix.
The differential effect of these mutations on helix structure was
also reflected in the decreased melting temperature of the type I
collagen. 0139 (Gly565 to Ser) had a 1.4 °C reduction in Tm, while
the less severe cases (Gly415 and Gly352 to Ser) had only a small
reduction in Tm of 0.4-0.5 'C. However, the overall correlation
of the extent of decrease of Tm with clinical severity has been
poor, with some clinically mild cases showing a more significant
reduction in helix stability than some lethal cases [2]. Ofparticular
interest in this regard is the lethal case Gly631 to Ser [25], where
the intact helix had a normal Tm but mammalian collagenase
subfragments show a reduced stability relative to controls.
There have been four other cases of acl(I) helix Gly to Ser
mutations characterized to date. These occur at Gly844 [26],
Gly832 [27], Gly631 and Gly598 [25]. Preliminary reports have been
made of a further five, at Gly'009, Gly1003 [28], Gly964 [1], Gly913
[28] and Gly460 [29]. These, in general, fit the pattern that the
more C-terminal the mutation, the more severe the clinical
consequences. There are, however, two cases of 01 with Gly to
Ser mutations which do not fit this simple model and argue that
a more comprehensive model must account for the effect of
specific regional sequences. GIy832 [27] and Gly844 [26] to Ser
mutations produce the milder type IV and type III phenotypes,
although mutations on the C- and N-terminal sides of these
produce the lethal phenotype.
These data further indicate that the model which considers the
collagen helix as a single functional unit in relation to helix
formation and stabilization is inappropriate, and a more detailed
model must consider the helix as being composed of subdomains
of differing stability. One such model considers these domains as
co-operative folding blocks [30] which result in non-linear helix

J. F. Bateman and others
formation and stabilization. The position of glycine mutations
within these sequence subdomains will thus have a critical role in
the effect of helix propagation on destabilization.
The possible effect of the local sequence in determining the
effect of the mutation on helical structure by providing domains
of relatively low or high local helix stability has been explored by
Bachinger & Davis [6]. Mutations in regions of low local stability
would be less deleterious to helical stability. Further, according
to this model, if sequences N-terminal to the mutation are of
high stability, re-nucleation of helix formation could occur
readily with minimal interruption to helix propagation. The nonlethal mutations at Gly832 and Gly844 are in such a region of
lower stability, with a region of higher stability immediately Nterminal [6]. Thus disturbance of the helix folding caused by the
mutations may be rescued by a relatively easy re-nucleation of
triple helix folding after the mutations. In contrast, the mutations
N-terminal to this region causing lethal 01 (Gly565, Gly598 and
Gly631) lack such N-terminal re-nucleation sites ([6]; H.P. Bach-

inger, personal communication).
Correlation of the nature of the molecular defect with the
clinical severity of01 remains an important goal. The devastating
effect of the glycine mutations on the collagenous matrix results,
at least in part, from the reduced secretion and increased
degradation induced by the defect. The degradation of molecules
containing a mutant al(I) consumes normal ccl(I) chains in the
same molecule [31] resulting, in the case of al (I) mutations, in the
destruction of as much as 75 % of the total collagen. In transgenic
mice expression of as little as 10 % of a Gly to Cys mutant a l(I)
gene resulted in a severe clinical phenotype [32], suggesting that
this destruction of mutant-containing type I collagen molecules
may not entirely account for the severity of the clinical consequences.
The explanation may lie in the highly organized molecular
packing of the collagen fibril, where a small structural abnormality in a relatively few secreted mutant collagen molecules
is amplified through the fibrillar architecture resulting in a
functionally abnormal matrix. An example of one such structural
abnormality was demonstrated by Vogel et al. [33]. In this case
of 01 a Gly784 to Cys mutation produced a flexible kink in the
triple helix which on incorporation into fibrils in vitro delayed
assembly and altered fibril morphology [34]. The overglycosylation of lysine induced by the mutation may also alter
the ability of the collagen to pack into the unit cell of fibril
structure. X-Ray diffraction studies on non-enzymic glycosylation of rat-tail tendon collagen fibrils has demonstrated a
resulting distortion of the unit cell [35]. The relevance of this
model to the relatively lower amount of overglycosylation that
occurs in 01 collagen is still uncertain.
The amplification of small structural distortions within the
collagenous fibrillar matrix may exert a profound influence on
the functional properties of the matrix. In particular, the molecular effect of these distortions on bone cell expression and
mineralization are important areas for further research.
