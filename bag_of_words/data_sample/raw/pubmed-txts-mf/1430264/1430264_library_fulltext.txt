Antithrombin III deficiency and cerebrovascular
accidents in young adults
J

A Graham, H M Daly, P J Carson

Abstract
A young man with antithrombin III (ATIII) deficiency sustained a cerebeilar
venous infarct and recovered following
treatment with AT-III concentrate. A family study showed that other members were
affected. AT-III deficiency in this family
was found to be due to a new variant ATIII TRURO 1.
Young patients with strokes should be
screened for thrombophilia.
(7 Clin Pathol 1992;45:921-922)

The incidence of cerebrovascular events in
young persons (25-40) is uncommon (2 per
10 000 per year)' and may be associated with
inherited thrombophilia of which the common
causes are protein C, protein S, and AT-III

deficiencies. Replacement therapy and long
anticoagulation may prevent venous
thromboembolism in affected persons.

Case report
A 37 year old man (fig 1 (I-IIb)) was admitted
with sudden onset of diplopia, dysarthria, and
headache followed by collapse. Examination
showed slight ataxia and rotatory nystagmus.
He was taking warfarin (INR 2 2) because an
underlying thrombotic defect had been suspected.

Eighteen months earlier a fractured tibia was
complicated by deep vein thrombosis and
pulmonary emboli. Up to 80 000 units of
intravenous heparin were required to achieve
satisfactory prolongation of his aplastic prothrombin time (APTT) (> 2-0) and before
achieving this he developed repeated pulmonary emboli, necessitating admission to the
intensive care unit.
After admission he became critically ill and
developed right cerebellar signs. A computed
tomogram of the head (with contrast) (fig 2)
showed a low density area in the right cerebellar hemisphere, effacement of the fourth
ventricle, and a characteristic "delta" sign (see
arrow). These appearances are highly suggestive of cerebellar venous thrombosis. The
patient was too ill for angiographic confirmation.
There was a strong family history of venous
thrombosis (table). Investigation of the patient
for an underlying thrombotic defect showed an
AT-III antigen concentration of 66% (normal
range 80-140%) and showed an activity level
of 68% (normal range 80-130%).
Warfarin was discontinued, because of the
risk of haemorrhage secondary to the infarct,
and heparin withheld because of the risk of a
further reduction in AT-III activity. He was
treated with AT-III concentrate daily to prevent
further venous thrombosis. AT-III concentrations were measured daily and AT-III concentrate was administered to achieve a 20 minute
postinfusion level of 100%. The dose was
calculated as follows:

(He received 820 units on day 1, 820 units 12
hourly on day 2, and 820 units on day 3). He
remained seriously ill and for several days his
survival was in doubt. However, within one
week he began to improve and was given long
term warfarin, aiming at an INR of 3 0-4 5.
He was discharged four weeks later and had
improved so much that his main concerns were
about future employment and ability to drive.
He remains fully active at the time of writing.

Discussion
Inherited AT-Ill deficiency was first described
in 1 965 3 and ''s known to predispose to
recurrent premature venous thromboembolism. Inheritance is autosomal dominant with
incomplete penetrance. This family exhibits
AT-Ill deficiency with low concentrations of
both antigen and bioactivity. Unlike haemophilia when only concentrations of less than
5% are associated with severe bleeding, AT-Ill
concentrations of less than 80% may be
associated with venous thromboembolism, as
in this family. Precipitating factors include
pregnancy, surgery., or trauma. By the age of
50., 70% of those affected will have had at least
one thrombotic event' which may be fatal.
T'he propositus was initially difficult to
anticoagulate with heparin., a feature of AT-Ill
deficiency., and a clue to the underlying
defect.
We report this case to highlight the need to
investigate young patients with cerebrovascular
events. AT-Ill is one of the potentially preventable and treatable causes of thromboembolic
disease and should be excluded. The propositus was already anticoagulated with warfarin
(INR-2.2) when he developed a cerebellar
venous infarct, but this proved inadequate.
Such patients should be maintained at a higher
level with an INR between 3-4.5.
Lifelong treatment with anticoagulants in
symptom free AT-Ill deficient patients is
unlikely to improve survival but once they have
developed overt thrombosis long term warfarin
is advised.' AT-Ill concentrate is available for
treatment of patients with an acute thrombotic
event, or prophylactically, when at maximum
risk-for example., at the time of delivery or
surgery; it reduces the risk of mortality and

morbidity.

Laboratory, Churchill Hospital, Oxford for supplying the
antithrombin III concentrate and for his helpful advice; Ms
Martina Daly and Dr D Perry, Department of Haematology,
