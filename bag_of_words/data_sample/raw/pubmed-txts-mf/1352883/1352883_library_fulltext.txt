ABSTRACT
The retinoblastoma-predisposition gene,
RBI, segregates as an autosomal dominant trait with high
(90%) penetrance. Certain families, however, show an unusual
low-penetrance phenotype with many individuals being unaffected, unilaterally affected, or with evidence of spontaneously
regressed tumors. We have used single-strand conformation
polymorphism analysis and PCR sequencing to study two such
families. Mutations were found in exon 20 of RB) in both cases.
In one family a C -- T transition in codon 661 converts an
arginine (CGG) to a tryptophan (TGG) codon. In this family,
incomplete penetrance and mild phenotypic expression were
observed in virtually ail patients, possibly indicating that single
amino acid changes may modify protein structure/function
such that tumorigenesis is not inevitable. In the second family
the mutation in codon 675 is a G -* T transversion that converts
a glutamine (GAA) to a stop (TAA) codon. However, this
mutation also occurs near a potential cryptic splice acceptor
site, raising the possibility of alternative splicing resulting in a
less severely disrupted protein.

Identification of unaffected mutant gene carriers has, until
recently, required that they have affected children, but use of
classical linkage analysis and restriction fragment length
polymorphisms (RFLPs) from within the RBI gene (8, 9) has
allowed unequivocal identification of cases of incomplete
penetrance in RB families (5, 6). In addition, patients with
typical retinal scarring and a strong family history also carry
a mutant RBI gene (5). This heterogeneity is difficult to
interpret in terms of the Knudson two-hit hypothesis, especially when the majority of gene carriers are only unilaterally
affected. We suggest that there are alleles of the RB) gene
that are only partially defective and, as a consequence, give
rise to a mild or incompletely penetrant phenotype. With the
cloning of RB) (10), it should now be possible to determine
the nature of mutations in low-penetrance families to establish whether they affect the gene in a distinct way or simply
reflect random mutation events throughout the gene.
RBI has a complex structure with 27 exons varying in size
from 31 to 1873 base pairs (bp) (11) and two very large
[>33-kilobase (kb)] introns. The sequences of intron regions
immediately adjacent to each exon have been determined
(11), allowing amplification of individual exons by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This approach has already been
used to identify mutations in RB tumors (12). Such a screening program can proceed more rapidly with analysis of each
exon of RBI by single-strand conformation polymorphism
(SSCP) analysis (13). This procedure depends on the sequence dependence of the migration of a single-stranded
DNA molecule in a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel.
Hence, mutations affecting a DNA sequence will lead to a
conformational change affecting mobility and produce novel
bands on gels.
We have used standard linkage analysis in RB families to
identify cases of incomplete penetrance and have undertaken
an exon-by-exon SSCP analysis combined with PCR sequencing to identify the specific mutation responsible for
mild phenotypes in two low-penetrance families.

Retinoblastoma (RB) is an intraocular eye tumor with an
incidence of 1 in 15,000-25,000 (1). It occurs predominantly
in children under the age of 2 years and is rare over the age
of 5 years. Approximately 15% of all RB patients have a prior
family history and the tumor phenotype segregates as an
autosomal dominant trait in most cases (1). In -10%o of
families, unaffected individuals can be identified who can
transmit the mutant gene (1). This phenomenon is referred to
as "incomplete penetrance."
Knudson (2) demonstrated that, in cases of hereditary RB,
a single, additional, random genetic event was required for
tumor development, and he provided one explanation of the
phenomenon of incomplete penetrance by suggesting that
these patients formed part of a Poisson distribution where, by
chance, the second random mutation did not occur. These
patients, however, still carry germ-line mutations and their
children have a 50% chance of inheriting the predisposing
mutation. Knudson's "two-hit" hypothesis also predicted
that mutant gene carriers would develop mostly multiple,
bilateral tumors with an earlier age of onset when compared
with sporadic cases, which would be mostly unilateral,
unifocal, and present later in life. However, the distribution
of cases of incomplete penetrance is not entirely random and
families have been reported where the majority of gene
carriers are either unaffected or only unilaterally affected
(3-6). These we refer to as "low-penetrance" families.
Another feature of RB is that it sometimes apparently regresses spontaneously, leaving characteristic scars on the
retina (4, 5). An alternative suggestion is that these scars
represent a more benign form of the disease, retinoma (7).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
PCR Amplification. Two primers were used to amplify a
350-bp fragment including the entire 146 bp of exon 20 and
flanking intron sequences. The 5' primer (no. 9438), 5'TTCTCTGGGGGAAAGAAAAGAGTGG-3', was located in
intron 19 and the 3' primer (no. 14928), 5'-AGTTAACAAGTAAGTAGGGAGGAGA-3', was located in intron 20. For
direct sequencing from PCR products either the biotinylated
version of primer 9438 (no. 18322) or a biotinylated internal
primer, 5'-CATGATTTGAAAAAAATCTACTTG-3' (no.

17295), was used with primer 14928. The 17295/14928 primer
pair amplifies a 269-bp fragment. This particular primer set
was also used to amplify exon 20 for Msp I digestion in family
RBF29.
PCR was carried out essentially as described by Hogg et al.
(14) with 30 cycles of denaturation at 940C for 20 sec,
annealing at 600C (for the 9438/14928 primer pair) or 520C (for
the 17295/14928 primer pair) for 20 sec, and extension at 720C
for 60 sec.
SSCP and Sequencing. Detailed methods for SSCP and
direct sequencing from PCR products have been described
(14). For SSCP, exon 20 was amplified using primers 9438 and
14928 in a PCR mixture with 1 ACi of [a-32P]dCTP (3000
Ci/mmol; Amersham; 1 Ci = 37 GBq) added and a nonradioactive dCTP concentration of only 0.02 mM. Denatured
samples were electrophoresed in nondenaturing 6% (wt/vol)
polyacrylamide/l0o (vol/vol) glycerol gels. For direct sequencing, primers 18322/14928 or 17295/14928 were used.
Primers 18322 and 17295 were biotinylated at the 5' end to
allow immobilization of single-stranded DNA on streptavi-

din-coated magnetic Dynabeads (Dynal; Merseyside, UK),
which were used to separate the DNA strands (14). Both
single strands were sequenced by using a Sequenase kit
(United States Biochemical) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.

RESULTS
Included in our SSCP analysis of a large number of patients
with hereditary RB were two families that showed an unusual
pattern of inheritance in that many individuals had "mild"
forms of the disease or were unaffected gene carriers. The
pedigrees of these two "low-penetrance" families, RBF29
and RBF18, are given in Fig. 1. In both cases, abnormal
banding patterns were seen in the SSCP gel for exon 20.
RBF29. Linkage analysis for family RBF29 (Fig. 1) was
reported previously (5). In this family there are six affected
individuals (1.1, 1.3, II.2, II.5, III.3, III.4), as well as four
unaffected gene carriers (11.4, 11.7, III.1, 111.2; arrows in Fig.
1) who were identified by using the RS2.0 polymorphism (5).

Genetics: Onadim et al.
The parents (11.3, 11.4) of the bilaterally affected twins (III.3,
III.4) are first cousins and each has a unilaterally affected
sister (II.2, II.5). The father ofthe twins (II.4) is an unaffected
gene carrier as are individuals 11.7, III.1, and III.2. After the
birth of (nonidentical) affected twins, the eyes of the grandparents, I.1 and 1.3, were examined and spontaneously
regressed tumors were identified in both.
Our preliminary screening program involved exon-by-exon
analysis of the RBI gene using SSCP in conjunction with PCR
sequencing. Extra bands were identified in exon 20 in the
DNA of individual II.4 from RBF29 in SSCP gels (Fig. 2) and
not in any of the other (20 out of 27) exons analyzed. In the
SSCP gel shown in Fig. 2 the 350-bp fragment encompassing
exon 20 amplified from II.4 exhibited an additional lower
band when compared with samples from other patients.
Sequence analysis of exon 20 from 11.4 in RBF29 (Fig. 3)
revealed a heterozygous C -* T transition in the coding
strand, 21 bases from the 5' end of exon 20. This mutation
converts codon 661 from an arginine (CGG) to a tryptophan
(TGG) codon. The same mutation was identified in the DNA
of all the affected members and unaffected gene carriers in
RBF29, but not in the unaffected members of the family. The
mutation in RBF29 occurs within an Hpa II/Msp I restriction
site in exon 20 (CCGG -- CTGG), so that the presence of an
undigested 269-bp fragment indicates a mutant gene carrier
(Fig. 4). The undigested 269-bp band was observed in the
DNA of all affected members and unaffected gene carriers,
whereas only the two smaller normal bands were seen in
individuals from this family identified not to be gene carriers
(Fig. 4). DNA from 111.5 was obtained for prenatal screening
from chorionic villus (CV) tissue and from cord blood samples (B) taken from the same individual at birth. Exon 20 from
II1.5 was also sequenced and found to be free of the 661
mutation, confirming our original prediction made with linkage analysis (15). Msp I digestions of exon 20 DNAs from 34
unrelated RB patients and 38 unrelated healthy individuals
did not show this mutation.
RBF18. Family RBF18, first reported by Hine (16), shows
eight affected individuals in the family (Fig. 1), three of whom
(I1.2, III.3, IV.1) had unilateral disease. Four generations of
males (I.1, II.4, III.3, IV.1) have a mild form of the disease.
Although I.1 had one eye removed for RB, the tumor in his
other eye regressed naturally. II.4 has spontaneously regressed tumors in both eyes and III.3 and IV.1 have unilateral
regressed tumors. II.1 and II.3, however, died at the age of
1 year 9 months and 3.5 years, respectively, as a result of

orbital extension (16) of their tumors. I.1 and II.2 died of
second tumors at the age of 61 and 40, respectively. Only
DNA from individuals III.2, III.3, III.4, and IV.1 was available to us. The RB predisposition is linked to the 4.95-kb
allele in the RO.6 polymorphism (6).
SSCP analysis of DNA from III.3 from RBF18 showed an
additional upper band (Fig. 2) when compared with other
samples. Sequence analysis of exon 20 from 111.3 (Fig. 5)
revealed a heterozygous G -- T transversion in the coding
strand, 63 bases from the 5' end of exon 20. This mutation
converts codon 675 from a glutamine (GAA) to a stop (TAA)
codon. However, 3 bp downstream of this mutation lies a
TAG sequence (Fig. 6), which is compatible with a consensus
splice acceptor sequence (17). The G -- T transversion
removes an AG dinucleotide (converting it to AT) that
ordinarily would have prevented the downstream TAG sequence from becoming a splice acceptor site. In addition, this
transversion increases the pyrimidine/purine ratio in the
region immediately preceding the TAG site, thereby enhancing its potential to be a cryptic splice site (18). A branch-point
sequence exists (Fig. 6) upstream of this cryptic site, which,
although not as good as the real branch point in intron 19,
would nevertheless be adequate if this site were activated. In
this case, the reading frame would be intact but the first 23
amino acids encoded by exon 20, codons 654-676, would be
lost. Such a deletion would disrupt the leucine zipper motif
in exon 20, removing 3 of the 4 leucines. The same mutation
was identified in the DNA of III.2 and IV.1, who were known
to carry the RB-predisposition gene. III.4, who is an unaffected normal individual, has the normal sequence. This G -+
T mutation does not alter any known restriction enzyme site.

described seem to be randomly distributed throughout the
(12, 19). The majority of these mutations in bilaterally,
multifocally affected individuals cause major disruptions of
the gene and its consequent processing, resulting in nonproduction of the RB protein (20). The exact role of RBI in
tumorigenesis is still not fully understood, but its product,
RB1, seems to be part of a signaling pathway controlling cell
proliferation (21). The RB1 protein interacts with the transforming oncoproteins of DNA tumor viruses (22-24). The
domains of RB1 that bind these proteins are encoded by
exons 13-17 and 18-22, amino acids 393-572 and 646-772,
respectively (25, 26). It has been suggested that, with appropriate folding of RB1, a "pocket" is created that facilitates
binding to the viral transforming proteins and endogenous
cellular proteins (27). The observation that RB) mutations
exist that produce proteins which fail to bind viral proteins or
to associate with endogenous cellular proteins has led to the
suggestion that this pocket contributes to the growthregulatory function of RB1 (27-30).
Recently, mutations in the promoter region of RB) were
detected in two families with low-penetrance phenotypes
(31). A plausible explanation for this is that promoter mutations may result in reduced levels of RB1. In many cells the
production of sufficient RB1 protects them against tumorigenesis, but occasionally a cell produces insufficient RB1,
thereby escaping its normal growth control. Since promoter
mutations were not found in a large number of other families

exhibiting a similar phenotype, one would assume that alternative possibilities exist. Subtle changes in the RB1 amino
acid sequence, for example, may reduce only its functional
efficiency, and only when a threshold level of activity is not
maintained do tumors develop. The mutation in family
RBF29 is possibly one such example with only a single amino
acid change. Why, then, did the twins in this family develop
multifocal disease? In 70% of tumors the initial mutation is
duplicated (32, 33) in tumor precursor cells. Duplication of a
"weak" mutation might still result only in a mild phenotype
but if, as in 30% of tumors, the second mutation is more
serious the combination could result in multifocal tumor
formation. Such independent somatic mutations have been

identified in tumors from bilaterally affected RB patients (19).
The tumors from RBF29 family members, however, were
successfully treated and so not available for analysis.
Whether subtle changes anywhere in the gene would result in
a mild phenotype or whether specific regions, such as exon
20, are more important is not clear. The only other amino acid
substitution reported in RB tumors was in exon 18, and that

patient was bilaterally affected (12).
It is interesting that the other family in our study showing
a low-penetrance phenotype also has a mutation in exon 20.
At first sight it appears that the mutation in RBF18 results in
the generation of a stop codon, which could not be described
as a mild mutation since the protein would be missing 254
amino acids at the C-terminal end. However, the mutation
also alters the DNA sequence, potentially generating a cryptic splice acceptor site in that region. Under normal circumstances, in the presence of cis competition with the normal
site, cryptic sites are never used. A change in the local
sequence environment, however, can change the splicing
pattern (34). In a cis-competition assay for splice-site selection, Reed and Maniatis (34) showed that sequences located
downstream from intron 1 in the human f-globin gene splice
acceptor site, for example, can have a profound effect on the
efficient use of the adjacent splice site. Moreover, they found
that the interaction between factor(s) present in a splicing
extract and the splice sites is affected by exon sequences,
which may play a key role in distinguishing between normal
splice sites and cryptic splice sites located throughout premRNAs. A mutation in the exon sequence, therefore, might
improve the chances of recognition and/or the affinities of
splicing components for the cryptic site, thus giving rise to a
stronger and more stable splice complex. It is possible that
under some circumstances, or in a specific cell type, the
cryptic site is used either exclusively or in combination with
the real site. However, many factors affect splicing and,
without a functional assay, it is difficult to predict the
outcome. For example, a G -- T transversion in exon 22 of
the RB) gene in the small-cell lung cancer cell line NC1-H69C
simultaneously created a stop codon and a novel splice donor
site (20). However, the mutation must have also influenced
the normal splice acceptor site immediately upstream of exon
22, as it resulted in the removal of the entire exon.
It is possible, therefore, that the RBF18 mutation could
have similar consequences. We do not have access to RNA
from this family to investigate this possibility. It is also
difficult to assess functional properties of protein(s) thus
produced. There have been reports of shorter RB proteins,
resulting from in-frame deletions of exons 20-22, with impaired biochemical properties (27, 28, 30, 35, 36). Sheffner et
al. (37) reported that a 4-amino acid deletion resulting from a
splice acceptor-site mutation in exon 20 in a cervical carcinoma cell line produced defective RB1. It is not clear,
however, what the functional consequences of such protein(s) would be in a developing retinal cell.
The RB) gene seems to have a variety of

functions,
depending on the stage of development and cell type. The
effect of naturally occurring RBI mutations on this expanding

repertoire of RB1 activities has not been investigated, but it
is conceivable that particular mutations-for example, amino
acid substitutions in particular regions of the gene-rather
than abolishing the function of RB1, modify it so that it works
less efficiently. One consequence of this modification might
be that only occasionally is there insufficient RB1 to prevent
tumorigenesis. Alternatively, once initiated the transformed
phenotype might be overcome by subsequent adequate production of RB1-for example, through alternative splicing
where stop codons are involved-resulting in regressed/
benign tumors. To clarify this situation, more families of the
low-penetrance phenotype need to be analyzed for their
mutations.
