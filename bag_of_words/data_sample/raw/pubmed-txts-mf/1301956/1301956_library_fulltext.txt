The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is a cell surface transmembrane protein that mediates the

uptake and lysosomal degradation of plasma LDL, thereby providing cholesterol to cells. Mutations
disrupting the function of this receptor produce autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia
(FH). Affected individuals have elevated plasma levels of LDL, which causes premature coronary
atherosclerosis. To date, 7 1 mutations in the LDL receptor gene have been characterized at a molecular
level. In this report, we describe 79 additional mutations and review the insights that all 150 mutations
have provided into the structure/function relationship of the receptor protein and the clinical manifestations of FH. 0 1992 WiIepLiss, Inc.

INTRODUCTION

LDL receptor alleles (true homozygotes), while oth-

The cell surface receptor for low-density lipoprotein (LDL)' removes cholesterol-carrying LDL from
plasma via receptor-mediated endocytosis (Brown
and Goldstein, 1986). Mutations in the LDL receptor gene produce familial hypercholesterolemia
(FH), a common autosomal dominant disorder
that affects about 1in 500 individuals. The receptor
defect impairs the catabolism of LDL, and the
resultant elevation in plasma LDL-cholesterol promotes deposition of cholesterol in the skin (xanthelasma), tendons (xanthomas), and coronary arteries (atherosclerosis) (Goldstein and Brown, 1989).
FH occurs clinically in two forms. FH heterozygotes, who inherit one mutant LDL receptor allele,
manifest a 2- to 3-fold elevation in plasma LDLcholesterol and typically develop premature coronary heart disease after age 35. In the United States
and Western Europe, about 5% of all individuals
who have a myocardial infarction before age 60 are
FH heterozygotes (Goldstein et al., 1973). FH homozygotes, who inherit two mutant LDL receptor
alleles, are rare (1 in lo6 individuals) and have a
more severe clinical picture. Their plasma concentrations of LDL-cholesterol are elevated 6- to
8-fold, and they often die of myocardial infarctions
during the first two decades of life. Some phenotypic FH homozygotes inherit two identical mutant

ers inherit two different mutant Blleles (compound
heterozygotes). For the sake of simplicity, individuals who have two mutant LDL receptor alleles,
whether identical or not, are referred to as FH
homozygotes.
Over the past 20 years, we have maintained
fibroblast cultures from 170 unrelated FH individuals, including 157 homozygotes and 13 heterozygotes. These cultures were initiated from skin biopsies sent to Dallas by 100 physicians from 14
different countries. These fibroblast strains, referred to as the Dallas collection, have allowed us
to perform a systematic structure/function analysis
of LDL receptor mutations at multiple levels, including the intact cell, the isolated protein, and the
cloned gene.
The human LDL receptor cDNA and gene were
cloned and characterized in 1984 and 1985, respectively (Yamamoto et al., 1984; Sudhof e t al., 1985).

"Oppositely oriented 25-base oligonucleotides complementary to DNA sequences flanking the promoter and exons of the human LDL
receptor gene were synthesized on an AB1380B DNA synthesizer (AppliedBiosystems, Foster City, CA) and used to amplify the intervening
sequences with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Mullis and Faloona, 1987). Each PCR reaction was performed in 20 )LI containing
0.1 pg genomic DNA, 20 pmol of each primer, 1nmol dNTPs, 3.3 pmol of [3ZP]dCTP(3000 Ciimmol),and 2 U of DNA polymerase Themus
oquah'cus(Promega, Madison, WI)in 10 mM Tris-CI (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCI, and 1.5 mM MgCI,. Each PCR reaction was overlaid with mineral
oil and subjected to 30 cycles at 96°C for 1 min and 68°C for 5 min in a thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Nowalk, CT). A total of 1 p1
of the reaction was diluted in 30 )LI of formamide dye [98% (viv)formamide, 50 mM sodium EDTA. 0.01% (w/v)xylene cyanol, and 0.01%
(wiv)bromophenol blue] and boiled for 3 min. An aliquot (2 pl) was subjected to electrophoresis (300 V for 14 hr at room temperature)
on a 6.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 2 x TBE (10x TBE = 0.5 M Tris-chloride, 0.5 M boric acid, and 10 mM sodium EDTA
at pH 8.2) and 10% (v/v) glycerol (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ). Each gel was dried and exposed to XAR-5 film for 12 hr at 24°C.

Shortly thereafter, the first molecular characterization of an LDL receptor mutation was reported
(Lehrman et al., 198%). In the ensuing 5 years,
from 1985 to 1990, a total of 42 mutations, including 33 from the Dallas collection, were characterized genetically and biochemically, and these
data are reviewed in Hobbs et al. (1990). Owing to
the development of improved molecular techniques
to detect single base pair (bp) changes in DNA, we
have witnessed, in the last 2 years, an exponential
acceleration in the molecular identification of mutations in the LDL receptor gene, bringing the total
to 71. In this paper, we describe the molecular and
cell biological characterization of 79 new LDL receptor mutations that were identified in the Dallas
collection. We estimate that the Dallas collection
contains as many as 190 mutant alleles, 112 of
which have now been characterized at a molecular
level.
The 79 new LDL receptor mutations reported in
this paper were identified through use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Mullis and Faloona,
1987) and the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)technique (Orita et al, 1989a). Each

of the 18 exons of the LDL receptor gene was amplified and labeled uniformly with 32P using PCR
and oppositely oriented 25-base oligonucleotides
complementary to intron sequences that flank the
exons. The sequences of these oligonucleotides and
the conditions for amplification are given in Table
1 and its legend. The amplified fragments were
denatured'and size-fractionated o n a 6.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel as described by Orita et
al. (1989b). The aberrantly migrating PCR fragments were sequenced directly (Lee, 1991),and the
mutation identified. In this paper, the newly described 79 mutations are reviewed together with all
other molecularly characterized receptor mutations
reported in the literature as of September 1, 1992,
bringing the total number to 150.
LDL RECEPTOR GENE STRUCTURE
The LDL receptor gene (Fig. l ) , located o n the
distal short arm of chromosome 19 (p13.1-p13.3),
spans 45 kilobases (kb), is comprised of 18 exons
and 17 introns (Hobbs et al., 1990 for review).
Exon 1 encodes the signal sequence. Exons 2-6 encode the ligand binding domain, which consists of

seven tandem repeats of a 40-amino acid, cysteinerich sequence. Exons 7-14 encode a region that
shares sequence identity to the human epidermal
growth factor (EGF) precursor gene. This domain
contains three 40-amino acid, cysteine-rich growth
factor repeats (designated A, B, and C). The A and
B repeats (encoded by exons 7 and 8) are separated
from the C repeat (encoded by exon 14) by five
copies of a 40-60 amino acid repeat (encoded by
exons 9-13). Each of these five repeats contains a
conserved motif, Tyr-Trp-Thr-Asp (YWTD). Exon
15 encodes a 58-amino acid sequence that is the
attachment site for many 0-linked carbohydrate
chains. Exon 16 and the 5’-end of exon 17 encode
22 hydrophobic amino acids that anchor the protein to the cell membrane. The remainder of exon
17 and the 5’-end of exon 18 encode the cytoplasmic domain that contains the signal that clusters
the receptor in clathrin-coated pits, allowing it to
be internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis.
Transcription of the LDL receptor gene is regulated by feedback suppression mediated by the endproduct, intracellular cholesterol. The 5’-flanking
region of the LDL receptor gene contains most, if
not all, of the cis-acting DNA sequences responsible
for the sterol-regulated expression of the gene in

Spanning

animal cells (Goldstein and Brown, 1990; Smith et
al, 1990). Within 200 bp of the initiator methionine codon are three imperfect 16-bp direct repeats
(repeats 1 through 3), two N T - r i c h sequences
(TATA boxes), and a cluster of mRNA initiation
sites, all of which function in transcription. Repeats
1 and 3 interact with transcription factor Spl to
promote transcription, but they themselves are not
sufficient for high-level expression. They require
the contribution of the other direct repeat (repeat
2), which contains a conditional-positive sterol regulatory element, termed SRE-1, that is 10 bp in
length. This element enhances transcription when
cellular sterols are low, and its effect is abolished
when sterols accumulate within cells.

LDL RECEPTOR MUTATIONS
Of the 150 naturally occurring LDL receptor
mutations characterized at a molecular level, 127

(including 112 from the Dallas collection) have
been subjected to structure-function characterization, including analysis of binding and uptake of
LDL, receptor biosynthesis, receptor transport, and
gene structure. The remaining 23 mutations include deletions and insertions that have been
mapped by Southern blotting or molecular cloning,

but have not been analyzed at the level of receptor
biosynthesis or function. The 150 mutations are
summarized in Tables 2 and 3 and Figures 1 and 2.
The mutations identified in the Dallas collection
are denoted by a dagger (t)in Tables 2 and 3. T h e
79 mutations reported in this paper are denoted by
a section sign (3) in Table 2.
In the Dallas collection, 60% of the 157 unrelated FH homozygotes are compound heterozygotes, as assessed by RFLP and mutational analysis
(Hobbs e t al., 1990; unpublished data). Many of
the true homozygotes are from populations known
to be inbred, owing to founder effects or geographic/cultural isolation (discussed below).
Functionally, the LDL receptor mutations have
been classified into 5 classes based o n biosynthetic
and functional studies of fibroblast cell strains derived from skin biopsy specimens (Brown and
Goldstein, 1986; Hobbs et al., 1990). The LDL
receptor alleles that make up each of the 5 functional classes are discussed below. It should be emphasized that these classifications are somewhat arbitrary since many LDL receptor alleles produce
proteins that fall into more than a single class. For
example, many transport-defective receptors are
also binding-defective.
Class 1 Mutations: Null Alleles
Class 1 mutations fail to produce immunoprecipitable LDL receptor protein (null alleles). Approximately 17% of the 157 FH homozygote fibroblast strains in the Dallas collection have two null
alleles of the Class 1 type. These cell strains exhibit less than 2% of the normal amount of high
affinity binding, uptake, and degradation of 1251LDL. Thirty-six null alleles have been characterized at the molecular level. The most frequent
types of Class I mutations are nonsense and frameshift mutations, and these are randomly distributed
among the exons (Figs. 1 and 3A). These mutations produce mRNA that is normal in size, but
reduced in concentration (Hobbs et al., 1988).
The absence of receptor protein in these cells may
be due to a rapid turnover of the mRNA as occurs
with some nonsense mutations at the (3-globin locus (Trecartin et al., 1981) or to accelerated degradation of the receptor protein. Three Class 1
alleles contain deletions that include the LDL receptor promoter region (Fig. 2, Numbers 1-3).
These alleles produce no mRNA or protein. Six
Class 1 alleles generate receptor mRNAs of abnormal size, two caused by splicing mutations (Table
1, FH Tunis and FH Niigata) and four by large
deletions (Fig. 2, Numbers 29-31 and 33).

453

Class 2 Mutations: Transport Defective Alleles
Class 2 mutations are the most common at the
LDL receptor locus; 54% of the cell strains in the
Dallas collection have at least one allele with a
Class 2 phenotype. Class 2 alleles encode proteins
that are blocked, either completely (Class 2A) or
partially (Class 2B) in transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus
(transport-defective alleles). The normal receptor
is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum as a
partially glycosylated precursor that migrates with
an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa (Goldstein
et al., 1985 for review). Within 60 min the receptor is transported through the Golgi, where the Nand O-linked sugars are processed. Coincident
with processing, the apparent molecular mass of
the receptor protein increases to 160 kDa. In Class
2 fibroblasts in which transport to the Golgi is
abolished (Class 2A alleles), the apparent molecular mass of the receptor remains at 120 kDa.
Forty-nine Class 2 alleles have been characterized at the DNA level. Two-thirds of these mutations are located in the ligand-binding domain and
one-third in the EGF precursor homology domain.
The mutations are not evenly distributed between
the ligand binding repeats, but show a striking clustering in repeat 5 (Fig. 3B). As discussed below,
repeat 5 is unique among the seven ligand binding
repeats in that its structural integrity is required for
binding of both of the receptor’s ligands.
Most of the Class 2 mutations within the ligand
binding domain are missense mutations that involve amino acid residues that are highly conserved
among multiple animal species (Mehta e t al.,
1991), especially the invariant cysteine residues
and the negatively charged Asp-X-Ser-Asp-Glu
consensus sequence located at the 3’ end of each
repeat. In-frame deletions and insertions within the
ligand binding domain also can result in a Class 2
phenotype presumably by interfering with disulfide
bond formation and preventing correct folding of
the receptor during synthesis in the endoplasmic
reticulum.
Most of the remaining Class 2 mutations are
located in the EGF precursor homology domain.
This is the most highly conserved domain in the
receptor protein (Mehta et al., 1991), and its
structure is easily disrupted if only a single amino
acid is changed. Of the nine alleles that produce a
complete block in transport of the receptor protein
(Class 2A), eight are located within this domain.
As will be discussed below, the Class 2 LDL
receptor mutations are illustrative of an emerging

LDL RECEPTOR MUTATIONS
class of mutations involving membrane and secretory proteins that cause human disease.
Class 3 Mutations: Binding Defective Alleles
The LDL receptor has two major physiological
ligands: LDL, which binds to the receptor by virtue
of its single apoB-100; and intermediate density
lipoprotein (IDL, also referred to as p-migrating
very low-density lipoprotein or p-VLDL), which
binds to the receptor by means of its multiple copies of apoE. The LDL receptor has a higher affinity
for p-VLDL (which contains multiple copies of
apoE and a single copy of apoB-100) than for LDL
(which contains one copy of apoB-100 and no
apoE) (Mahley et al., 1986). Class 3 mutations
encode proteins that are synthesized and transported to the cell surface, but fail to bind LDL
normally (binding-defective alleles). Some of
these mutant proteins retain the ability to bind

p-VLDL.

Deletional analysis by in vitro mutagenesis revealed that each of the cysteine-rich binding repeats in the ligand binding domain makes an independent contribution to ligand binding and that
replacement of a single conserved amino acid in a
repeat produces the same functional abnormality as
does deletion of the entire repeat (Russell et al.,
1989). Deletion of repeat 1 has no effect on binding of either LDL or P-VLDL. Deletion of any
other single repeat impairs LDL binding by up to
95%, but does not impair the binding of p-VLDL.
The sole exception is repeat 5, whose deletion reduces p-VLDL binding by 50%. A likely explanation for the observed clustering of Class 2 mutations in repeat 5 (Fig. 3B) is one of selection bias.
These mutations probably produce a more severe
clinical phenotype, owing to the fact that the reduced number of receptors that reach the cell surface are defective in binding IDL (or P-VLDL) as
well as LDL. Class 2B mutations that affect other
repeats may retain normal IDL binding and thus
may produce only a mild elevation of LDL in
plasma.
Eleven Class 3 alleles produce receptors that are
transported to the cell surface normally, but are
defective in ligand binding. All are caused by inframe insertions or deletions in the ligand binding
or EGF precursor homology domains. The binding
characteristics of each of these mutant receptors
mimics the results of the in vitro mutagenesis studies (Russell et al., 1989). For example, deletion of
repeat 6, as in FH-Paris I , produces a receptor that
fails to bind LDL (apoB-100) but binds P-VLDL
(apoE) with normal affinity (Hobbs et al., 1986).

457

Class 4 Mutations:
Internalization-Defective Alleles
Class 4 mutations encode receptors that move
to the cell surface and bind LDL normally, but are
unable to cluster in clathrin-coated pits and thus
do not internalize LDL (internalization-defective
alleles). The seven Class 4A mutations have been
subclassified into two groups: mutations that alter
the cytoplasmic domain alone (Class 4A) and mutations that involve the cytoplasmic domain together with the adjacent membrane-spanning region (Class 4B) (Hobbs et al., 1990). The most
informative Class 4A mutation is the 1.0. allele
(FH Bari allele) in which a single bp change substitutes a cysteine for tyrosine at position 807 in
the cytoplasmic domain (Davis et al., 1986). This
position must be occupied by an aromatic amino
acid (tyrosine, phenylalanine, or tryptophane) in
order for internalization to occur normally (Davis
et al., 198713). TyrBO7
is part of a tetrameric signal
sequence NPVY (Asn-Pro-Val-Tyr) that is conserved in LDL receptors from six animal species
(Chen et al., 1990) and targets the LDL receptor
protein to the coated pit.
The second subclass of internalization-defective
alleles (Class 4B) produce truncated receptors that
lack the membrane-spanning domain as well as the
cytoplasmic tail. Most of these molecules are secreted from the cell, but approximately 10% remain adherent to the cell membrane where they
bind LDL but do not internalize it. The three Class
4B mutant alleles have deletions that extend from
intron 15 to the noncoding region of exon 18. The
truncated intron 15 is not removed by splicing, so
translation extends into intron 15 which produces
an abnormal COOH-terminal sequence that contains 55 novel amino acids (Lehrman et al.,
1987b). This sequence includes a cluster of 14 hydrophobic amino acids but not an NPVY signal so
the mutant receptors adhere to the cell membrane,
but cannot be internalized.
Class 5 Mutations: Recycling-Deficient Alleles
Class 5 mutations encode receptors that bind
and internalize ligands in coated pits, but fail to
release the ligands in the endosome and thus do
not recycle to the cell surface (recycling-defective
alleles). A total of 22% of the fibroblast strains in
the Dallas collection have a Class 5 phenotype,
including 11 missense mutations, all of which occur in the EGF precursor homology domain (Fig.
3C). This domain mediates acid-dependent dissociation of receptor and ligand in the endosome, an
event that is essential for receptor recycling (Davis

et al., 1987a). If the ligand is not released from the
receptor in the endosome, the receptor-ligand
complex is degraded, and the receptor fails to be
recycled to the cell surface.
The Class 5 mutations cluster in the 5' end of
the EGF precursor homology domain, especially in
the first YWTD repeat (Repeat Y1 in Fig. 3C).
This finding is likely related to the finding that the
A and B growth factor repeats at the 5' end of this
domain play an essential role in recycling the receptor to the cell surface, even in the absence of
ligand (Davis et al., 1987a; van der Westhuyzen et
al., 1991).

small target size of DNA (200 bp) that is essential
for transcriptional regulation (discussed below).

Promoter Mutations

To date, only three naturally occurring mutations (two missense mutations and one 3-bp deletion) have been mapped to the transcriptional regulatory elements of the LDL receptor gene, and all
involve one of the two S p l binding sites. The low
frequency of this class of mutation reflects the

POPULATION GENETICS
Founder Effects

In most populations of the world, the frequency
of heterozygous FH is -0.2%, and a plethora of
different mutations are responsible for the disease.
However, in certain populations of the world a
small number of mutations predominate due to
founder effects. These populations include Ashkenazi Jews of Lithuanian descent, Afrikaners,
French Canadians, Christian Lebanese, Druze,
Sephartic Jews, and Finns. In some of these populations, the frequency of FH is much higher than
0.2%. Table 4 lists the most frequent mutant alleles in these populations.

nic backgrounds. To determine whether the two
individuals inherited the same mutant allele from a
common ancestor or if the mutation occurred
twice, the RFLP haplotypes of the two alleles were
compared using 10 previously defined RFLPs
(Hobbs et al., 1990; Leitersdorf et al., 1989a). In
nine cases, the two alleles had different RFLP haplotypes and thus were likely recurrent mutations.
These mutations are denoted by the superscriptj in
Table 2. Three of the nine possible recurrent mutations result from a cytosine (C) to thymidine (T)
transition at a CpG dinucleotide, a frequent cause
of mutations in the human genome (Cooper e t al.,
1988). At the LDL receptor locus, 16% of the
point mutations are C to T substitutions at CpG
dimers; these mutations are demarcated by superscript m in Table 2.
DIAGNOSTIC RELEVANCE

In the French Canadian, Christian Lebanese,
Finnish, Afrikaner, and Ashkenazi Jewish populations, it is now feasible to screen for FH at the
DNA level and thereby to detect the mutation

responsible for the majority of FH (Table 5 ) . However, in most populations of the world, including
the populations of North America and Europe,
more than 150 different mutations produce FH. In
these populations, the molecular diagnosis of FH
can be made through linkage analysis in families
with the use of RFLP polymorphisms. Numerous
RFLP polymorphisms have been identified that
span the entire LDL receptor locus, and these can
be used to construct haplotypes (Leitersdorf e t al.,
1989a). In families with FH, haplotype analysis
can be employed to follow the segregation of the
LDL receptor gene and establish or confirm the
diagnosis of FH.
INSIGHTS FROM LDL RECEPTOR MUTATIONS
The following information of general biological
importance has emerged from the molecular analysis of LDL receptor mutations:
Alu Repeats and Gene Rearrangements

A h repeats are the predominant “middle repetitive” DNA sequences in the mammalian genome.

460

HOBBS ET AL.

The human genome contains about 9 10,000 copies
of these 300-bp repeat sequences (Hwu e t al.,
1986). Alu sequences are distributed throughout
all chromosomes, occurring mostly in intergenic
regions and in introns (Jelinek et al., 1982), but
occasionally in the 3’-untranslated regions of mRNAs as in the LDL receptor (Yamamoto e t al.,
1984). They are thought to have arisen by duplication and recombination of a small number of
founder repeats (Britten et al., 1988). Alu repeats
can be transcribed by RNA polymerase 111, which
recognizes sequence blocks (A and B) in each arm
that act as a bipartite promoter as in 5 S ribosomal
RNA genes and tRNA genes (Jelinek et al.,
1982). The large number of Alu repeats in the
human genome, coupled with their capacity to be
transcribed into RNA, has led to the idea that
these sequences might serve as sites for genome
rearrangements (Britten et al., 1988). This hypothesis has received its strongest support from the
almost invariant finding of Alu sequences at the
junctions of large rearrangements in the LDL receptor gene (Hobbs et al., 1990 for review).
Of the 45 large deletions and insertions in the
LDL receptor gene reported to date, the deletionjoints have been sequenced in 10 (Fig. 2). Nine of
these 10 possess an Alu repeat at one or both mutation endpoints. Most commonly, the two Ah
repeats found at the deletion (insertion) breakpoints are in the same orientation. In these cases,
it is presumed that homology between the Alu sequences led to a mispairing of chromosome 19
chromatids during meiosis, followed by an unequal
crossover that deletes (or inserts) the intervening
sequence. In some cases, the two Alu sequences are
oriented in opposite directions, and in these cases
the recombination was likely an intrachromosomal
event. Single Alu sequences can also instigate gene
rearrangements at the LDL receptor. Ah-mediated
rearrangements of the type seen in the LDL receptor gene have been reported for more than 30 different human mutations involving more than 14
loci (for review, Hobbs et al., 1990; also see Neote
et al., 1990; Hu et al., 1991).
Transport-Defective Mutations as a Cause of
Human Disease

As discussed above, transport-defective alleles
are the most frequent class of LDL receptor mutations, accounting for over 50% of all mutations
that cause FH. I t has become increasingly clear
that mutations producing transport-defective proteins are not only a frequent cause of FH but also
of other genetic diseases (Hobbs et al., 1990; Am-

ara et al., 1992). Transport-defective mutations
causing inborn errors have recently been described
in the genes that encode five membrane proteins.
These include the P-subunit of the heterodimeric
leukocyte adhesion proteins LFA-1, Mac-I, and
p150,95 (responsible for leukocyte adhesion deficiency), sucrase-isomaltase (congenital sucraseisomaltase deficiency), the insulin receptor (several rare alleles causing leprechaunism and insulinresistant diabetes mellitus), the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
(the most common allele producing cystic fibrosis), and rhodopsin (autosomal dominant forms of
retinitis pigmentosa). A transport-defective phenotype has also been observed in mutations involving three secretory proteins that cause disease: a1-antitrypsin
(responsible
for
hereditary
emphysema), pro-a- 1 collagen (osteogenesis imperfects), and pro-a-2 collagen (osteogenesis im-

perfects).

Together with observations o n the LDL receptor, these findings suggest that a transport-defective phenotype may frequently underlie mutations
involving cell surface or secreted proteins. The
transport defect can be attributed to the ability of
the cell to detect small regions of misfolding within
a protein and thereby to interdict its movement to
the cell surface (Yamamoto et al., 1986; Gething
and Sambrook, 1992).

Targeting Signals for Receptors That Cluster in
Coated Pits

The discovery of the LDL receptor internalization defect in the FH homozygote J. D. (Brown and
Goldstein, 1976) and the subsequent demonstration that the mutant receptors in this patient failed
to cluster in clathrin-coated pits (Anderson et al.,
1977) provided the earliest evidence that cell surface receptors must cluster in clathrin-coated pits
in order to carry their ligands into cells (Goldstein
et al., 1979).
As discussed above, the 1.0. allele has a single
bp change that substitutes a cysteine for tyrosine
807, which is part of a tetrameric sequence NPVY
that constitutes the signal for clustering the LDL
receptor in coated pits. A variant of this sequence
NPxY (where x can be any amino acid) is present
in the cytoplasmic tails of four other members of
the LDL receptor gene family-LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) (Herz et al., 1988), gp330
(Heymann nephritis antigen) (Raychowdhury et
al., 1989), the VLDL receptor (Takahashi e t al.,
1992), and the chicken vitellogenin receptor
(Barber et al., 1991). O n e or more NPxY se-

quences are also present in the cytoplasmic domains of at least 13 other cell surface receptors,
including several with tyrosine kinase activity
(EGF, c-erb-Blneu, insulin, IGF-l), the P-subunits
of the integrin receptors, and the amyloid precursor protein (Chen et al., 1990). In the insulin
receptor, two NPxY sequences make a contribution to internalization (Backer et al., 1992). The
functional role of this sequence in the other proteins is unknown.
Stimulated by the studies of the J.D. allele, investigators studying other coated pit receptors have
searched for targeting signals that contain an aromatic amino acid. In the transferrin receptor and
the mannose-6-phosphate receptor, the signals for
coated pit clustering involve sequences of 4-6
amino acids that each contains at least one aromatic residue, usually a tyrosine, but lacks the
other elements of the NPxY signal (Vaux, 1992 for
review). Computer modeling (Collawn et al.,
1991) and NMR studies (Bansal and Gierasch,
1991) suggest that the common feature in the targeting sequences for all three of these receptors is
the ability to form a tight turn that orients the
aromatic residue in a fixed configuration. Presumably, the coated pit assembly proteins recognize
the aromatic residue within this tight turn and
thereby move the receptor to a coated pit.
Multiplicity of Repeats and
Multifunctionality of Receptors
The LDL receptor is a modular protein that was
assembled by exon shuffling (Siidhof et al., 1985).
In general, each of the 40-amino acid, cysteinerich repeats in the ligand binding domain as well as
each of the three growth factor repeats and the five
YWTD-containing repeats in the EGF homology
region is encoded by a separate exon.
As discussed above, analyses of naturally occurring FH mutations, as in the FH Paris-1 allele, and
of in vitro-generated mutations have shown that
different combinations of the multiple cysteinerich repeats in the ligand binding domain allow the
receptor to bind two structurally different ligands.
Binding of apoB-100 of LDL requires the integrity
of repeats 2 through 7, whereas binding of apoE of
P-VLDL is determined predominantly by repeat 5
(Russell et al., 1989).
The use of different combinations of cysteinerich repeats to bind different ligands has general
implications for explaining an important concept
in receptor biology, namely that many cell surface
receptors are multifunctional molecules that bind
structurally different ligands. Three examples are

illustrative. First, the mammalian cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor, which contains 15 cysteine-rich repeats with an average size
of 147 amino acids per repeats, binds two unrelated
families of ligands: (1) lysosomal enzymes that contain multiple mannose-6-phosphate residues; and
( 2 ) insulin-like growth factor-I1 (IGF-11) which
contains no mannose-6-phosphate in its structure
(Kornfeld, 1992). The second example involves
the Drosophila notch locus, which encodes an EGFhomologous transmembrane receptor that contains
36 cysteine-rich growth factor repeats. Mutations
that affect different repeats produce different developmental phenotypes (Kelley et al., 1987), implying multiple protein-protein interactions. One
of these interactions, found between notch and
delta, requires only 2 of the 36 repeats in the notch
gene product (Rebay et al., 1991).
The third example of a multifunctional receptor
is the LDL receptor-related protein, LRP, a 4525amino acid protein that contains 3 1 cysteine-rich
ligand binding repeats of the LDL receptor type
organized in four clusters and 22 growth factor repeats that are separated by eight YWTDcontaining repeats. LRP differs functionally from
the LDL receptor in that it does not bind LDL. It
is selective for lipoproteins that are enriched with
apoE (Brown et al., 1991). LRP is also able to bind
and internalize several nonlipoprotein ligands, including lipoprotein lipase (Beisiegel e t al., 1991;
Willnow et al., 1992), activated az-macroglobulin
(Strickland et al., 1990; Kristensen e t al., 1990),
plasminogen
activatorlinhibitor
complexes
(Willnow et al., 1992; Orth et al., 1992; Bu e t al.,
1992), and Pseudomonas exotoxin A (Kounnas et
al., 1992). If these three receptors behave like the
LDL receptor, then their multiple ligands may
bind to different combinations of repeats, and selective obliteration of certain repeats may selectively abolish binding of one ligand.
Clinical Variability in FH: Entr6e for Identifying
New Cholesterol Genes
The nature of the LDL receptor gene mutation
contributes to the clinical variability seen in patients with FH. Individuals with mutations that
impair, but do not completely abolish, receptor
function tend to have lower plasma levels of LDLcholesterol, are more responsive to therapy, and
have less aggressive coronary atherosclerosis than
do individuals whose genes produce totally defective receptors (Goldstein and Brown, 1989).
Those mutations that produce a protein that retains the ability to bind and internalize IDL (P-

LDL RECEPTOR MUTATIONS

VLDL) but not LDL tend to have lower plasma
LDL-cholesterol concentrations and less severe
clinical sequelae (Hobbs et al., 1990).
In individuals with FH, the concentration of
plasma LDL can vary remarkably even among individuals with the same mutation within the same
family. One reason is that other genes impact importantly o n the concentration of plasma LDL.
This has been shown most dramatically in a large
family, the P. family, in which one-third of the FH
heterozygotes with a documented LDL receptor
mutation have concentrations of plasma LDL below the 90th percentile, whereas the other twothirds with the same receptor mutation have the
expected elevation in plasma LDL concentration
above the 95th percentile (Hobbs et al., 1989).
Genetic analysis suggests the presence of a dominant gene whose effect is to suppress the effect of
the LDL receptor mutation. This putative suppressor gene is not linked to the LDL receptor locus
itself or to the genes for apoB-100, apoE, or nine
other candidate genes that influence lipoprotein
metabolism. Further studies with anonymous genomic probes will be required to map the chromosomal location of this LDL-lowering gene.
