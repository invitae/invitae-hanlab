Article a b s t r a c b h a l y s i s of the connexin32 gene in patients with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease shows mutations distributed throughout the molecule, with all domains affected except the fourth transmembrane domain and
the distal carboxy terminus. Sequence analysis of DNA from 19 unrelated patients detected six novel mutations and
three previously reported mutations. Identification of additional mutations extends the distribution of connexin32 mutations in X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and shows that specific mutations recur in additional families.

X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a
peripheral neuropathy characterized by progressive distal extremity weakness, atrophy, sensory
loss, and areflexia. Males are more severely affected than females, with usual onset of symptoms
in adolescence. Nerve conduction velocities range
between 25 a n d 40 mlsec i n affected males,
whereas heterozygous females have values between
25 and 50 d s e c . Linkage studies and recombination analysis'-'j mapped the CMTX gene to the proximal long arm of the X chromosome at Xq13.1. Connexin32 (Cx32) was also mapped within this region
of the X ~ h r o m o s o m esuggesting
,~~~
it as a candidate
gene for CMTX. Northern blot analysis demonstrated Cx32 expression i n normal peripheral
nerve, and we9 identified mutations associated with
CMTX by direct sequencing of the coding region of

the Cx32 gene.
Cx32 is a 32-kD gap junction protein originally
isolated from liver.1Â°-12It is expressed in kidney, intestine, lung, spleen, stomach, testes, and brain as
well as in peripheral n e r ~ e . Gap
~ J ~junctions are intercellular channels made of two hemichannels,
each composed of connexin molecules arranged
around a central pore.I4J5The pore is thought to be
lined by polar residues from the third transmembrane domainl'j and allows passage of ions and
small molecules of up to 1,000 daltons. The channel
diameter is estimated to be 1.2 nm, preventing the
passage of larger molecules such as proteins and
nucleic acids.
Others have confirmed our finding of Cx32 mutations in CMTX familie~.'~-~l
Here, we describe additional mutations in Cx32. Our results show that

mutations affect most regions of the molecule, increasing the total number of identified mutations
to 33 in 39 families (figure).
Methods. Blood samples were obtained from family
members under a protocol of informed consent. Genomic
DNA was extracted from venous blood by established
methods2
Two fragments that together encompass the entire
Cx32 gene coding region, one of 306 and one of 666 base
pairs, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) using primers and conditions previously publ i ~ h e d These
.~
fragments were purified with t h e
Geneclean DNA purification kit (BIO 101). The PCR
fragments were directly analyzed by automated cycle sequencing with fluorescent tagged terminators on an Applied Biosystems, Inc. sequencer, using the same primers
as for amplification plus two additional internal primers
that were also previously p ~ b l i s h e dPatient
.~
sequences
were compared with control sequences to reveal mutations within the coding region of the Cx32 gene.
1864 NEUROLOGY 45 October 1996

For those mutations that result in changes in restriction sites, as determined by computer analysis of the new
sequence, genotypes of individuals were determined by
restriction endonuclease digestion of the appropriate
PCR fragment. Each reaction was analyzed by electrophoresis in 1 to 5% agarose gels, with ethidium bromide for visualization.

Results. Direct sequencing of the Cx32 gene in
CMTX patients revealed five novel missense mutations and one novel frameshift mutation (table).
These mutations included a valinejleucine substitution at codon 13 in the amino terminal intracellular domain i n p a t i e n t sample PQ; a n isoleucinejasparagine substitution at codon 30 in the
middle of the first transmembrane domain in family 266; a tyrosinejcysteine substitution at codon
65 in the first extracellular loop adjacent to the
third highly conserved cysteine residue in family
1850; a valinejmethionine substitution at codon

tryptophan-+arginine substitution at codon 133 in
the third transmembrane domain in family 261.22
The identified frameshift mutation predicts a truncated 194-amino acid protein with the last 58
amino acids, starting at codon 137, altered from
wild type in the VA family.
Three recurrent mutations were also identified
during sequencing. Two families (nos. 264 and
265) showed a previously reported nonsense mutation predicting truncation of t h e protein a t
amino acid 22O.l7 One family (no. 69) showed a
codon 139 valinejmethionine missense mutation,
also in the third transmembrane domain.y Another family (no. 269) showed recurrence of the
codon 156 leucine-arginine missense mutation located in the second extracellular loopg None of the
reported families with the same mutation a r e
known to be related. In most cases, families with
the same mutation are from different geographic
regions. For example, family 69 is from New York,
and the other two families with the identical mutation are from South Dakota and Michigan, with no
known New York connection.
Nine families analyzed had no mutation within
the coding region of Cx32. Seven of these represent
sporadic cases, one has affected members in only
two generations, and another is a large, multigenerational kindred previously reported t o be Xlinked.23Affected individuals in all these families
had features clinically consistent with CMTX.
For seven of the nine mutations, changes in restriction endonuclease sites allowed the analysis of
mutation segregation. These seven changes include
the gain of a Nla 111 site in family 69, the gain of a
Dde I site in families 264 and 265, the loss of a Mbo
I1 site in family 266, the gain of an Hha I site in
family 269, the loss of a BbrPI site in family 272,
the gain of a Mae I11 site in family 1850, and the
gain of a Dra I11 site in family VA. Restriction-site
changes allowed these mutations to be analyzed in
unrelated normal individuals to rule out the possi-

bility that they represent naturally occurring polymorphisms, to be traced through the remainder of
the families, and to be used to diagnose carrier status in females. In each case, the putative mutations were not found in a screening of 50 unrelated,
normal females.

Discussion. Cx32 mutations are directly associated with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
The mechanism by which these mutations cause
the phenotype remains unknown, but the presence
of mutations in almost all regions of the molecule
indicates that most of the molecule is important to
the function of Cx32 in Schwann cells. Cx32 localizes by immunohistochemistry to the nodes of Ranvier and the Schmidt-Lantermann incisures in peripheral n e r ~ eOther
.~
forms of Charcot-MarieTooth disease, types 1A and l B , are associated
with mutations in myelin genes, peripheral myelin
protein 22 kD (PMP-22) in type 1A and protein
zero (PO) in type lB.24These proteins are in compact myelin, whereas Cx32 is in noncompact
myelin. However, the similarities of the resulting
disease phenotypes indicate t h a t each of these
Schwann cell proteins has an important function in
peripheral nerve.
The variety of mutations found suggests that
virtually all regions of Cx32 are important in its
function. Families linked to the region of the X
chromosome where Cx32 is located but without
mutations in the open reading frame suggest that
mutations in noncoding regions of the gene, such as
the promoter and splice sites, may be responsible
for causing the d i s e a ~ e .These
~ , ~ ~regions need to be
further studied.
Gap junctions allow the passage of ions and
small molecules as well as conduction of electrical
currents. The loss of junctional conductance in the
paired oocyte expression system with three of the
originally described mutant Cx32 molecules suggests that these mutations cause a loss of Cx32
function.25Analysis of these mutants revealed a

dominant negative effect for one mutation when coexpressed with connexin 26 but not connexin 40.
Depending on the mutation, the mechanism of disease may be either a loss of product effect or a dominant negative effect, as reported in Marfanâs syndrome.26Further identification of mutations may
allow a genotype-phenotype correlation, which
could aid in defining the CMTX disease mechanism.
