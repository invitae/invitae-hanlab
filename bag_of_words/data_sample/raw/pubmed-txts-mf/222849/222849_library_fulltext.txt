The mechanism of ascorbate action on lysyl hydroxylase (LH) was investigated using cultured dermal fibroblasts from a patient with hydroxylysine-deficient collagen disease and from appropriate control patients.
Cells from this patient had moderately impaired LH and
both parents had intermediate values. Prolyl hydroxylase (PH) was normal in these 3 cell lines and the ratio
between LH and PH proved an effective genetic discriminant among cell lines from different individuals expressing varying enzyme activity.
Ascorbate requirements for normal and mutant enzymes were defined and compared. Some specificity for
ascorbate as the principal physiological reductant was
found. Lysyl hydroxylase activity from controls was 89%
of maximum when dithiothreitol alone was omitted
w-hereas only 8% of activity was present when L-ascorbate alone was omitted. Control activity was fully reconstituted when isoascorbate was substituted for L-ascorbate, but activity was absent when dehydroascorbate
w-as used.
Enzyme activity in cultured cells from this patient and
a control was enhanced proportionately by increasing
ascorbate concentration. At concentrations of 0.5 mM
and above, saturation was evident and mutant enzyme
activity was 17% of control. The apparent Kin of both
enzymes for ascorbate was identical (0.1 mM) while the
apparent V max of mutant enzyme was reduced to 25%
of control. Ascorbate did not alter thermostability of
either mutant or control enzyme, and increasing ascorbate concentration did not overcome competitive inhibition by Cu2+ of Fe 2 + -dependent enzyme activity.
These studies demonstrated that this patient with type
VI, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome had reduced skin collagen
hydroxylysine caused by impaired lysyl hydroxylase,
that this mutation was transmitted as an autosomal
recessive trait and that the mutant enzyme had a reduced
capacity for ascorbate. Ascorbate augmented lysyl hydroxylase activity by dir.ect electron donation at a ferrous ion-containing site of this enzyme complex.

Collagen is the principal structural element of connective
tissue providing the necessary tensile strength to maintain
organizational integrity of various organ systems [1,2]. The
functional capacity of this extracellular fibrous protein is determined largely by sequential posttranslational modifications directed toward specific amino acid residues [3-5]. Hydroxylation
of predetermined lysyl and prolyl residues in peptide linkage is
catalyzed by 2 distinct enzymes, lysyl hydroxylase (EC
1.14.11.4) and prolyl hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.2) [6]. Both are
characteristic of a recently discovered class of dioxygenases
which couple the stoichiometric decarboxylation of a-ketoglutarate to peptidyl hydroxylation [7]. We have previously characterized lysyl hydroxylase in crude lysates of cultured human
fibroblasts, its requirements for molecular oxygen, ferrous ion,
a-ketoglutarate, ascorbate and its genetic control in man [8].
Increased understanding of collagen biochemistry has contributed to a growing awareness of abnonnal collagen synthesis
and structure associated with certain human disease states
[9,10]. Hydroxylysine-deficient collagen disease (Ehlers-DanIos
syndrome, type VI) was the first heritable human disorder of
collagen in which a specific molecular defect was identified.
Amino acid analysis of extracted skin collagen from 2 affected
sisters revealed a hydroxylysine content which was 5% of controls [11]. Krane, Pinnell, and Erbe et al found that lysyl
hydroxylase activity in lysates of cultured fibroblasts from these
patients was reduced to between 10% and 14% of controls and
was not further augmented by supraoptimal cofactor concentrations in vitro [12]. Subsequently, Quinn and Krane demonstrated that this mutant enzyme W(l.S less stable at 37° than the
wild type and exhibited a lower affmity for ascorbate than
control enzyme when assayed in the presence of the sulfhydryl
reagent dithiothreitol and ascorbate [13].
,
Four other patients have been described with hydroxylysinedeficient skin collagen and Ehlers-DanIos syndrome [8,14-17].
One of these 4 was a patient with an autosomal recessive fonn
of Ehlers-DanIos syndrome (type VI) who had impaired lysyl
hydroxylase activity in cultured skin fibroblasts and phenotypically normal parents. Ascorbate was identified as the principal
physiological reductant in the reaction. While the patient was
not ascorbate 'deficient, in vivo administration of pharmacologic
amounts of vitamin C increased urinary hydroxylysine excretion
and improved the patient's scar formation, muscle strength,
bleeding time, and corneal size. Hydroxylysine content of skin
did not increase [8]. The data contained in the present study
characterize the biochemical interaction of ascorbate with lysyl
hydroxylase from control and this patient's cultured skin fibroblasts and relate this interaction to the previously observed in
vivo effects.

RESULTS

Preparation of Labeled Unhydroxylated Substrate
Labeled unhydroxylated collagen substrate was prepared from 15day-old chick calvaria incubated in 7.0 rnl of Dulbecco's lysine-free
minimal essential medium with 3.0 mCi ofL-[4,5- 3H] lysine (1 mCi/rnl)
or 9.6 ml of medium with 400 J.lCi of L-[3,4-3H] proline (1 mCi/ml) as
previously described by Peterkofsky and Diblasio [lB]. This preparation
was supplemented with 0.5 mM a,a' -dipyridyl, aerated with 90% air10% CO 2 and incubated for 3 hr at 37° . The calvaria were separated
from the medium, then rinsed with cold 0.11 M NaCI-0.05M Tris-HCI,
pH 7.4, containing 1 mM L-Iysine or L-proline and homogenized in 24
rnl of 0.5 N acetic acid in a Teflon-glass tissue homogenizer. The
preparation was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min and the clarified
supernatant dialyzed against 0.4 M NaCI-0.1 M Tris-HCI, pH 7.6 for 4B
hr before precipitating with 176 mg/ml of solid ammonium sulfate (30%
saturated solution) . The precipitate was dissolved in 0.2 M NaCI-0.05M
Tris-HCI, pH 7.6 and dialyzed against the same buffer. This dialyzed
solution was warmed to 37° for 1.5 hr to allow fibril formation by
unlabeled soluble collagen. Associated fibrils were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 10 min to enhance the specific activity of the
final substrate preparation. Approximately 5 rnl of L-[4,5- 3H] Iysinelabeled (2.7 X 107 dpm/rnl) or L-[3,4-3H] proline-labeled (4.7 X 106
dpm/ ml) unhydroxylated collagen substrate were obtained and stored
in aliquots at -20°C. Each experiment with the mutant and control
cell lines was performed with the same substrate preparations since
others have found different substrate preparations had different specific
activities [13,19].

Fibroblast Culture and Enzyme Preparation
Skin biopsy material was obtained by punch biopsy and grown in
monolayer cultures using Dulbecco and Vogt's modified Eagle's media
supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum and glutamine by previously
described methods [20]. Cells were seeded at 6.2-7.0 X 10' cells/ml (100
ml medium) in 690 cm 2 Belco roller bottles, grown to copfluence,
harvested 2 days postconfluence with trypsin, and pelleted. The pellet
was resuspended at a density of 2.5-3.0 X 10" cells/ml in 0.2 M NaCI-0.1
M glycine-50 J.lM DTT-20 mM Tris-HCI buffer, pH 7.5, with rapid
freezing and thawing 3 times before centrifuging at 15,000 g for 10 min
at 4°C. Supernatant was either used immediately or dialyzed for 24 hr
at 4°C against a 0.15 M NaCI-0.1 M glycine-50 J.lM DTT-20 mM TrisHCI buffer, pH 7.5, and frozen at -20°C for no more than one week.
Dialysis of subcellular preparations from human fibroblast cultures
had previously been used in this laboratory to clarify the relative
requirements of aqueous soluble cofactors involved in complex enzyme
reactions [21,22]' Activity of dialyzed enzyme was stable for 4 weeks at
-20°C: Protein content was determined by a modified method of Lowry
et al [23].

Assay of Hydroxylase Activities from Cultured Fibroblasts
Lysyl hydroxylase activity was evaluated in enriched cytosolic fractions of normal cultured human fibroblasts. In an
initial assay containing 150 ,.,.g of cytosolic protein, enz~e­
dependent release of tritium was linear with respect to t~e
over a 20 min period of incubation (Fig 1) . No increase m
activity with increasing protein concentration was seen when
a-ketoglutarate was omitted. Tritium release with 15 ,.,.1 ?f
substrate plateaued at protein concentrations above 120 ,.,.g (FIg
2). Addition of substrate, but not enzyme, during assay reproduced a linear relationship. All subsequent assays utilized 1.5
,.,.1 of substrate preparation and approximately 60 ,.,.g of cytos ohc
protein in a 20 min incubation. Control enzyme activity· was 3
to 4 times background. Background was defined as tritium
released in the absence of the cosubstrate, a-ketoglutarate,
unless otherwise stated (Fig 2) .
The specificity and genetic control of lysyl hydroxylase impairment were examined in cultured dermal fibroblasts from
the proband, his parents and control cell lines. As seen in Table
I, the mean lysyl hydroxylase activity in non dialyzed lysates of
the patient's cells was 17% of the mean activity of age-matched
controls. Activity was reduced at several different enzyme-protein concentrations (data not shown) . Mean activity in lysates
from fibroblasts of the father and mother was 66% and 39%,
respectively. The level of prolyl hydroxylase in these same
lysates was within the range of activities expressed by control
cells as was mitochondrial branched chain a-ketoacid dehydrogenase. Fibroblasts obtained from normal individuals will express variable lysyl and prolyl hydroxylase activities when
cultured under identical conditions as indicated by the standard
deviations in Table I. Quantitation of variant lysyl hydroxylase
activity by tritium-exchange assay is an arbitrary measurement,
and caution should be exercised when utilizing percent of control activity as a determinant of enzyme deficiency. Quinn and
Krane noted that the ratio of lysyl hydroxylase activity to
prolyl hydroxylase activity best reflected the relative lysyl
hydroxylase activity in a given cell lysate [13]. As shown in

Enzyme A ssay
Lysyl hydroxylase activity was determined by the tritium exchange
method of Peterkofsky and Di Blasio with minor modification [lB].
Approximately 310,000 dpm of L-[4,5-"H] Iysyl collagen substrate were
incubated with 80 J.!l of fibroblast lysate for 20 min at 30°C in a final
volume of 0.5 ml. The reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCI
adjusted to pH 7.5 at 30°C, 0.5 mM a-ketoglutarate, 0.0 to 1.0 mM Lascorbate, 0.1 mg catalase, 0.05 mM Fe(NH,hSO" 0.75 mg bovine serum
albumin (BSA) and 0.1 roM DTT. The assay was stopped by the
addition of 50 J.l1 of 50% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Fifteen J.l1 of BSA
(25 mg/ ml) were added to the assay tubes with mixing and kept on ice
15 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 g for 5 min, the combined
supernatants from the original centrifugation and one wash with 5%
TCA were applied to 2.5 cm columns of AG Dowex 50W-XB. Eluant
was collected in scintillation vials and mixed with 8 rnl of Aquasol II for
counting in a Nuclear Chicago Mark I liquid scintillation counter with
33% efficiency. Prolyl hydroxylase activity was measured by the same
procedure except that the reaction mixture contained 47,000 dpm of L[3,4_3H] prolyl collagen substrate and 0.1 mM a-ketoglutarate. In both
assays enzyme activity was defined as tritium released in the presence
as compared to the absence of a-ketoglutarate unless otherwise stated.
In experiments testing the effect of cupric ion on enzyme activity,
albumin, catalase and dithiothreitol were omitted from the incubation
mixture. Kinetic analysis was performed in a complete assay system
lacking dithiothreitol. Lineweaver-Burke plots were generated by the
method of least squares [24]. Statistical analysis was conducted with

Cofactor Requirements of Control and Mutant Enzyme
Cofactor requirements for dialyzed lysyl hydroxylase were
assessed. Subcellular enzyme preparations were exhaustively
dialyzed to assure removal of aqueous-soluble cofactors before
reconstitution and assay. As seen in Fig 3, when dithiothreitol
alone was omitted from the reaction, 89% of activity remained,
indicating that this reducing agent was not a principal reductant
for the reaction. When catalase, bovine serum albumin, or Fe2 +
were omitted separately, lysyl hydroxylase activity was 91%,
73%, and 63% of maximum activity, respectively. When Lascorbate was omitted only 4% of complete activity remained.
When a-ketoglutarate alone was omitted, essentially no activity
above that of a minus enzyme blank was present.
The reducing properties and steric requirements of L-ascorbate action on dialyzed enzyme were investigated with analogs
of L -ascorbate and unconjugated pteridine (Table II). Control
activity was measured in the complete assay system without
dithiothreitol but containing either 1 mM or 10 mM L-ascorbate.
Isoascorbate, the D-arabinose isomer of L-ascorbate which
exhibits a similar standard redox potential [25], reconstituted

243

103% and 94% of control activity observed with 1 roM and 10
mM ascorbate, respectively. Lysyl hydroxylase activity was
stimulated to a lesser degree by 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6, 7-dim ethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropt eridine, a naturally occurring reducing agent structurally dissimilar from ascor bate. Lysyl h ydroxylation in the presence of 1 mM and 10 mM tetrahydropteridine
was 82% and 91% of control, respectively. Addition of equal
concentrations of ascorbate and tetrahydropteridine were not
additive . Activity in assays containing less than saturating levels
of L-ascorbate and either 0.02 mM or 0.1 mM tetrahydropteridine was reduced when compared to assays with ascorbate but
lacking tetrahydropteridine (data not shown). Incubation of
substrate, cofactors without enzyme and 0.01-10 mM t etrahydropteridine revealed no evidence of nonspecific tritium release
by pteridine. In marked contrast dehydroascorbate, the oxidation product of L-ascorbate, produced minimal activity at a
concentration of either 1 mM or 10 mM. These data indicated
that the reducing properties of ascorbate are required for human lysyl h ydroxylase activity and that tetrahydropteridine
but not dithiothreitol can partially substitute as a reducing
agent.

Ascorbate Interaction with Lysyl Hydroxylase
Certain divalent cations interfere with lysyl and prolyl hydroxylase activities by competing with ferrous ion for binding
at the active site [26,27]. This enzyme-ferrous ion locus could
also serve as a site of ascorbate interaction with the active
enzyme complex. Inhibition of human lysyl hydroxylase with
Cu 2 + defined Cu 2 + as a site-specific probe and enabled further
exploration of ascorbate interaction with the enzyme complex.
Our kinetic analysis defined competitive inhibition of iron-stimulated enzyme activity by cupric ion (Fig 4) . An increase in
ferrous ion concentration increased lysyl hydroxylase activity
in the presence of fixed inhibitor concentration. Double reciprocal plots converged at a common ordinate intercept, indicating an identical apparent maximal velocity. A replot of slopes
of the reciprocal plots against inhibitor concentration was linear, indicating that copper inhibition was unique to iron-specific
binding sites (data not shown). The apparent K; determined by
extrapolation was 7 f.l.M. As indicated in Fig 4, 32 f.l.M Cu 2 +
inhibited enzyme activity with identical ordinate but different
abscissal intercepts from 64 f.l.M Cu 2+

mutant enzyme in the presence of ascorbate resulted in app~­
ent greater activity than its absence, the increase in spec c
activity was not statistically significant (p > 0.1). These da~
suggested that the mechanism of ascorbate action was no
primarily to promote thermostability of the enzyme compl~x.
L-ascorbate was not effective in increasing the relative actiVIty
of mutant enzyme when exposed to elevated temperatures for
increasing periods of time (data not shown).
The effects of increasing L-ascorbate concentration on control and mutant lysyl hydroxylase are shown in Fig 6. Data
represent the average of 3 separate experiments with the 2 cell
lines. Control enzyme activity rose rapidly as ascorbate was
increased from 0.01 mM to an optimum concentration of 0.5
mM. Further increase to 1.0 mM did not further augment enzyme
activity. Enzyme activity from the patient's cells also was

FIG 7. Double reciprocal plots of the velocity of lysyl hydroxylase

activity versus ascorbate concentration. Replot of data depicted in Fig
6 obtained over an ascorbate range from 0.01 mM to 1.0 mM . Each point
represents the mean value of at least 3 determinations obtained in 3
separate experiments with each cell line.

Thus, although this mutant enzyme complex had a reduced
capacity for ascorbate as compared to control, both the control
and mutant enzymes had a normal affinity for L-ascorbate.
This result was quite different from the only other previously
investigated mutant enzyme which had a decreased apparent
Kill for ascorbate (13].

Our recent description of a patient with mild Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome (type VI) whose clinical status improved following
administration of pharmacologic amounts of vitamin C suggested that further study of ascorbate-enzyme interaction in his
and control cells might clarify both the basic mechanisms of
ascorbate action on collagen lysyl hydroxylase and the pathological mechanisms producing an altered phenotype [8]. Data
from parental and the proband's cultured cells confIrmed for
the first time that deficiency of lysyl hydroxylase activity conformed to an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. SignifIcant diminution of enzyme activity was observed in cytosolic
fractions from cultured fIbroblasts of the patient, while preparations from both parents displayed intermediate activity. This
genetic aberration was specifIc, since prolyl hydroxylase activities from all 3 cell lines were within the range of controls.
The correlation between phenotypic expression and enzyme
activity in cultured fIbroblasts suggested that the biochemical
mechanisms producing an observed clinical response to large
amounts of ascorbate might also be studied in vitro. After
exhaustive dialysis our cytosolic preparation of lysyl hydroxylase required the reducing properties of ascorbate for enzyme
activity. Another naturally occurring reducing agent tetrahydropteridine could partially reconstitute activity but dithiothreitol and dehydroascorbate could not. How then might ascorbate
act? At least 5 possible interactions were considered. First,
ascorbate might promote conversion of an inactive proenzyme
form or association of inactive subunits producing an active
enzyme complex. Second, this reductant might exert a protective effect on the enzyme complex to reduce its biological or
physical rate of degradation. A third possible mechanism would
directly involve its reducing properties in promoting the generation or maintenance of non-specifIc enzymic sulfhydryl
groups. Fourthly, L-ascorbate might act indirectly to maintain
free iron it its reduced state during regeneration of the hydroxylating system independently of a more extensive oxidationreduction system [28]. Finally, L-ascorbate might donate electrons directly to the enzyme, possibly causing an alteration in
the conformation of the enzyme and subsequently augmentation of lysyl hydroxylation.
With respect to the fIrst hypothesis, the evidence from others
mitigates its probability. There is no present evidence for
proenzyme conversion or subunit association requiring L-ascorbate for lysyl hydroxylase. Studies by Miller indicated that
lysyl hydroxylase activity in L-929 fIbroblasts was not dependent upon ascorbate activation of an inactive precursor form
[29]. Investigation by Kuttan, Cardinale and Udenfriend of
prolyl hydroxylase activation in vitro suggested that conversion
of smaller, cross-reacting protein to a larger, active complex
was unlikely, and that activation by ascorbate was a direct
cofactor actipn, causing release of active enzyme bound to
underhydroxylated collagen in an inactive complex [30). To test
further this hypothesis, investigators will need a purifIed lysyl
hydl'Oxylase and its monospecifIc antibody.
Perhaps ascorbate prolonged the biological half life of the
enzyme complex by protecting it against degradation? Reduced
activity expressed in mutant celllysates might reflect enzyme
present in subnormal amounts as a result of enhanced rates of
degradation. The question was approached indirectly by measuring the effects of large amounts of ascorbate on the thermostability of this enzyme. Ascorbate did not change the thermal inactivation curves for control or mutant lysyl hydroxylase.
Evidently, these pharmacological amounts of ascorbate were
not protecting enzyme against thermal degradation as described
for thiamine pyrophosphate on branched chain a -ketoacid dehydrogenase or pyridoxal phosphate on cystathionine synthase
[31-34].
Thus, 3 possibilities for ascorbate interaction remained: a
direct effect by maintaining specifIc -SH groups of the apoenzyme, an indirect effect by maintaining free ferrous ion and the

246 .

direct electron donation to the enzyme complex. The sulfhydryl
nature of lysyl and prolyl hydroxylase was evidenced by the
inhibition of lysyl hydroxylase activity by p-chloromecurobenzoate (PCMB), a reagent exhibiting high affinity for sulfhydryl
groups, and the reversal of this inhibition by dithiothreitol
[35]. Our data clearly demonstrated that the requirement for
ascorbate was not satisfied by substitution with dithiothreitol,
indicating that ascorbate did not act simply to maintain active
-SH groups and must therefore function in a capacity different
than dithiothreitol.
It was possible that ascorbate functioned primarily to maintain free iron in the active ferrous form. Partial but not total
loss of activity upon removal of ferrous ion indicated that Lascorbate could act without added ferrous ion. However, dialyzed lysyl hydroxylase might retain sufficient iron to allow
partial activity without addition of free ferrous ion. Maintenance of free ferrous ion in its reduced form should be more
effectively performed by a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol
with a greater electron donation potential. Our data showed
that this was clearly not the case, since dithiothreitol failed to
substitute for L-ascorbate. The reaction was totally dependent
upon added ascorbate, even in the presence of freshly made
Fe 2 + solution.
Certain divalent metal ions which exhibit a high affinity for
-SH groups reduced lysyl and prolyl hydroxylase activities by
competing with Fe 2 + for binding at the active site
[26,27,36,37]. Our kinetic data indicated that cupric ion inhibition of human lysyl hydroxylase was competitive and was
overcome by increasing ferrous ion concentration. The apparent
Ki for copper ion was equal to the apparent Km of the enzyme
for ferrous ion. The linear replot confirmed that copper
uniquely competed for iron-specific binding sites. Although the
exact nature of the ascorbate active site is unknown, direct
electron donation through bound ferrous ion is one mechanistic
possibility for ascorbate action that is consistent with this data.
However, kinetic analysis of this complex multicomponent association could not be further interpreted in the absence of a
purified enzyme preparation.
Direct electron donation by ascorbate to the enzymic complex
at its ferrous ion binding site is supported by several observations from our studies. We found that activity reconstitution in
dialyzed cell-free lysates achieved with L -ascorbate could be
duplicated with D-isoascorbate, a stereoisomer with a similar
electro~-donating potential [25]. Dehydroascorbate, the oxidized form of ascorbate, could not satisfy the ascorbate requirement without added reductant. The failure of dehydroascorbate
to stimulate enzyme activity indicated that ascorbate was not
regenerated from dehydroascorbate and that the 2 compounds
did not function in a coupled oxidation-reduction system as
cyclic electron carriers. The failure of the oxidized but sterically
similar cofactor to augment activity also suggested that ascorbate did not function as an inert ligand or an energy source
conferring more effective conformational changes or stability to
the holoenzyme complex. The nature of interaction of ascorbate
with control and mutant lysyl hydroxylase from our patient
was similar. Assay of mutant enzyme activity from cultured
cells of our patient revealed a reduced capacity (smaller apparent V max ) for lysyl hydroxylation when compared with control
enzyme, but both systems displayed an equal affinity (identical
apparent Km) for ascorbate. We conclude from the above findings that the observed clinical responses to pharmacological
amounts of ascorbate reflected this cofactor's action as electron
donor at a ferrous ion-containing site of this enzyme complex.
