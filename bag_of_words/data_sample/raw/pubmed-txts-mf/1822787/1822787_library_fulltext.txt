Abstract -Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type I (HMSN I) or Charcot-MarieTooth disease type I (CMT I) is an autosomal dominant disorder of the peripheral nervous
system characteriled by progressive weakness and atrophy of distal limb muscles. In the
majority of! I MSN I families. linkage studies locali1ed the gene (C:\1T I a) to the pcricentromeric
region of chromosome 17. We have detected with probe pVAW ..09R3 (D17S122) localized in
17p 11.2 a duplication. co-segregating with the disease in 12 H MSN I families. In these families
the duplication was present in all 12X patients but absent in the 8.. unafli:cted and 44 married-in
individuals (lod score of 5X.44 at zero recombination). Further. on one H :'v1SN I familv the
disease newly appeared simultaneously with a c/c nm·o duplication originating from an un~qual
crossing-over event at meiosis. Since dillcrent allelic combinations were found segregating with
the duplication in dilli:rent families linkage disequilibrium was not a significant factor. These
findings led us to propose that the duplication in 17p 11.2 itself is the disease causing mutation in
all the II MSN I families analyzed.

The hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies
(HMSN) arc a heterogeneous group of peripheral neuropathies becoming clinically apparent in late childhood or early adolescence [ 1).
In general, the disease is characterized by slowly
progressive weakness and atrophy of the distal
limb muscles. The disease prevalence has been
estimated from population-based series of children aged 2-15 yr in south-west Sweden as 191
100,000 [2] and of all cases in northern Spain as
28.2/100.000 (3]. The most common subtype is

HMSN type I or Charcot -Marie-Tooth disease
type I (CMT I). Patients show pes cavus,
depressed or absent deep tendon reflexes. markedly reduced nerve conduction velocities (NCV)
and a segmental pattern of extensive de- and
remyclination with onion bulb formation in sural
nerve biopsy. The clinical severity varies
considerably with some patients showing no
symptoms while others have severe foot-drop
and foot deformities at an older age. Asymptomatic patients can be identified by nerve
conduction examination. Although a few
sporadic and recessive cases have been reported
most HMSN I patients inherited the disease in an
autosomal dominant manner (4).
Linkage studies have provided evidence for
genetic heterogeneity in autosomal dominant
HMSN I. In some families linkage was observed
with the Duffy blood group on chromosome I [57]. In one of these families conclusive evidence
was obtained for a gene (CMT I b) located in
lq22-q23 [S]. In the majority of the families
linkage was dctcccd with chromosome 17 DNA
markers (6.7.912]. The chromosome 17 gene

Twelve families were included in the linkage
analysis based on the following selection criteria:
patients recorded in at least three successive
generations. clinical features consistent with
HMSN I and at least one patient with NCV
measurement. Linkage with chromosome 17
DNA markers was not a criterion for inclusion in
the analysis. The characteristics of the selected
families arc summarized in Table I. Family CMT

been described previously [().14]. In families

Informed consent was obtained from each participant.
Genomic DNA was extracted from lymphocytes and digested with the restriction enzyme
Mspl according to the manufacturer's conditions,
separated by agarosc gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with
[cr-'~P]dCTP labelled probe pVAW409R3a, a

disease with a de no\'0 duplication and the lack of
significant allelic association led us to conclude
that with a high likelihood the duplication is the
actual disease causing mutation in all of these
HMSN I families. Further. our results show that

in most. if not all. of the HMS:\ I families the
duplication is the result of an unequal crossingover event at meiosis. At present. it is not dear
yet whether the duplication directly interrupts a
gene with a primary function in the peripheral
nervous system or merely creates a third copy of
the same gene resulting in a gene dosage effect.
Our results seem to be in disagreement with
published data indicating recombination between CMT Ia and probe pVAW409R3 [15].
This inconsistency can be explained by the
observation that the duplication if not
rt.'Cognited. may obscure linkage data. For
example. in patients heterozygous for the Mspl
polymorphism. one of the duplicated alleles may
be classified incorrectly as originating from the
healthy parent. Possibly. the reported rccom-

Charcot Marie-Tooth Type Ia

binants are the result of such misclassifications.
However, we cannot yet exclude that in some
chromosome 17 linked HMSN I families other
genetic defects than a duplication may be
present.
The finding of a fully disease-associated
duplication in HMSN I patients has important
implications for the future localization. isolation
and identification of the CMT Ia gene. Indeed, in
other diseases such as Duchenne muscular
dystrophy and neurofibromatosis, chromosomal
alterations have proven to be extremely helpful
serving as markpoints for the disease gene. At
present the exact size of the duplication in
HMSN I patients is not known. No junction
fragments
were observed with
probes
pVAW409R3 and pVAW409RI on standard
Southern blots so that further studies are
focusing on defining the size of the duplication
using pulsed field gel electrophoresis and cytogenetic analysis.
Our observation has immediate implications
for the DNA diagnosis of HMSN I patients since
the duplication can be detected relatively easily,
circumventing the need for linkage studies in the
patient's family. Previously, DNA diagnosis was
restricted to a few large and informative families
since HMSN I is genetically heterogeneous with
at least two different chromosomal loci involved.
In addition, screening for the duplication may
contribute to the differential diagnosis in H M SN.
Further, it will be interesting to review the clinical
and histological characteristics of duplication
positive HMSN I patients to see whether they
differ phenotypically from other HMSN I patients.
