Summary
Autosomal dominant amyloidosis of the Indiana/Swiss type is a late-onset disorder characterized by carpal
tunnel syndrome, progressive peripheral neuropathy, vitreous deposits, and cardiomyopathy. This disorder
was originally described in a large Indiana family of Swiss descent and is also known as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) type II. In the Indiana family, the genetic basis of the disease is a variant of
plasma prealbumin (transthyretin), which has a serine-for-isoleucine substitution at amino acid 84 of the
127-residue prealbumin molecule. We predicted that the corresponding mutation in the prealbumin gene
consisted of a T-to-G change in codon 84 (which created an AlMI recognition site) and then demonstrated
the extra Alul site in the DNA of patients by Southern blot analysis with a genomic prealbumin probe.
This verifies the protein findings at the DNA level and provides a direct, reliable DNA test for the Ser-84
prealbumin gene associated with Indiana/Swiss hereditary amyloidosis.
Introduction

All amyloidosis syndromes are characterized by the
extracellular deposition of fibrillar, proteinaceous
material called amyloid (Cohen and Connors 1987).
As these deposits accumulate they interfere with the
functioning of surrounding tissues, resulting in illness. Many clinically distinct forms of autosomal
dominant systemic amyloidosis have been reported
throughout the world, with all sharing adult onset as
a common feature (Andrade et al. 1970). Peripheral
neuropathy is also a finding in most of the hereditary
forms, which accounts for the disease's alternate
name, "familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy" (FAP).
The most widespread form, FAP I, has been reported
in families of Portuguese, Swedish, Japanese, Greek,
and English descent (Andrade 1952; Araki et al.
1968; Andersson 1970; Benson and Cohen 1977;
Kincaid et al. 1984; Saraiva et al. 1986). Other FAP
kindreds with somewhat different syndromes have

been identified in a number of regions, including
Iowa, Maryland, Illinois, France, Denmark, Israel,
Finland, and the Appalachian U.S. (Frederiksen et al.
1962; Mahloudji et al. 1969; Van Allen et al. 1969;
Meretoja 1973; Julien et al. 1983; Gafni et al. 1985;
Benson et al. 1987; Wallace et al. 1988).
The subject of the present study is an Indiana family of Swiss descent with arn amyloidosis syndrome
that has been labeled FAP II. In this family, clinical
findings (beginning between the ages of 30 and 50
years) include carpal tunnel syndrome, peripheral
neuropathy, vitreous opacities, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and cardiomyopathy (Rukavina et al.
1956). Most patients die 10-20 years after disease
onset, owing to heart failure or associated complications.

Recently, several single-amino-acid variants of prealbumin (a plasma transport protein produced in
liver and choroid plexus) have been identified as the
major amyloid subunit proteins in patients with autosomal dominant amyloidosis (see table 1). Prealbumin circulates as a tetramer composed of four identical subunits, each a beta-structured molecule
containing 127 amino acids (Blake et al. 1978). The
tetramer's two known functions are the binding and

transport of thyroxine and retinol binding protein
(RBP) (Robbins et al. 1978). The human prealbumin
gene encodes the 127-residue subunit and has a
unique locus on the long arm of chromosome 18
(Wallace et al. 1985; Sparkes et al. 1987). The
finding of prealbumin variants in families with hereditary amyloidosis has led to the hypothesis that the
disease is caused by the gradual destruction of normal tissue by amyloid formed from the variant prealbumin molecules. Thus, the prealbumin gene is considered to be the hereditary amyloidosis gene in these
kindreds, with the disease genes differing from normal only by the mutations that encode the amino acid
substitutions (Shimada et al. 1986).
Four DNA mutations deduced from identified protein substitutions have been verified by Southern blot
analysis, by virtue of the fact that these mutations
create specific restriction-enzyme sites (Sasaki et al.
1984; Wallace et al. 1986, 1988; Jacobson et al.
1987). Since hereditary amyloidosis has adult onset,
direct DNA tests are of great importance in providing preclinical detection of gene carriers.
The prealbumin variant (Ser-84) in the Indiana
family contains a serine at position 84 in place of the
normal isoleucine (Dwulet and Benson 1986). We
report both development of a DNA test for the Ser84 mutation and application of this test in the Indiana family.
Material and Methods

High-molecular-weight genomic DNA was extracted from venous blood leukocytes by the method
of Madisen et al. (1987). For two affected members
of the Indiana family who died before this study,
DNA was extracted from frozen tissues (liver and
spleen) according to a method described by Kunkel et
al. (1977).

Southern blot analyses were performed as follows:
Ten-microgram genomic DNA samples were digested to completion with AluI (Bethesda Research
Laboratories) and subjected to horizontal electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel. The DNA was denatured and transferred to nitrocellulose (Southern
1975). After transfer the nitrocellulose filter was
baked and prehybridized for 4 h at 65 C in the following solution: 6 x SSC (0.9 M NaCI and 0.09 M
Na citrate, pH 7.0), 2% SDS, 1 x Denhardt's solution (0.02% ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone,
0.02% BSA fraction V), and 100 ,g sheared salmonsperm DNA/ml. A genomic probe was isolated from
a 4.7-kb/HindIII prealbumin gene insert in lambda
Ch21A by cleaving the insert with SphI. This gave a
775-bp SphIIHindIII fragment which includes the 3'
end of exon 3 and part of intron 3. The 775-bp prealbumin genomic probe fragment (Wallace et al. 1987)
was radiolabeled by the random-primer method
(Feinberg and Vogelstein 1983) and the probe (105
cpm/ng) was hybridized to filters for 48 h at 65 C in
fresh prehybridization solution (probe concentration
20 ng/ml). The filter was washed and autoradiographed, with the final wash (65 C) containing 0.2 x
SSC and 1% SDS.
Results
On the basis of the prealbumin gene sequence

(Sasaki et al. 1985), the DNA mutation corresponding to the Ser-84 protein substitution was predicted to be a T-to-G change in codon 84 (fig. 1). This
mutation creates an AluI recognition site, shown
underlined in figure 1, and therefore presents a
method for direct detection of the Ser-84 mutation
from patient DNA by Southern blot analysis.

gene and the region involved in the mutation. Codon

fragment (fig. 2) which was expected to detect an
880-bp fragment from the normal prealbumin gene
and a 790-bp fragment from the variant Ser-84 gene
was chosen as probe. Southern analysis with the
genomic probe successfully identified the additional
AluI site and thus the mutation. Lanes 1, 2, and 5-7

amyloidosis patients and show both the normal (880bp) and variant (790-bp) fragments. Lanes 3,4, and 8
contain DNA from nonaffected individuals and show
only the normal fragment, as expected. The results
also show that the patients are heterozygous for the
Ser-84 mutation, a finding that is consistent with an
autosomal dominant disease.
A total of 50 Indiana family members were tested
for the Ser-84 gene. All nine clinically affected individuals in the study showed the Ser-84 gene while
eight spouses (negative controls) showed only the
normal pattern. Thirteen of 24 at-risk individuals
under the age of 40 years (all of whom were asymptomatic) had positive Ser-84 DNA tests. Nine additional at-risk members over age 40 years had normal
DNA tests. All Ser-84 gene carriers were heterozygous for the mutation. These DNA results agree completely with prealbumin protein analysis of a number
of family members, affected and at risk, with the Ser84 gene found only in those individuals in whom the
Ser-84 protein had been identified (Dwulet and Benson 1986).
A 1983 study of the Indiana family found that all
patients and approximately one-half of at-risk relatives had significantly low serum RBP levels, and it
was suggested that a low RBP level might be indicative of the FAP II gene (Benson and Dwulet 1983).
When DNA results were compared with RBP levels
in Indiana family members, the Ser-84 gene was
found only in those 21 individuals having decreased
RBP levels, with one exception: one showed the Ser84 gene but had a normal RBP level; however, this
person also had renal failure (serum creatinine 4.0
mg/dl), which can result in elevated RBP levels.

DNA Test for Hereditary Amyloidosis
Discussion

Since 1983 a total of five prt.albumin variants other
than Ser-84 have beej2 identified, all in association
with hereditary amyloidosis. These variants and corresponding syndromes are listed in table 1. The variant found in FAP I has a methionine in place of valine
at position 30 (Met-30) (Dwulet and Benson 1983).
The Met-30 variant is most commonly associated
with an amyloidosis syndrome that includes lowerlimb neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, and renal
failure. Two other variants have also been found in
families with similar symptoms. These are the Ile-33
variant, found in one Israeli family (Nakazato et al.
1984), and the Tyr-77 variant, which was identified
in one American/German family (Wallace et al.
1988). In addition to its identification in a large Appalachian kindred (Wallace et al. 1986; Benson et al.
1987), the Ala-60 variant has been found in several
other U.S. families with hereditary amyloidosis (unpublished data). The syndrome in the Ala-60 families
features severe cardiomyopathy with mild peripheral
and autonomic neuropathy, and it generally has very
late onset (50s or 60s or later). The Danish hereditary
amyloidosis also features severe cardiac involvement
(Frederiksen et al. 1962), and initial reports indicate
that the variant has a methionine at position 111
(Met-111) (Husby and Sletten 1986; K. Sletten, personal communication). In addition to these, a number of kindreds remain to be characterized at the
biochemical or DNA level, and some of these families
have syndromes that are unique. It is apparent that
many substitutions in the prealbumin molecule can
cause the subunit to be amyloidogenic. However, the
mechanisms behind the late onset or the specificity of
the amyloid for certain tissues are unknown. A fair
amount of clinical variation is seen between and even
among prealbumin variants, which indicates that
other factors are contributing to the expression of the
disease.
The DNA patterns in the Indiana family agree perfectly with the predicted Ser-84 gene mutation and
the prealbumin gene map. The variant 790-bp fragment results from the additional AluI site in the normal 880-bp fragment that is created by the Ser-84
mutation. This verifies the protein findings and provides a method for detection of Ser-84 gene carriers.
The Ser-84 DNA test is the fifth such test for hereditary amyloidosis genes. Of the variants described
above, the Met-30, Ile-33, Ala-60, and Tyr-77 genes
can also be directly identified by straightforward

185

Southern analysis using specific restriction enzymes,
which are listed in table 1.
However, the Tyr-77 and Ser-84 DNA tests have
the additional requirement for genomic rather than
cDNA probes. In the Ser-84 case, as is evident from
figure 2, the cDNA is unable to hybridize to the 790bp fragment (under normal conditions) because it
contains only 25 bp of exon 3 sequence. Our initial
Southern analyses using the cDNA probe showed a
reduction in the intensity of the 880-bp band in gene
carriers, as expected, but the 790-bp fragment was
never evident, possibly being masked by comigrating
prealbumin sequences. Thus, we chose to develop the
test using the genomic probe to avoid those problems
and make interpretation clear. The choice of genomic
probe was limited by the need to avoid detection of
comigrating sequences and also by the close proximity of an Alu highy repetitive DNA sequence to
exon 3.
In addition to AMuI, three other enzymes theoretically could have been used to detect the Ser-84 gene
in a Southern analysis. The T-to-G mutation creates
sites for BbvI and Fnu4HI while eliminating an SfaNI

site. However BbvI and SfaNI were considered to be
prohibitively expensive, while Fnu4HI is impractical
because it cuts several times within exon 3, with the
fragments of interest thus being too small to resolve
and detect with the standard Southern analysis procedure. Fortunately, the AluI fragments are of reasonable size and the variant fragment can be easily
separated from the normal one in a short 1.5% agarose gel.
The DNA results were used to test the 1983 hypothesis that a low serum RBP level is a marker for
the FAP II gene (Benson and Dwulet 1983). When
compared with RBP concentrations for individuals in
the Indiana family, there was almost perfect correlation between a positive Ser-84 DNA test and low
RBP level. The only exception was one amyloidosis
patient. However, we feel that this normal rather
than low RBP level is due to his renal failure, since
free RBP (not bound to prealbumin) is excreted by
functioning kidneys. Thus, the DNA results show the
direct relationship between the mutant protein and
low RBP levels.
Consistent with this finding is the preliminary evidence that the Ser-84 prealbumin has a greatly reduced affinity for RBP (Helvie et al. 1986). On the
basis of the data from the DNA tests, it appears that
a low RBP level can be considered to be an accurate
indicator of the Ser-84 (FAP II) gene, excluding con-

ditions such as renal failure which might lead to falsenegative or positive results. This plasma protein test
is, of course, only applicable to adults and not to
prenatal diagnosis.
Although as yet unknown secondary factors play
a role in modifying expression of hereditary amyloidosis, the development of DNA tests for the primary factors (the prealbumin variants) is an important step in defining the incidence and diversity of the
hereditary amyloidoses. DNA testing is also important for genetic counseling by offering a means of
carrier detection that is direct and accurate. While
carrier detection can be accomplished by protein
chemistry (using prealbumin purified from plasma),
only DNA testing is applicable to prenatal diagnosis.
The Ser-84 gene test is one of five direct DNA tests
for hereditary amyloidosis, with all five tests being
based on the presence of mutations that create restriction-enzyme recognition sites. This may not be
possible for prealbumin variants that have not yet
been characterized. Theoretically the mutation predicted for the Met-111 variant deletes a DdeI site in
exon 4, but it is possible that technical difficulties
may be encountered that render such a test impossible. In such cases, or when a mutation fails to create
or delete an enzyme site, it may be possible to develop
a DNA test using an oligonucleotide probe, as has
been done for other disorders such as beta thalassemia (Orkin et al. 1983).
It seems likely that additional prealbumin variants
will be found that are associated with hereditary
amyloidosis, and it is possible that prealbumin alleles
may also exist that are not associated with amyloid
formation. DNA testing will be valuable in categorizing new amyloidosis families, in establishing connections between families, and also as a tool for genetic
counseling.
