Rapid screening of myelin genes in CMT1 patients by SSCP analysis:
identification of new mutations and polymorphisms in the Po gene

Received: 14 May 1994 / Revised: 20 June 1994

A b s t r a c t Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 (CMT1) disease or
hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type I (HMSNI)
is an autosomal dominant peripheral neuropathy. In
most CMT1 families, the disease cosegregates with a
1.5-Mb duplication on chromosome 17pl 1.2 (CMT1A).
A few patients have been found with mutations in
the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP-22) gene located
in the CMT1A region. In other families mutations have
been identified in the major peripheral myelin protein
P0 gene localized on chromosome lq21-q23 (CMT1B).
We performed a rapid mutation screening of the PMP-22
and P0 genes in non-duplicated CMT1 patients by singlestrand conformation polymorphism analysis followed
by direct polymerase chain reaction sequencing of genomic DNA. Six new single base changes in the P0 gene
were observed: two missense mutations in, respectively,
exons 2 and 3, two nonsense mutations in exon 4, and two
silent mutations or polymorphisms in, respectively, exons
3 and 6.

Introduction
Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease or hereditary motor
and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) represents a clinically
and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders of the
peripheral nervous system (Dyck et al. 1993). C M T type
1 (CMT1) disease or H M S N type I is the most frequent
subtype characterized by progressive atrophy and paresis
of distal limb muscles. CMT1 disease is mostly inherited
as an autosomal dominant trait with an estimated prevalence between 5 and 40 per 100000 (Skre 1974; Kurtzke
1984). The major electrophysiological and neuropathological features are depressed or absent deep-tendon reflexes, pes cavus deformity, reduced median motor nerve
conduction velocities (NCV) of less than 38 m/s, and segmental de- and remyelination with onion-bulb formation
on peripheral nerve biopsy.
A major locus for autosomal dominant CMT1 disease
(designated CMT1A) was identified on chromosome
17pl 1.2 on the basis of cosegregation of CMT1 disease
with a duplication of 1.5 Mb (Lupski et al. 1991; Raeymaekers et al. 1991, 1992). The CMT1A duplication
comprises the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP-22)
gene (Patel et al. 1992; Valentijn et al. 1992a; Timmerman et al. 1992; Matsunami et al. 1992), and is present
in 6 8 % - 8 2 . 5 % of CMT1 families (Wise et al. 1993;
Nelis et al. 1992; unpublished results). The majority of the
genetically sporadic C M T I patients also have the
CMT1A duplication (Hoogendijk et al. 1992; Palau et al.
1993). A few CMT1 families have been reported with a
point mutation in the PMP-22 gene, providing further evidence that PMP-22 is involved in CMT1 pathogenesis
(Valentijn et al. 1992b; Roa et al. 1993a; Nelis et al.
1994a).
A minor autosomal dominant CMT1 locus (designated
CMT1B) has been assigned by linkage analyses to chromosome lq21-q23 (Bird et al. 1982; Lebo et al. 1991).
The CMT1B locus was shown to coincide with the gene
for the major peripheral myelin protein P0 on the basis of
cosegregation of mutations in the P0 gene with CMT1B

K u l k e n s et al. 1993; Nelis et al. 1994b). So far, all k n o w n
mutations are localized in exons 2 and 3 o f the P0 gene
and involve a single a m i n o acid change, i.e. a substitution
or deletion in the extracellular d o m a i n o f P0-

Materials and methods
Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis
The coding region of the PMP-22 gene was amplified using
primers published by Roa et al. (1993a). The coding region of the
P0 gene was amplified using six primer sets (Table 1). The standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out in a 25 btl
volume containing 100 ng genomic DNA template and 25 pmole
of each oligodeoxynucleotide primer in the presence of (ot32p)dCTP (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). They were processed through 22 cycles of 1 min at 94~ 1.5 rain at the appropriate annealing temperature (P0: Ta, Table 1) (PMP-22: 60~ for
exons 1 and 4, 58~ for exon 2, 64~ for exon 3), and 2min at
72~ Samples (5 btl) of amplified DNA were mixed with 3 btl formamide sample buffer and, alter denaturation for 2 min at 100~
subjected to electrophoresis on a 1 x HydroLink MDE (J.T. Baker,
Phillipsburg, NY) gel at 15W for 18-20 hr. Gels were vacuum
dried and autoradiographed for 4 h at 70~
We used DNA samples from patients with a PMP-22 mutation
in exon 1 (Leul6Pro; Valentijn et al. 1992b), exon 3 (Ser79Cys;
Roa et al. 1993a) and exon 4 (Thr118Met; Roa et al. 1993b), and a
P0 mutation in exon 2 (ASer34; Kulkens et al. 1993) as positive
controls in the Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis
(SSCP) analysis.

Patient selection
B l o o d s a m p l e s for D N A extraction were obtained from
C M T patients and their family m e m b e r s , either following
a "call for patients" in several European scientific j o u r n a l s
(CMT-series) or after referral for D N A diagnostic purposes (PN-series). All patients were analysed for the presence o f the C M T 1 A duplication b y Southern blot hybridization o f Mspl-digested D N A with the markers
p V A W 4 0 9 R 3 a (D 17S 122) and pEW401 (D 17S61 ) (Raeym a e k e r s et al. 1992) and pulsed field gel electrophoresis
o f FspI-digested D N A h y b r i d i z e d with p V A W 4 0 9 R 3 a
(D17S 122) ( T i m m e r m a n et al. 1992). A m o n g the non-duplicated patients, 23 were selected for mutation screening
o f candidate myelin genes, since their clinical phenotype
was c o m p a t i b l e with CMT1 disease. In 15 of these cases,
C M T 1 disease was c o n f i r m e d by e l e c t r o p h y s i o l o g i c a l examination showing reduced NCV. Seven patients were
isolated cases, however, in six o f them, neither the parents
nor the siblings were clinically evaluated, so that genetic
transmission o f the disease cannot be excluded. Twelve
cases were familial, i.e. multiple patients were present in
the p e d i g r e e and, in nine o f them, the disease was autosoreal d o m i n a n t l y inherited. In four cases, no or i n c o m p l e t e
information regarding f a m i l y history was available.

Mutation analysis

Sequence analysis
For manual sequencing, we used a biotinylated primer in the PCR
amplification and the PCR product was bound to streptavidincoated magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). After denaturation,
the single-stranded DNA was sequenced using the Sequenase kit
version 2.0 (US Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH). For automated
sequencing, we used the Prism Sequenase Terminator Double
Stranded Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
The electrophoresis and analysis were performed on a 373A DNA
Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

affected son, confirming the dominant inheritance of
the disease in family PN-35. The Tyr154stop and the
Tyrl 8 l stop mutations destroy a RsaI recognition site, allowing the detection of these mutations by restriction enzyme digestion of the exon 4 PCR fragment (data not
shown).
The different P0 mutations are depicted in Fig. 1. None
of the P0 mutations was detected in 30 unrelated control
individuals when their DNA was analysed by SSCP under
the same conditions that allowed the detection of the P0
mutations, indicating that these mutations are pathogenic
for CMT1 disease.

We subsequently analyzed the P0 gene for the presence
of mutations using SSCP and direct sequencing analysis.
On the basis of the intron-exon boundaries of the P0 gene
(Pham-Dinh et al. 1993; Nelis et al. 1994b) we designed
intronic primers for PCR amplification of each of the six
exons. The primer sequences and PCR conditions are
listed in Table 1. The primers can be used for both PCRSSCP analysis and direct PCR sequencing of genomic
DNA. In six of the 23 unrelated non-duplicated CMT 1 patients, sequence variations were detected in, respectively,
exons 2, 3, 4 and 6 of the P0 gene.

P0 mutations
In patient PN-24.1, the SSCP analysis of exon 2 of the P0
gene showed an altered mobility of the PCR fragment. Sequence analysis of exon 2 in this patient revealed a C to T
base change at position 277 (numbering according to
Hayasaka et al. 1991), resulting in an amino acid substitution of Ser to Leu at codon 78. SSCP analysis indicated
that the Ser78Leu mutation was also present in the DNA
of the affected sister of the PN-24.1 patient.
Patient CMT-47.1 produced an altered SSCP pattern of
exon 3 of the P0 gene and sequencing revealed a base
change of G to A at position 444, resulting in an amino
acid substitution of Asp by Asn at codon 134. By SSCP
analysis, the Asp134Asn mutation was shown to be present in four other available patients of family CMT-47, indicating that the mutation segregates with the disease.
An altered SSCP pattern in exon 4 of the P0 gene was
detected in patients PN-35.2 and PN-78.1. Sequencing of
exon 4 in these patients revealed a single base change at
positions 587 and 506, respectively. The mutations lead to
the replacement of the codons Tyrl81 and Tyr154 by a
stop codon. The Tyrl81stop mutation was detected in the
affected mother of patient PN-35.2 but not in the un-

An altered SSCP pattern of exon 3 and exon 6 was observed in two of the 23 unrelated CMT1 patients and subsequent sequence analysis illustrated that these patients
carried silent mutations in the P0 gene. In patient CMTR1, the exon 3 SSCP pattern resulted from a mutation of
G to A at position 320, which does not change the Val
residue at codon 92. All 11 CMT-R family members who
were available for DNA testing were analysed for the mutation by SSCP analysis. As expected, the mutation, although inherited in a Mendelian fashion, did not segregate
with the disease. The altered SSCP pattern of exon 6 in
patient CMT-70.2, resulted from a C to T mutation at position 728 and did not change the Ser at codon 228. Moreover, in this case, the mutation did not segregate with
CMT1 disease. The exon 6 polymorphism created a RsaI
recognition site allowing the detection of the polymorphism at position 728 by restriction enzyme digestion of
the PCR fragment comprising the exon 6 sequence (data
not shown).
The frequency of the P0 polymorphisms was estimated
by SSCP analysis of the respective exons in unrelated
control individuals without a CMT phenotype. The exon 3
polymorphism could not be detected in 30 control individuals indicating that it is an extremely rare polymorphism with an estimated frequency of 1.6%. The exon 6
polymorphism, however, was detected in four out of 60
control individuals, resulting in an overall allele frequency of 4.1%.

Discussion
We screened genomic DNA of 23 unrelated non-duplicated CMT1 patients for mutations in the coding regions
of the PMP-22 and P0 genes. No alteration in the SSCP
pattern of the four exons of PMP-22 were observed in any
of the patients. Although the SSCP results suggest that
mutations in the PMP-22 gene in these patients are highly
unlikely, we cannot exclude that mutations may be present
that are not visible under the conditions used (Nelis et al.
1994a). Altered SSCP patterns of the P0 gene were detected in six patients and direct PCR sequencing identified
six new single base changes: two missense mutations in,

respectively, exons 2 and 3, two nonsense mutations in
exon 4 and two silent mutations or polymorphisms in, respectively, exons 3 and 6. An overview of these P0 mutations and polymorphisms is given in Table 2 and the location of the P0 mutations is depicted in Fig. 1. All four mutations involve amino acids that are conserved in P0 among
such different species as human (Hayasaka et al. 1991),
bovine (Sakamoto et al. 1987), rat (Lemke and Axel
1985) and mouse (You et al. 1991). The mutations were
found in familial CMTI patients of whom two had proven
autosomal dominant CMTI disease (CMT-47 and PN-35).
In the latter two CMTI cases, the mutation segregated
with the disease in the family. The two polymorphisms in
exons 3 and 6, respectively, were found in autosomal
dominant CMTI patients (CMT-R and CMT-70) but did
not segregate with the disease in the family. The exon 6
polymorphism was also detected in unrelated control individuals with no CMT1 phenotype; an overall allele frequency of 4.1% was calculated.
The gene for the major peripheral myelin protein P0,
localized in the l q21.3-q23 region in close proximity to
the FcyRII gene (Pham-Dinh et al. 1993), was identified
as the CMT1B gene on the basis of the cosegregation of
mutations with CMT1B disease (Hayasaka et al. 1993a, b,
c; Himoro et al. 1993; Kulkens et al. 1993; Nelis et al.
1994b). P0 is the most abundant protein in peripheral
myelin and its expression is restricted to myelinating
Schwann cells (Lemke and Axel 1985; Greenfield et al.
1973; Filbin et al. 1993). P0 is an integral membrane glycoprotein of 28 kDa that functions as a structural element
in the compaction of myelin.
So far, all seven mutations reported in CMTI B patients
are distinct mutations located in exons 2 or 3 coding for
the extracellular domain of P0. We also found two new
mutations in, respectively, exons 2 and 3 (Fig. 1, Table 2).
The extracellular domain shows similarity to members of
the immunoglobulin superfamily. It has been hypothesized that this domain takes part in myelin compaction by
homophilic interaction. The influence of these mutations
on P0 functioning is not known. It is possible that the mutation affects the homophilic interaction and therefore disturbs myelin compaction. Another possibility is that the
mutated P0 protein is not properly inserted into the
Schwann cell membrane and that, if it remains intracellular, it is metabolically toxic to the Schwann cell.
The two other mutations that we found are located in
exon 4 and, since both mutations are nonsense mutations,

they cause early termination of the translation resulting in
an aberrant P0 protein (Fig. 1, Table 2). The Tyr154stop
mutation involves the first codon of the transmembrane
domain of P0. The transmembrane and intracellular domains will therefore be completely deleted. The
Tyrl81stop mutation is localized in the cytoplasmic domain of P0 and will result in a deletion of the cytoplasmic
domain. The intracellular domain may function as a membrane adhesion molecule by electrostatic interaction with
acidic lipids or via protein-protein interactions (Lemke
and Axel 1985). Therefore, this domain may also be important for the compaction of myelin.
Autosomal dominant CMT1 is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. In the majority of CMT1 patients, a duplication of 1.5 Mb on chromosome 17pl 1.2 is present comprising the PMP-22 gene. In non-duplicated CMT1 patients, three single base mutations in the PMP-22 gene
have been described whereas seven mutations have been
detected in the P0 gene at lq21.3-q23. In this study, SSCP
analysis identified a pathogenic mutation in the P{~gene in
four out of 23 (17%) CMT1 patients, whereas no mutation
was found in the PMP-22 gene. These data suggest that
mutations in the P0 gene are more frequent than PMP-22
mutations. However, DNA data on a larger number of
CMTI patients will be needed in order to obtain an accurate estimate of the frequency of the different mutations in
CMT1 disease. Moreover, if a larger number of CMTI patients with a mutation is available, a correlation can be
made between the clinical expression of the disease and a
particular CMT1 mutation. Nevertheless, for DNA diagnostic purposes, it is worthwhile to test the non-duplicated
C M T I patients first for mutations in the P0 gene using the
SSCP conditions presented in this study.
