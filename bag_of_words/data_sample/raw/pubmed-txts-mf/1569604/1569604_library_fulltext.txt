represents a substantial advance in the
technology because there is, finally, a
defined antigen to use in tumor studies.
Similar studies with synthetic carbohydrates have also been reported (19). It
should now be possible to determine
whether these second-generation antibodies do indeed represent a practical and
useful advance. Serological tests should
be easier to perform. Whether antipeptide
antibodies have any selective in vivo advantage over those reacting with nonpeptide epitopes remains to be studied.

goal, it was important to screen the members of diverse-cancer-prone families for
the presence of germ-line p53 mutations
and to identify the location and type of
p53 mutations associated with LFS. We
previously proposed that cancer-prone
families could be effectively identified by
selecting members with childhood adrenocortical carcinoma, rather than sarcoma,
as candidates for the probands because of
the low incidence of adrenocortical carcinoma in the general population and the
frequent occurrence of this cancer in
patients with LFS. From 47 families, we
were able to identify seven cancer-prone
ones that had members with childhood
adrenocortical carcinoma (5). The criterion for the selection of these seven
families was that three or more family
members who were first-degree or second-degree relatives of the proband
developed cancer before age 45.
We tested affected members of two
families with LFS from whom tumor
specimens could be obtained for the
presence of germ-line p53 mutations. We
used polymerase chain reaction-singlestrand conformation polymorphism (PCRSSCP) analysis, a rapid and sensitive
method for detecting subtle mutations, and
found novel p53 mutations in individuals
from both of these families. This result indicates that a wide range of p53 mutations is
inherited in diverse-cancer-prone families.
The data obtained in this study should be
valuable for the more precise classification
of cancer family syndromes characterized
by diverse tumors and associated with inherited p53 mutations.

Subjects and Methods
Subjects

Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a dominantly inherited rare familial cancer
syndrome characterized by a high susceptibility to diverse malignant tumors (/,2).
Recently, germ-line p53 mutations have
been identified among members of six
families with LFS (3,4), indicating that
LFS is etiologically attributable to germline p53 mutations. However, since the
criteria for LFS have not yet been precisely defined, our purpose was to define
the spectrum of p53 mutations associated
with LFS to develop a gene-based classification system. To accomplish this
704

Seven cancer-prone families were
identified from a total of 47 families.
Those whose members had childhood
adrenocortical carcinoma were selected
as candidates for probands (5). In four individuals, two each from two of these
seven families, fresh surgical tissue specimens, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens, or fresh samples of peripheral
lymphocytes were available for genetic
analysis. Abridged pedigrees of these two
families are shown in Fig. 1. The diagnoses of tumor types were either confirmed by pathology records or obtained
by family history, as indicated in Fig. 1

by the filled or hatched symbols, respectively. Although family 1 conformed to
the original criteria for LFS proposed by
Li et al. (2), family 2 may not, because
we observed no family members with sarcoma or breast cancer.
Samples
From family 1, fresh samples of adrenocortical carcinoma tissue and of peripheral lymphocytes from the proband (III-I)
and a fresh sample of peripheral lymphocytes from his unaffected mother (II1) were obtained for genetic analysis (Fig.
1). From family 2, we obtained paraffinembedded specimens from both the
adrenocortical tumor of the proband (III4) and from the astrocytoma of the
proband's father (II-3), in addition to a
fresh sample of peripheral lymphocytes
from the proband's father.
PCR-SSCP Analysis
High-molecular-weight DNA from
fresh tissue samples was prepared by proteinase K digestion and phenol-chloroform extraction (6). DNA from paraffin-embedded samples was extracted as
described previously (7). PCR amplification was performed by using 250 ng of
genomic DNA as a template, one unit of
Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer-Cetus
Corp., Norwalk, Conn.), and three pairs
of p53-specific, unlabeled oligonucleotide primers. The primers for the following regions of DNA were synthesized
with a model 391A DNA synthesizer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster, Calif.) according to these published sequences (8):
5'-GGAATTCTTCCTCTTCCTGCAGTACTC-3' and 5'-GGAATTCAAACCAGACCTCAGGCGGCT-3' for exons 5
and 6, 5'-GGAATTCCTAGCACTGCCCAAC-3' and 5'-GGAATTCCTGACCTGGAGCT-3' for exon 7, and 5'-GGAATTCCTATCCTGAGTAGTGG-T-3' and
5'-GGAATCAAGACTTAGTACCTGA-3'
for exons 8 and 9.
Three separate amplification reactions
were carried out, one with each pair of
primers. In each reaction, the final concentrations of the reagents in a total reaction volume of 20 |iL were as follows: 10
m/W Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 m/W KC1, 1.25
mM MgCI2, 0.01% gelatin, the four

genetic analysis. To detect germ-line
p53 gene mutations in these individuals, we performed polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis with
Taq polymerase and oligonucleotide
primers specific for p53 gene sequences. Genomic DNA extracted from
fresh tissue samples and paraffin-embedded tumor samples was amplified,
denatured, and electrophoresed on
neutral polyacrylamide gels. PCR
amplification was also carried out
using total RNA from adrenocortical
carcinoma samples of the proband in
family 1. PCR products were purified,
subcloned, and sequenced. Results: We
detected novel germ-line p53 mutations
in affected members of both cancerprone families. In the proband of family 1, a single-base deletion was detected
at the first nucleotide of codon 307 in
exon 8 of the p53 gene, resulting in a
premature stop codon in exon 10. In
family 2, we detected an A to C transversion at the second nucleotide of
codon 286 in exon 8, both in DNA isolated from the adrenocortical tumor of
the proband and in DNA isolated from
the astrocytoma of the proband's
father. This single-base substitution
resulted in an amino acid substitution
of alanine for glutamic acid. Both of
these mutations are located outside the
highly conserved region of the p53 gene
where mutations in patients with LFS
have been reported previously. Conclusion: Our results indicate that a
wide range of germ-line p53 mutations
is inherited in members of diverse-cancer-prone families, fj Natl Cancer Inst

primer at a concentration of approximately 100 nM (10 pmol/tube). Amplification
was carried out for 35 cycles, each consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 40
seconds, annealing at 55 °C for 40
seconds, and extension at 72 °C for 90
seconds. After the last cycle, samples
were extended for 10 minutes at 72 °C.
PCR products were diluted 10-fold with
diluent consisting of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20 mM EDTA, and 0.05%
bromophenol blue, followed by a second
10-fold dilution with denaturing solution
containing 96% formamide, 20 mM
EDTA, and 0.05% bromophenol blue. A

Reverse Transcriptase PCR
To determine whether the single-base
deletion at the exon-intron junction of the
p53 gene in the proband of family 1
resulted in a splicing abnormality or a
frameshift mutation, we extracted total
cellular RNA from a fresh sample of
adrenocortical carcinoma tissue of the
proband in family 1, as previously
described {10). The first strand of comVol.84, No. 9, May 6, 1992

plementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 5 (j.g of total RNA as the
template, using 2.5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase as the
enzyme and oligo (dT),2.ig, a mixture of
oligomers of deoxythymidine triphosphates ranging in size from 12 to 18
nucleotide bases, as the primer. The final
concentrations of the reagents in a total
reaction volume of 20 \xL were as follows: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM
KCI, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol,
50 ng/|j.L of oligo (dT)|2_|8, and the four
deoxynucleotide triphosphates at a concentration of 1 mM each. The reaction
mixture was incubated for 60 minutes at
37 °C and then diluted with 80 (iL of PCR
buffer to make the final concentration of
the reagents as follows: 18 mM Tris-HCl,
55 mM KCI, 1.6 mM MgCI2, 0.01%
gelatin, and each of the two primers at a
concentration of approximately 100 nM
(10 pmol/tube). Subsequent PCR amplification of a region of p53 cDNA was performed using a pair of oligonucleotides as
primers: 5'-GGAATTCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGT-3'
and
5'GGAATTCAGCCCTGCTCCCCCCGGCTC-3' {8), 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, and the same Thermocycler program
used in the PCR-SSCP analysis above.

Germ-line p53 Mutation in Family 1
In family 1, when amplified fragments
of DNA from exons 8 to 9 in samples
were electrophoresed, we observed a shift
in mobility of the DNA fragments from
the proband (III-l), compared with fragments from the. proband's unaffected
mother (II-1). Aberrantly migrating
bands, in addition to the bands for the
wild-type allele, were detected in the
blood sample, while only abnormal bands
were detected in the tumor sample from
the proband (III-l). The unaffected
mother (II-1) of the proband carried only
the wild-type allele of the p53 gene (Fig.
2—family 1, panel A). When we sequenced exons 8 and 9 of the p53 gene in
this proband and his mother, we found a
single-base deletion of G at either the first
nucleotide of codon 307 in exon 8 or at
the first nucleotide in intron 8 in the
proband (III-l) (Fig. 2—family I, panel
B), but not in his mother (II-1). Since this
mutation was located at the exon-intron
junction, we further analyzed the p53
messenger RNA transcripts expressed in
the tumor by reverse transcriptase PCR
amplification and subsequent sequencing.
We found that this deletion occurred at
the first nucleotide of codon 307 in exon
8 and resulted in a frameshift mutation
but not an abnormal splicing (//); conseREPORTS 705

Since the primers used for PCR or
reverse transcriptase PCR had extraneous
nucleotides comprising EcoRl sites at
their 5' ends, the PCR products were
purified from agarose gels by phenolchloroform extraction, digested with
EcoR\, and inserted with T4 ligase into
the EcoRl site of the plasmid pUC18. To
confirm that sequence variations were not
due to misincorporation by Taq polymerase, we used DNA fragments pooled
from 100 to 200 plasmid colonies as
templates in the sequencing step {12). Sequencing was performed by the dideoxy
chain-termination method with a 7DEAZA sequencing kit (version 2.0; U.S.
Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, Ohio)

mutation was confirmed by sequencing
both strands of the DNA.

the adrenocortical carcinoma of the
proband (III-4) and in DNA extracted
from the astrocytoma from her father (II3) (Fig. 2—family 2, panel C). In conclusion, the p53 mutation detected in
family 2 by PCR amplification and subsequent sequencing of exon 8 did appear
to be inherited. Sequence analysis suggested that wild-type p53 genes were
retained in both of these tumors, although
we could not exclude the possibility of
contamination of the tumor specimens
with normal cells.

quently, a premature stop codon appeared
in exon 10. In conclusion, in one affected
individual of family 1, we detected a
germ-line p53 mutation that was a singlebase deletion of G at the first nucleotide
of codon 307 in exon 8 (Fig. 2—family 1,
panel C). Furthermore, analysis of the
tumor and peripheral lymphocyte samples
from the proband revealed that loss of the
wild-type allele had occurred during
tumor development and that only a
mutated allele was expressed in the
tumor.
Germ-line p53 Mutation in Family 2
In family 2, we first searched for germline p53 mutations using a DNA isolated
from a fresh sample of peripheral lymphocytes from the proband's father (II-3)
(Fig. 1), whose diagnosis with an astrocytoma had been histologically confirmed
706

and who was considered to be a carrier.
By PCR-SSCP analysis, we were able to
determine that a germ-line p53 mutation
was present in the region between exon 8
and 9 in this patient (Fig. 2—family 2,
panel A). Subsequent sequence analysis
of the amplified sequences of DNA extracted from the peripheral lymphocytes
of this carrier (II-3) revealed that the type
of mutation that was present was a singlebase substitution of a C for an A at the
second nucleotide of codon 286 in exon
8, resulting in the substitution of alanine
for glutamic acid (Fig. 2—family 2, panel
B). To determine whether this mutation
was inherited, we extracted DNA from
paraffin-embedded samples of both the
adrenocortical tumor of the proband (III4) and the astrocytoma of her father (II3). After PCR amplification, the same
single-base substitution was detected at

Discussion
W

We found novel germ-line p53 mutations in members of two cancer-prone
families. One was a G deletion at the first
nucleotide of codon 307 in exon 8, outside the highly conserved regions (codons
13-19, 117-142, 171-181, 236-258, and
270-286) of the p53 gene. The other was
an A to C transversion at the second
nucleotide of codon 286 in exon 8, the
last codon of the highly conserved region
V (codons 270-286) (13) (see Table 1). It
has been reported to date that p53 mutations in all six families with LFS were
present only in the highly conserved
region IV (codons 236-258) of exon 7
(13) and were single-base substitutions
causing amino acid changes (3,4). This is
the first report suggesting that either a
point mutation in region V or a frameshift
mutation of the p53 gene may predispose
carriers in cancer-prone families to
develop tumors.
Inheritance of germ-line p53 mutations
was strongly indicated in family 2 because the proband and his father carried
the same p53 mutation. However, we
could not determine whether the mutation
that we detected in family 1 originated
with the proband or was inherited, because no samples from any other affected
members of family 1 were available for
genetic analysis. Our study would have
been greatly strengthened if we had been
able to perform genetic analysis on samples from other individuals in family 1
(e.g., 111-2,111-3,111-4, or H-4).
We selected the two families in this
study by identifying members with childhood adrenocortical carcinoma rather
than members with sarcoma as candidates
for the probands. Family 1 was diagnosed

by review of clinical records to be affected by typical LFS, but family 2 may
not have been a typical LFS kindred because we observed no member with either
sarcoma or breast cancer (Fig. 1). However, we observed only a limited part of
the pedigree, and the tumors of certain
family members were confirmed by history only. In addition, the occurrence of
other tumors (e.g., gastric carcinoma,
common in Japan but atypical in members of families with LFS) is not enough
reason to automatically exclude a diagnosis of LFS for this family.
Molecular genetic analysis revealed the
presence of germ-line p53 mutations in
both of these families. Our results indicate that cancer-prone families with p53
mutations can be effectively identified by
selecting members with childhood adrenocortical carcinoma as candidates for the
probands. In conclusion, the present data
strongly suggest that we should genetically screen diverse-cancer-prone families
for the presence of germ-line p53 mutations to understand the pathogenic significance and etiologic role of p53
mutations in cancer.

solid tumors, we developed a method
which measures radiation-induced
DNA single-strand breaks in individual
tumor cells and makes use of the fact
that three times more strand breaks
are produced in aerobic than in
hypoxic cells. Methods: Immediately
after irradiation with doses of 4-20 Gy,
SCCVII squamous cell carcinomas
growing in C3H mice were removed
and cooled, and a single-cell suspension
was prepared. These cells were then
embedded in agarose, lysed in an
alkaline solution, subjected to electrophoresis, and stained with a fluorescent
DNA-bindir.g dye. The amount and
migration distance of damaged DNA
from individual cells were scored by
using a fluorescence image processing
system, where differentially radiosensitive aerobic and hypoxic cell
populations resulted in bimodal
damage distributions. Curve-fitting
routines provided quantitative estimates of the fraction of hypoxic cells.
Results: After the mice were exposed to
10-20 Gy, the SCCVII tumors (450-600
mg) were shown to have a hypoxic
fraction of 18.5% ± 10.6% (mean ± SD
for 11 tumors), which compares well
with the value of 11.6% observed using
the paired survival curve method. Conclusions: Our results indicate that this
method, which requires only a few
thousand cells, is a rapid and sensitive
way to detect hypoxic cells in solid
animal tumors. Implications: Estimating hypoxia in accessible human
tumors undergoing radiotherapy may
be possible if the sensitivity of the
method can be improved to allow detection of hypoxic cells after a dose of 2
Gy. [J Natl Cancer Inst 84:707-711,

squamous cell carcinoma growing in C3H
mice.

Materials and Methods
SCCVII squamous cell carcinoma cells
were transplanted subcutaneously over
the sacral region of inbred male C3H/He
mice that weighed approximately 30 g.
Tumors were used for experimentation
approximately 2 weeks later, when they
had reached a weight of 450-600 mg. To
provide a conventional estimate of hypoxic fraction, the in vitro paired survival
curve method (15) was employed as previously described (16). A common terminal slope was used to obtain
extrapolation numbers to the v axis for
tumor cells from air-breathing and asphyxiated mice, and confidence limits
were obtained from the limits for these
extrapolation numbers (15). For DNA
damage assays, tumors were irradiated by
placing unanesthetized mice in jigs and
irradiating the tumor with 250-kilovoltpeak x rays, using parallel opposed fields.
Immediately (within 30 seconds) following irradiation, mice were killed and
tumors were rapidly excised and placed in
ice-cold phosphate buffer. Preliminary
experiments indicated that we could obtain good estimates of hypoxic fraction
when tumors were excised 5 minutes after
a dose of 10 Gy. A single-cell suspension
was prepared by mincing the entire tumor
on an ice-cold surface and filtering the
suspension through a 70-|am nylon mesh.
Cells were diluted to a concentration of 4 x
104 cells/mL for the comet assay.
For the alkaline comet assay, a 0.5-mL
cell suspension was mixed with 1.5 mL of
a 1% solution of low-gelling-temperature
agarose, and slides were carefully submersed in an alkaline lysis solution containing I M NaCI and 0.03 M NaOH for 1
hour followed by a 1-hour wash in 0.03
M NaOH and 2 mM EDTA before
electrophoresis in a fresh solution of 0.03
M NaOH and 2 mM EDTA at 0.5 V/cm
(35 mA) for 25 minutes. Slides were
rinsed and stained for 10 minutes in 2.5
|ig/mL propidium iodide.
Individual "comets" were viewed using
a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope (Carl
Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, N.Y.) attached to
an intensified solid-state CCD camera
from ITT Electro-Optical Prods. Div.,

Fort Wayne, Ind., and an image analysis
system, an IBM AT computer and ITEX
100 board, from Imaging Technology Inc.,
Woburn, Mass., as previously described
(11,13). The "tail moment," proportional
to the percentage of DNA in the tail multiplied by the tail length, was used as the
measure of DNA damage. Histograms of
tail moments from 100 to 400 comets
were constructed and analyzed mathematically by determining the best-fit
parameters for two normal distributions
with means separated by a factor of 1.82.8 (the anticipated damage differential
due to oxygen). Inadequate resolution is
available to identify cells at intermediate
oxygenation levels. To achieve the fitting,
we used the Marquardt Levenburg algorithm, an interactive procedure.

Hypoxic cells are about three times
more resistant to killing by ionizing radiation than are well-oxygenated cells. There
is little question that hypoxic cells are
present in many solid tumors in humans,
and the presence of these cells can potentially jeopardize the success of radiotherapy and some types of chemotherapy
(1-3). Whether any particular tumor contains hypoxic cells and whether those
cells remain hypoxic throughout the
course of treatment, however, are currently
unknown. Moreover, the question of how
best to quantify tumor hypoxia remains
unresolved after decades of research, although there have been recent applications
of new oxygen electrode technology,
cryospectrophotometry, and radiolabeled
chemical hypoxia markers in human
tumors (4-6). Noninvasive imaging techniques (7-9) also show considerable
promise, yet they remain subject to the
uncertainties of resolution and the ability
to identify biologically relevant (i.e.,
clonogenic) hypoxic cells.
We have recently described a method
which measures DNA damage in individual mammalian cells. The "comet
assay," is based on microelectrophoresis
as first described by Ostling and Johanson
(10) and uses the principle that broken
cellular DNA will migrate more readily in
an electric field than undamaged DNA.
Recent extensions of the methodology permit detection of DNA single-strand or
double-strand breaks (11-13).
A linear relationship between damage
and radiation dose has been observed (13)
when using the more sensitive alkaline
comet assay for single-strand break detection; doses greater than about 1 Gy produced significant DNA damage in
individual cells. Since about three times
less DNA damage is produced in anoxic
than in aerobic cells when irradiated (14),
it follows that damage should be detectable in anoxic cells for doses exceeding
about 3 Gy. Consequently, it should be
possible to detect hypoxic cells in solid
tumors, even with low doses of radiation,
providing that tumor cells can be isolated
and processed prior to the occurrence of
significant repair, that little debris is present, and that the tumor contains a reasonable fraction of hypoxic cells. A
practical assessment of this approach is
presented here, using the murine SCCVII

Results

For comparative purposes, the fraction
of radiation-resistant hypoxic cells in
SCCVII tumors (0.45-0.6 g) was first
determined by the in vitro paired survival
curve method, where the ratio of highdose survivals for cells from air-breathing
and asphyxiated animals indicated a
hypoxic clonogenic fraction of 11.6%
with 95% confidence limits of 5.6%27.7% (Fig. 1). This value was deter-

differential routinely observed for a threefold difference in radiation dose for these

unirradiated cells was not subtracted).
Results shown in Fig. 3 indicate good
reproducibility for repetitive measurements from the same tumor cell suspension. In 11 tumors exposed to 10-20 Gy,

the hypoxic fraction (mean ± SD) was
calculated to be 18.5% ± 10.6%. Values
obtained for six tumors using a 4-Gy dose
indicate a higher (but not significantly
different) hypoxic fraction of 27.4% ±
11.0%. Both of these values are somewhat higher than the 11.6% hypoxic
population measured using the paired sur-

mined by fitting the 32 individual data
points (analyzed for three doses) on the
air-breathing curve and 12 data points on
the asphyxiated curve, using a common
slope, and determining the range in extrapolation numbers as described by
Moulder and Rockwell (75).
Using the alkaline comet assay, we
measured radiation-induced DNA damage in SCCVII tumor cells. For each experiment, at least 100 individual cells
were analyzed for the distance of DNA
migration and the fraction of DNA which
migrated. The tail moment, a descriptor
which reflects the fraction of DNA released from the cell nucleus and the distance migrated in the electric field, was
used as a measure of DNA damage
{11,13). Previous results using the comet
assay have indicated a linear increase in
tail moment as dose increases (13); the
rate of increase is dependent on the
choice of electrophoresis conditions.
Average tail moment was significantly
decreased in tumor cells of mice asphyxiated before irradiation with doses
ranging from 4 to 20 Gy (Fig. 2). In airbreathing mice, a subpopulation of less
damaged tumor cells was clearly visible.
It should be possible to define hypoxic
cells in a mixed population as comets
having tail moments equivalent to those
for anoxic cells receiving the same radiation dose. A technical problem arises,
however, in that it is not possible to ensure the same degree of damage or "repair" for each tumor excised. Differences
in tumor temperature and in time before
excision influence repair and small differences in electrophoresis conditions (buffer, voltage, and temperature) may alter
the apparent initial damage. Therefore,
the average amount of DNA damage (and
consequently the tail moments) could
vary for individual animals. For this
reason, a mathematical analysis is
preferable. Although this procedure is
not directly dependent on the total
amount of damage, it does include the
implicit assumptions that a bimodal distribution of damage is produced and that
the histograms are normally distributed
for both aerobic and hypoxic populations.
The proportion of these less damaged,
presumably hypoxic cells was estimated
by a curve-fitting program which constrained the oxygen enhancement ratio to
a value between 1.8 and 2.8—the damage

suggest that, at least for higher doses of
radiation, it may be possible to quantify
the hypoxic fraction without the use of an
imaging system. In addition to increasing
the versatility of the method, scoring
slides by eye would increase the number
of comets analyzed per hour and should,
therefore, improve sensitivity for detecting low hypoxic fractions.

Discussion
The alkaline comet assay can detect
hypoxic cells with good sensitivity, using
only a small sample size. The accuracy of
quantifying hypoxic cells naturally depends on the number of comets analyzed.
Using a sample of only 100 cells, we
might expect to reliably detect hypoxic
fractions of 10% or greater. Scoring 100
comets requires about 20 minutes for
identification, focus, capture, and image
analysis; but an alternative method is
simply to score comets by eye, using a
fluorescence microscope. Results with
viewers scoring slides "blind" indicated a
good correlation between the expected
and the measured hypoxic fraction using
a 15-Gy exposure (Fig. 4). Doses of
radiation as low as 4 Gy can be used to
detect hypoxic cells, although resolution
at these low doses is likely to be reduced,
and the problem of repair time becomes
more critical.
There are several advantages to the use
of this method to detect hypoxic cells. It
is considerably more rapid technically
than conventional methods (e.g., paired
survival curve and tumor growth delay)
used to measure hypoxic fraction in
murine tumors. The assay requires only a
few thousand cells; therefore, it should be
possible to use fine-needle aspirates and
to perform multiple measurements over
the course of radiotherapy. Combining
multiple fine-needle aspirates would be
feasible to ensure that a representative
tumor sample is analyzed. The method
does not rely on the preferential binding
of a hypoxia marker and, thus, avoids
problems of blood flow and drug delivery
(77), binding to stromal and other normal
cells (18), and nitroreductase activity of
the tumor cells (18,19). Radiation damage
itself is detected, and tumor cells, both
acutely and chronically hypoxic at the
time of radiation, are included in the
analysis. By analysis of individual cells,

the extent of damage is not critical, since
the response of the well-oxygenated cells
can be used as an internal control for the
hypoxic cells. Analysis of individual cells
is also important if tumors contain cells at
intermediate oxygenation.
Another important advantage of the
comet method is that the number of DNA
single-strand breaks produced by ionizing
radiation is independent of cell cycle
phase, cell size, or cell type (11). Investigators (14) have shown that the relationship between the oxygen content of a cell
and its radiosensitivity is similar, if not
identical, for single-strand breakage and
the more relevant clonogenic potential.
Since DNA content is measured for each
comet, it is also possible to separate the
response of tetraploid SCCVII tumor cells
from diploid nontumor cells (although we
did not do so here). Even without this
refinement, the presence of host cells is
not likely to be a limitation to the application of this method. Both host and tumor
cells can be found in hypoxic regions
(16), and both will be less responsive to
radiation and, therefore, indicative of
tumor hypoxia.
There are, however, limitations to this
method for detecting hypoxic cells in
human tumors. The most significant limitation is that a biopsy (fine-needle aspirate) is required immediately or shortly
after exposure to a dose of radiation in
excess of 4 Gy. We are exploring the application of different types of agarose and
electrophoresis conditions which might
allow detection of a hypoxic fraction after
a clinical dose of 2 Gy. A second limitation is that the curve-fitting program imposes specific assumptions which can
have a significant impact on the conclusions reached. A third problem is that
information on the clonogenic potential
of the hypoxic cells is not provided. With
respect to this last limitation, it should be
possible to at least assess viability, using
fluorescent dyes which are excluded from
intact cells or which must be metabolized
by viable cells. Fluorescence-activated
cell sorting, using fluorescent viability
probes, can easily provide the small number of cells required. While the feasibility
of using the comet assay for human
tumors remains to be explored, our results
with measurement of a hypoxic fraction in
an animal tumor model suggest considerable potential.

vival curve method. The large range in
hypoxic fraction and the use of different
tumors for the two techniques prevent any
firm conclusions about consistent differences between assays. It is also possible that not all hypoxic cells detected
using the comet assay can grow in the in
vitro clonogenic assay. Alternatively, the
rapid nonenzymatic dissociation procedure may release hypoxic cells more
readily than well-oxygenated cells located in healthy stroma (15), again resulting in a larger hypoxic fraction for the
comet assay compared with the in vitro
clonogencity method.
The ability of the comet assay to detect
subsets of cells in known mixtures was
examined by mixing aerobic cells exposed
to 15 Gy with aerobic cells exposed to 5
Gy, to mimic an oxygen enhancement
ratio of 3.0. The automated analysis program can identify hypoxic cells when
these cells are present at proportions
greater than 5% (Fig. 4). In addition to
analysis of data using the image processing system, three investigators examined
the same coded slides and scored comets
as high or low in damage, based on comet
tail length and fraction of DNA in the tail.
Results shown in Fig. 4 are promising and
