Tumors in Young Adults

ABSTRACT: Identification of patients at risk for developing brain tumors is important for the develop-

ment of preventative strategies. Because individuals with germline p53 mutations m a y be at increased
risk, we examined DNA from brain tumor-derived cell lines and malignant and n o r m a l nervous system
tissue for p53 gene mutations using the single strand conformation polymorphism assay and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA. We found mutations in the p53 gene in eight of
22 adult glioma tissue specimens and germline mutations in two of these eight patients. In contrast, mutation of the p53 gene was not detectable in either 16 glial tumors occurring in children, glial t u m o r tissue
from three unrelated glioblastoma multiforme patients with a familial history of cancer, or in benign men/ngiomas. One constitutional p53 mutation was a G to T transversion at codon 154, and the second was
a C to T transition at codon 256. Both patients with germline mutations developed glioblastoma multiforme before the age of 31, although the median age for glioma patients is above 50. These findings suggest that p53 germline mutations m a y identify a subset of young adults predisposed to the development
of high-grade astrocytic tumors.
INTRODUCTION

Recent studies identifying cancer patients w i t h germline
mutations of genes important for cellular proliferation and
maturation have suggested that such genetic alterations are
important risk factors for the development of specific malignancies. Genes associated with an enhanced p r e d i s p o s i t i o n
to brain tumors i n c l u d e NF-1, NF-2, and p53. Germline alteration of the NF-1 gene has been linked to a p r e d i s p o s i t i o n
for the d e v e l o p m e n t of neurofibroma as well as glioma [1,
2], whereas NF-2 inactivation is associated with schwannoma
of the VIIIth cranial nerve and m e n i n g i o m a [3-5]. The genes
encoding these p r e d i s p o s i t i o n s are now recognized to be tumor s u p p r e s s o r genes in w h i c h i n d e p e n d e n t events affecting both alleles are u s u a l l y required to inactivate their normal function [6]. These genetic events are typically mediated
by the deletion of c h r o m o s o m a l material, and they are often
recognizable as a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at a locus
closely linked to the t u m o r s u p p r e s s o r gene [7]. Occasion-

ally such deletions can be visualized as chromosomal abnormalities [8].
One of the most c o m m o n genetic abnormalities in brain
tumors is the LOH for c h r o m o s o m e 17, the c h r o m o s o m e on
w h i c h the p53 gene resides [9-11]. The p53 protein, w h i c h
is involved in n o r m a l cell cycle regulation, acts physiologically to suppress cellular proliferation [12]. Mutations of the
p53 gene a p p e a r to be the most c o m m o n genetic abnormality in h u m a n cancer. Point mutations w i t h i n the coding sequence of this gene have been detected in cancers arising
in the colon, lung, breast, brain, a n d n u m e r o u s other less
c o m m o n cancer sites [13, 14]. Mice deficient for p53 (homozygous for the null allele} are p h e n o t y p i c a l l y normal but develop spontaneous tumors at a higher frequency than heterozygotes by the age of 6 months [15]. Mice heterozygous
for an inactivated p53 allele are also susceptible to spontaneous tumors, but w i t h a delayed onset c o m p a r e d to homozygotes [16]. The most frequent t u m o r type in homozygores, malignant l y m p h o m a , also occurred at high frequency
in these animals, but sarcomas of bone and soft tissue were
the most c o m m o n t u m o r types [16].
Germline mutations of one allele of the p53 gene are now
recognized to be associated w i t h the Li-Fraumeni s y n d r o m e
(LFS) [17, 18], in w h i c h the familial occurrence of tumors in
both c h i l d r e n a n d adults has been observed [19]. Germline
p53 mutations have subsequently been reported in patients
w i t h m u l t i p l e p r i m a r y cancers, c h i l d r e n a n d young adults
w i t h second m a l i g n a n t neoplasms, and other patients without a k n o w n family history of cancer. Cancers w h i c h have

Germline p53 Mutations in Glioma
been found to occur in patients with germline mutations who
are not recognizable as members of LFS families include
breast carcinoma, osteosarcoma, and multifocal osteogenic
sarcoma [20-23].
In an analysis of 43 LFS families, 28 of 231 tumors occurring in family members were brain tumors. Only breast carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma occurred more frequently
[17]. Also, 35-40 % of astrocytic brain tumors that occur sporadically have a p53 mutation, and the incidence may be
slightly higher in high grade tumors than in tumors of a lower
histologic grade [24-28]. p53 mutations occur in other types
of central nervous system (CNS) tumors as well, but apparently at lower frequencies than in high grade astrocytoma.
In the literature to date, these tumors include four of 42
medulloblastoma, two of 19 oligodendroglioma, one of 18
ependymoma, and one of eight meningioma [27, 29-31].
The high frequency of brain tumors in LFS families [17],
the high rate of p53 somatic mutation in glial tumors [24-28],
and the recent observation of germline mutations in subsets
of patients with glioma [32] suggest that germline p53 mutations may play an unrecognized role in the etiology of astrocytic brain tumors. These subsets included patients with multifocal gliomas, glioma patients with a second primary tumor,
and patients with a family history of cancer [32]. No other
studies have identified germline p53 mutations in patients
who first presented for evaluation with an astrocytic tumor.
To further characterize p53 alterations in patients with brain
tumors, we have examined the DNA of selected tumors for
p53 mutations and studied the role of allelic loss as a mechanism of p53 gene inactivation. In this study we evaluated
DNA from 27 meningiomas, 22 gliomas of adults, and 16
gliomas of children for mutations in exon 5 to 8 of the p53
gene. Mutant genes were confirmed by direct sequencing of
the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA. Germline p53 mutations were sought in normal tissue from patients whose tumors possessed p53 mutations and was also
examined for p53 alterations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Human Tumor and Lymphocyte Samples
All tumor and normal tissues from patients with brain tumors
were obtained from the tissue bank of the Brain Tumor
Research Center, Department of Neurological Surgery,
University of California, San Francisco. The tissues examined included seven astrocytoma (including five mixed astrocytoma/oligodendroglioma type B), four recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma (RAA), 11 glioblastoma multiforme (GM),
22 benign meningioma, five malignant meningioma, eight
juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma, two pediatric astrocytoma,
five pediatric anaplastic astrocytoma, one pediatric GM, and
three GM that had occurred in individuals with a high incidence of cancer in their families. Tumors were designated
as pediatric when they occurred in patients under the age
of 18 years.

Glioma Cell Lines
Eleven cell lines derived from AA or GM were examined in
this study [33-36]. U87MG, U138MG, U251MG, and T98G

107
were obtained from American Type Tissue Culture Collection, Bethesda, MD [35, 36]. SKMG2 and SKMG12 were obtained from the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York [34].
SF126, SF188, SF210, SF268, and SF767 were developed in
Brain Tumor Research Center, University of California, San
Francisco [33]. All cell lines were grown and harvested as
previously described [37].

DNA Preparation
DNA was isolated from homogenized frozen tumor specimens, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and cell pellets of
glioma cell lines by standard methods [38].

Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP)
Analysis and Direct DNA Sequencing
Four pairs of oligonucleotide primers flanking individual
exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene were used to amplify DNA samples and to sequence PCR-generated fragments. The primers
used have been previously described from this laboratory
[22]. SSCP analysis and direct DNA sequencing were also
performed as previously described [22]. The DNA sequence
results were confirmed by sequencing both DNA strands
using the reaction products from at least two independent
PCR reactions.

Analysis of the Loss of Heterozygosity
The p53 single repeat polymorphic locus resides in the first
intron of the p53 gene (mapped to 17p13.1) [39]. It contains
a variable number of repeated oligonucleotide stretches,
(AAAAT)N, which can be examined by PCR analysis using
32p-end labeled primers whose DNA sequences correspond
to the regions flanking p53SR. The PCR products of DNA
from lymphocytes and tumors were fractionated on DNA sequencing gels and visualized by autoradiography. The
primers for the p53SR locus which we used were 5'-GTGGCACATGCTTGTAGTCC-3' and 5'-CAGCTCCTTTAATGGC A ~ - 3 : pYNZ22, another polymorphic locus, maps to the
short arm of chromosome 17 at 17p13.3 [40]. pYNZ22 contains
a variable number of 80 base pair (bp) tandem repeats (VNTR)
that can also be assayed by PCR [41]. Reaction products from
this locus were amplified in a PCR assay using 5'-CGAAGAGTGAAGTGCACAGG-3' and 5'-CACAGTCTTTATTCATCAGCG-3' primers, fractionated on a 2 % agarose gel, and visualized by ethidium bromide staining [41].

Cloning and Sequencing of DNA Fragments
from SSCP Gels
Single-stranded DNA fragments were purified by excising
individual bands from dried SSCP gels and incubating in
100 ttL of TE buffer. One-tenth of the eluant was subjected
to a second PCR amplification. These PCR products were
used as templates for DNA sequencing or cloned using the
TA cloning system (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). As indicated
in the text, DNA from individual clones were also used as
sequencing templates. All DNA sequencing was performed
using the dideoxy chain termination method and Sequenase
version 2.0 (US Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH).

RESULTS
p53 Mutations in Astrocytic
and Glioma Cell Lines

Brain Tumors

We used SSCP to examine coding regions of the p53 gene
for mutations in the region extending from exon 5 to exon
8 in b e n i g n and malignant tumors of the CNS (Fig. 1). We
examined 22 astrocytic brain tumors including seven astrocytomas, four RAAs, and 11 GM as well as tumors arising in
the meninges (see below). Eleven glioma cell lines were also
evaluated. No mutations were found i n the cell lines U87,
U138, SF767, and SKMG2. Six-point mutations and one intragenic deletion were detected i n the other seven cell lines
(Table 1). Cell line SF126 had an intragenic deletion of approximately 2 kb, w h i c h i n c l u d e d the entire region encoding exons 5 through 8 (data not shown). Cell line SF210 had
a TGC-to-TAC m u t a t i o n resulting in a cysteine-to-tyrosine
change at codon 175 in exon 5 of the p53 gene. Cell line T98G
had an ATG-to-ATA m u t a t i o n resulting in a methionine-toisoleucine change at codon 237 i n exon 7. Cell lines SF188,
SF268, U251, and SKMG12 all had mutations in exon 8 of
the p53 gene. Cell line SF188 had a GGA-to-GAA mutation
resulting in a glycine-to-glutamineacid change at codon 266.
Cell lines SF268, U251, a n d SKMG12 had the same CGT-toCAT m u t a t i o n resulting in an arginine-to-histidine change
at codon 273. All point mutations found in glioma cell lines
were G-to-A transitions and were associated with LOH (see
below).
Two mutations were found in the seven tissue specimens

of astrocytomas we examined (Table 2). In one tumor a CGTto-TCT mutation resulted in an arginine-to-leucine change
at codon 273 in exon 8 of the p53 gene. In the second tumor,
a 12-bp insertion was found at codon 174. Only one of four
RAA examined had p53 alteration. This mutation was a 7-bp
deletion that resulted in a premature translational stop codon
at position 244. Five of 11 GM had p53 mutations. Case 314
had a GGC-to-GTC mutation resulting in a glycine to valine
change at codon 273 i n exon 8. Case 454 had an AG-to-TG
mutation at the right j u n c t i o n of intron 6 that would be expected to alter the processing of p53 mRNA encoded by this
gene. Cases 15B and 515 both had mutations at codon 273
of exon 8 resulting in changes of arginine to leucine or histidine, respectively. Case 308 had two detectable mutations
in the regions of p53 we examined. We found ACA converted
to ATA at codon 256 in exon 7 and AGA converted to GGA
at codon 280 in exon 8. These mutations resulted in
threonine-to-isoleucine and arginine-to-glycine changes,
respectively.
Detection

of Germline

Mutations

We next examined normal tissue from all patients in whose
tumors we detected a p53 mutation. Normal tissue from two
of eight patients we examined had a point mutation of p53
identical to the mutation detected in the corresponding tumor tissue. DNA from both lymphocytes and tumor tissue
of patient 314 was examined by SSCP analysis to compare
the migration of DNA corresponding to exon 5 of the p53

Figure 2 PCR analysis of exon 5 of the p53 in normal and tumor tissue from glioblastoma multiforme patient 314.
A) PCR-SSCP analysis of exon 5 of the p53 gene in lymphocyte (L) and tumor (T) DNA from patient 314 compared
to the normal control (N). The arrows indicate migration shifts. B) DNA sequence analysis of exon 5 of the p53 gene
in DNA from lymphocytes and tumor tissue from patient 314 compared to the normal control. The solid arrowhead
indicates the position of the mutation. Numbers and amino acids correspond to codons of the p53 gene [61]. The
autoradiography shown is DNA sequence of the noncoding strand.

ever, the ratio between the intensity of the m u t a n t b a n d and
the intensity of the wild-type b a n d was greatly increased in
t u m o r DNA compared to lymphocyte DNA i n both the SSCP
(Fig. 2, panel A) and the DNA sequence analysis (Fig. 2, panel
B). These findings suggest that t u m o r cells possessed only
the m u t a n t p53 allele a n d the WT p53 allele detected in tumor tissue of GM314 originated i n normal stromal tissues
present in the pathologic specimen.
DNA from patient GM308 was not polymorphic for either
p53SR or pYNZ22 (Table 2), and we could not evaluate
whether inactivation of the p53 gene i n this tumor was associated with a conversion of homozygosity at the p53 locus
or not. As described above, this t u m o r was u n u s u a l i n that
SSCP analysis revealed mutations i n both exon 7 and exon
8 (Fig. 3, panel A). To examine the possibility that both alleles of p53 in this t u m o r were inactivated, SSCP analysis
of a DNA fragment s p a n n i n g exon 7 and exon 8 was performed. If the two p53 mutations were on different alleles,
we might see mobility shifts of both alleles and no bands
with a normal pattern of migration. SSCP analysis across exon
7 and exon 8 of the p53 gene of tumor DNA indicated only
one b a n d whose mobility had been shifted (Fig. 4, panel A,
b a n d 2), suggesting that the two p53 mutations were o n the
same allele. However, the observation i n this experiment of
a single migrating b a n d i n lymphocyte DNA suggested that

the detectable band might correspond to multiple, comigmting b a n d s (Fig. 4, panel A, band 1).
To further examine this possibility, band 1 and b a n d 2
(Fig. 4, panel A), w h i c h had been amplified from t u m o r tissue, were eluted from the gel, amplified by PCR, and their
DNA sequence determined. We found that these two bands
contained different ratios of WT and mutant (MUT) DNA.
Band 1 consisted of about equal amounts of WT and MUT
DNA at codon 256 (Fig. 4, panel B, triangle u n d e r exon 7)
and m u c h more WT DNA t h a n MUT DNA at codon 280 (Fig.
4, panel B, triangle u n d e r exon 8). In contrast, b a n d 2 contained more WT DNA than MUT DNA at codon 256 and about
equal amounts of WT and MUT DNA at codon 280 (Fig. 4,
panel B). This observation of apparently different ratios of
MUT to WT DNA in a single gel b a n d w h e n evaluated at
different codons suggested strongly that, while each of the
two bands contained mixtures of DNA with mutations at
codon 256 and 280, these two p53 mutations might be on
different alleles. To confirm this possibility, the PCR products of b a n d 2 were cloned and i n d i v i d u a l clones were sequenced. One clone was WT/WT and the other seven indep e n d e n t clones all contained the WT codon at position 256
a n d a m u t a n t codon at position 280. The DNA sequence of
one such clone is shown in Figure 4, panel C. The finding
that no two mutations were observed together o n one strand

other subgroups of brain t u m o r patients. We extended our
study to evaluate astrocytic tumors occurring in children and
e x a m i n e d n o r m a l tissue of three brain t u m o r patients from
families w i t h a high i n c i d e n c e of cancer. However, we d i d
not detect p53 mutations in these three patients or in any
of the 16 pediatric astrocytic brain tumors (eight juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma, two astrocytoma, five AA, a n d one GM)
we e x a m i n e d (Table 3).
Our observation that p53 was not altered in astrocytic
tumors of children was unexpected, since we and others have
found such mutations in approximately 40% of astrocytic
brain tumors, of all histologic grades, in adults. Since pediatric tumors generally have a less aggressive clinical course
t h a n tumors of similar grade occurring in adults, it seemed
possible that the occurrence of p53 lesions in brain tumors
might be more closely related to their clinical behavior than
to their histopathologic appearance. We therefore sought to
examine another CNS tumor, m e n i n g i o m a , in w h i c h variable degrees of m a l i g n a n t behavior have been recognized.
In the 22 benign and five malignant meningiomas examined,
we detected o n l y one mutant p53 gene. The SSCP analysis
of MMl163, a m a l i g n a n t m e n i n g i o m a , revealed a mobility
shift in exon 7 of the p53 gene (Fig. 1, Table 2). DNA sequencing of the PCR p r o d u c t from this case revealed an AGG-toGGG m u t a t i o n c o r r e s p o n d i n g to an arginine-to-glycine
change at c o d o n 249 (Table 2). We observed no evident allelic loss of p53 or pYNZ22 in this patient s p e c i m e n (Table
2). Since mutations at this codon, other t h a n the one we observed, have b e e n d o c u m e n t e d to alter the ability of p53 to
activate transcription, we infer that this change may be a prev i o u s l y u n r e c o g n i z e d d o m i n a n t negative mutation [43].

Cancer is thought to arise in association w i t h the accumulation of somatic genetic alterations in a single cell. Mutations
of the p53 gene are the most c o m m o n genetic alterations in
h u m a n cancer [44], although it remains unclear whether the
pathophysiologic contribution of p53 is similar in all t u m o r
types, p53 mutations seem to be relatively late events in the
development of colon cancer a n d m a l i g n a n t neurofibrosarcoma [45, 46]. These findings are c o m p a t i b l e with a role for
p53 in the progression of astrocytomas, as suggested by the
identification of p53 mutations in recurrences of tumors that
d i d not have detectable p53 mutations at initial presentation
[47, 48], and the observation of an acquired p53 m u t a t i o n in
association w i t h the histologic progression of a GM [48]. In
contrast, the identification of germline p53 mutations in the
hereditary cancer p r e d i s p o s i t i o n s y n d r o m e described by Li
and F r a u m e n i [19] suggests that p53 mutations may be important in t u m o r initiation [17]. p53 mutations are found in
some low-grade brain tumors, a finding compatible w i t h p53
inactivation being an early event in the development of astrocytomas (Table 3, [26]).
In the p r e s e n t study, we e x a m i n e d the p53 gone in different histologic grades of two different CNS tumors, astrocytomas a n d m e n i n g i o m a s , to further extend our understanding of the role of p53 in t u m o r progression. O u r results

m o r types. In m e n i n g io m a , mutation of the p53 gene as measured by our assay is a rare event detectable in only one of
27 t u m o r specimens. This p53 mutation was detected in a
specimen of malignant meningioma, consistent with the possibility that p53 mutation was associated with the progressive events involved in the malignant conversion of this tumor. This contrasts with our observation and the observations
of others that p53 mutations are detectable in all histologic
grades of astrocytic tumors [26]. While these findings may
identify m u l t i p l e biologic roles for the function of p53, it is
possible that what is perceived as a late biologic event in the
conversion of m e n i n g i o m a to a t u m o r w i t h malignant features is an early event in the pathogenesis of astrocytic tumors

that occur in adults. With few exceptions, all astrocytic tumors
we examined, regardless of their histologic grade, possessed
malignant characteristics of anaplasia and tissue invasiveness.
A previous analysis of 280 tumors with p53 mutations indicated that the spectra of p53 mutations observed in different tumor types is distinctive [14]. This finding has prompted
the suggestion that different environmental factors may be
of etiologic importance for the development of certain tumor types [49]. Selective G-to-T transversions at c odon 249
of p53 have been demonstrated in hepatocellular carcinomas
in geographic regions w h e r e aflatoxin is a k n ow n risk factor
[50, 51]. P53 mutations observed in lung cancers are also fre-

quently G-to-T transversions, a mutation known to be induced
by benzo(a)pyrene, a constituent of cigarette smoke [52]. In
skin tumors, a prevalence of C-to-T a n d CC-to-TT mutations
in p53 have b e e n observed, p r e s u m a b l y due to the physical
damage by UV light [53].
A l t h o u g h a n u m b e r of carcinogenic factors have been implicated in the d e v e l o p m e n t of brain tumors [54], we d i d not
discern evidence for a p r e d o m i n a n t type of mutation in the
CNS tumors we examined. G-to-A changes constitute the most
frequent t y p e of p53 mutations in brain tumors (75%) [14],
although o n l y one of eight mutations we detected in t u m o r
tissue was a G-to-A transition (Table 2). A l l six-point mutations detected in the glioma cell lines were G-to-A transitions
(Table 1). This d i s c r e p a n c y between the types of mutations
observed in cell lines and in t u m o r tissue suggests that G-toA mutations contribute to a selective growth advantage in
vitro, a n d p e r h a p s even occurred during the process of establishing these particular cell lines, rather than in vivo.
As noted above, the LFS is associated with a germline mutation of p53, and patients with this disorder are at increased
risk for the development of different tumors, i n c l u d i n g brain
tumors. In surveying large cadres of patients w i t h sporadically occurring tumors of the t y p e found among LFS family
members, the presence of germline mutations are very infrequently observed. Three germline mutations have been
detected in 363 breast c a r c i n o m a patients [55, 23]. Four of
181 sarcoma patients and four of 15 sarcoma patients w i t h
m u l t i p l e p r i m a r y cancers or a familial cancer history were
also observed to have germline mutations [21]. Seven germline p53 mutations (three of t h e m from patients w i t h a family history of cancer) were detected in 235 c h i l d r e n w i t h
osteosarcoma [56]. We identified two germline mutations
among the 11 tumors designated as GM w h i c h we studied.
Neither m u t a t i o n has been p r e v i o u s l y described as a germ-

line p53 m u t a t i o n or as a p o l y m o r p h i s m in a survey of 200
"normal" h u m a n tissues [21]. These novel germline mutations occurred in c o d o n 154, a region of p53 not r e c o g n i z e d
to be evolutionarily conserved [57], and in c o d o n 256, w h i c h
is in a conserved, frequently mutated region of p53 thought
to be of considerable functional significance [57]. We were
unable to determine if the i n d i v i d u a l s in w h o m we detected
p53 mutations were from families w i t h the LFS, since all
s p e c i m e n s in this s t u d y were a n o n y m o u s except for knowledge of the age, sex, a n d diagnosis of patients from w h i c h
they were derived (see below). We believe it is u n l i k e l y that
the two patients w i t h germline p53 mutations, one male and
one female, w h o m we detected came from LFS families because even among cancer patients LFS is very rare [19]. Also,
we d i d not detect p53 mutations in c h i l d h o o d astrocytic
tumors (Table 3). Recent data suggest that genetic background
influences the rate a n d s p e c t r u m of tumors that develop in
p53-deficient mice [58]. In a d d i t i o n to patients with the LFS,
patients w i t h multi-focal osteogenic sarcoma have b e e n recognized to carry a germline p53 m u t a t i o n [22]. It is p o s s i b l e
that several different cancer syndromes will be associated
w i t h germline p53 mutations, perhaps reflecting the genetic
background of different patient groups [58]. In this regard
our study supports the study reported by Kyritsis in w h i c h
none of the nine glioma patients in w h o m germline p53 mutations were observed were thought to be members of LFS
families [32]. Future studies to evaluate young patients w i t h
GM will be especially important in this regard.
The brain t u m o r patients in w h o m we detected germline
mutations were aged 29 and 31, respectively, w h e n they developed GM, a t u m o r that t y p i c a l l y occurs in patients older
t h a n 50 years of age [59]. Three previous studies examining
the p53 gene in patients with GM identified patients u n d e r
the age of 40 [28, 60, 32]. In two of these studies, among six
GM patients (aged 16, 17, 22, 27, 30, and 39 years) whose
tumors were characterized by p53 mutations, one 17-year-old
patient with GM had a germline lesion [28]. A third, more
recent study described the frequency of germline p53 mutations in subsets of glioma patients w i t h multifocal lesions,
family history, and other malignancies [32]. Three of five GM
patients (aged 27, 32, 32, 51, and 66 years) with germline mutations were u n d e r the age of 40. One patient had a family
history of cancer, a second had both a family history of cancer and m u l t i p l e malignancies, and the third presented with
a multifocal t u m o r and a family history of cancer [32]. These
findings s u p p o r t our current data that suggest young adults
w i t h GM may have a particularly high incidence of germline p53 mutations.
Our observation of germline mutations in young adults
with GM, a t u m o r that occurs most c o m m o n l y in the elderly,
suggests that there may be a subgroup of young adults w i t h
a recognizable p r e d i s p o s i t i o n for the development of highgrade brain tumors. C h i l d h o o d astrocytic tumors, w h i c h do
not t y p i c a l l y have p53 mutations (Table 3), are likely to be
pathophysiologically distinct from histologically identical
tumors that occur in adults. This possibility is consistent with
the observation that astrocytic tumors of the same a p p a r e n t
histologic grade have a distinctly different clinical behavior
w h e n they occur in adults a n d c h i l d r e n [59].
