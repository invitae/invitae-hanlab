Abstract
Distinct genotypic and phenotypic forms of methylmalonyl
CoA mutase (MCM) apoenzyme deficiency can be delineated
by biochemical analysis of mutant fibroblasts. One form, designated mut-, expresses a phenotype in which residual enzyme
activity is evident in cultured cells exposed to high concentrations of hydroxycobalamin. We describe cloning of an MCM
cDNA from cells exhibiting a mut- phenotype and characterization of the mutant gene product overexpressed in primary mut'
human fibroblasts and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Three novel
base changes were observed. Recombinant clones containing
one of these base changes (G717V) express four characteristics
of the mut- phenotype: failure to constitute 14Cqpropionate incorporation activity in fibroblasts assayed under basal cell culture conditions, constitution of 1[4Cjpropionate incorporation
activity in fibroblasts stimulated with 0.1-1.0 ,g/ml hydroxycobalamin, interallelic complementation with alleles bearing an
R93H mutation, and an apparent K. (adenosylcobalamin)
1,000-fold higher than normal. These results demonstrate that
the G717V mutation produces the mut- phenotype and localizes determinants for adenosylcobalamin binding near the carboxyl terminus of MCM. (J. Clin. Invest. 1992. 89:385-391.)

Introduction
Methylmalonic aciduria (MMA)' represents a set of inborn
errors of metabolism that result from inadequate function of
the enzyme L-methylmalonyl CoA mutase (MCM, EC
5.4.99.2). This enzyme catalyzes isomerization of L-methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA in the pathway by which propionate or propionyl CoA is metabolized via methylmalonyl CoA
to Kreb's cycle intermediates (1). The MCM holoenzyme is a
homodimer that contains 1 mol of an adenosylcobalamin cofactor for each mole of subunit (2). Distinct genotypic forms of
MMA are caused by defects in the MCM apoenzyme (designated mut MMA; McKusick number 251000; reference 3) or
defects in enzymes required for providing the adenosylcobalaR. Jansen's present address is Laboratorium coor Moleculaire Biologie,

min cofactor (designated cbl MMA; McKusick numbers
251100 and 251110; reference 3). Two distinct phenotypic
forms of mut MMA can be delineated by biochemical analysis
of fibroblasts from patients with MMA: mulP, in which fibroblasts exhibit no ['4C]propionate incorporation under any conditions or detectable MCM apoenzyme activity in vitro, and
mut-, in which fibroblasts exhibit ['4C]propionate incorporation when stimulated by high concentrations of hydroxycobalamin (4-7). This biochemical variation is thought to underlie
the varied clinical expressions of MCM deficiency, which range
from fulminant neonatal acidosis, multiorgan failure, and
death (8) to benign, persistent MMA without any corresponding clinical or developmental abnormalities (9).
Additional classes of mut MMA have recently been delineated by somatic cell complementation studies with mut°
WG1 130 fibroblasts (10). Somatic cell fusions between
WG1 130 and most mut- fibroblasts restore [14C]propionate
incorporation, apparently by interallelic complementation,
whereas fusions between WG 1130 and most mut° fibroblasts
did not complement ['4C]propionate incorporation.
We have reported cloning of the normal human MCM
cDNA, which comprises 2,798 bases and encodes a propeptide
of 750 amino acids (83,007 D) with a 32-amino acid mitochondrial targeting sequence and a 718-amino acid mature
apoenzyme (1 1, 12). DNA-mediated gene transfer ofthis clone
into primary mulP fibroblasts restores [14C]propionate incorporation to normal levels during the transient phase of recombinant gene expression after electroporation (13), confirming
that defects at this gene locus are responsible for the mut genotype. The recombinant MCM apoenzyme has been expressed
at high levels in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for biochemical analysis and has been shown to exhibit kinetic parameters indistinguishable from the native enzyme (Andrews, E., R. Jansen,
A. M. Crane, M. F. Wilkemeyer, D. McDonnell, and F. D.
Ledley, unpublished data). Of particular relevance to the present experiments is the fact that S. cerevisiae does not have
endogenous MCM (14) and does not produce adenosylcobalamin, so that the recombinant MCM produced in this organism
is entirely apoenzyme.
Several mutations have been identified in human MCM
(10, 15, 16), including two nonsense mutations (W1O5R and
A378E) that give rise to a classic mut° phenotype (16) and a
mutation (R93H) that exhibits interallelic complementation
(10) with mut fibroblasts. We describe here the cloning, sequencing, and expression of an MCM mutation expressing the
mut- phenotype and the characterization of the activity of the
recombinant gene product expressed in fibroblasts and S. cerevisiae.

GM 1673 fibroblasts were obtained from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (Bethesda, MD) Mutant Cell Repository and
were previously shown to express a mut' phenotype with low levels of
MCM mRNA (7). MAS and WG1 130 are mut' cell lines, the mutations of which have been described previously (10, 16).
Cloning and sequencing ofMCM cDNA. Total RNA was prepared
from confluent fibroblasts, and cDNA was synthesized and amplified
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Fig. 1) as described previously
(16). First-strand cDNA was generated from oligonucleotide 33 in the
3' untranslated region of the cDNA and used as a template for two PCR
reactions between oligonucleotides 53 and 28 and between oligonucleotides 23 and 21. The products of the 5' reaction were cloned into the
ClaI/KpnI sites of pGEM7zft+) using the ClaI site within oligonucleotide 53 and the internal KpnI site at base 720. The products of the 3'
reaction were cloned into the KpnI/BamHI sites of pGEM7zf(+) using
the internal KpnI and BclI sites. Double-stranded dideoxy sequencing
was performed using the T7- (Q501 1, Promega Corp., Madison, WI),
SP6- (Q512 1, Promega), or MCM-specific primers (Fig. 1). Clonal isolates were sequenced and compared with the sequence from a pool of
15 independent clones to confirm the authenticity of sequence variations. Oligonucleotide sequences are in reference 16.
DNA-mediated gene transfer and assay of["C]propionate incorporation in fibroblasts. An expression vector was constructed using the
normal human MCM cDNA (pCMV-hMCM) in the plasmid
pNAssCMV (17, 18), the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter,
the SV40 late viral protein splice donor and acceptor signals, and the
SV40 polyadenylation sequences (Fig. 3 A, clone F). Mutant clones
were constructed by substituting fragments from the PCR-generated
cDNA clones into the normal vector (Fig. 3 A). A BamHI/NsiI fragment containing H532R (base 1,671) was replaced in a subclone containing the 5' end of the normal MCM gene (Fig. 3 A, clone 1). A
NsiI/EcoRI fragment containing V67 11 (base 2,087) and G717V (base
2,226) was combined with fragments from the normal hMCM expression vector (Fig. 3 A, clone 2). Normal sequences corresponding to
V67 1I were restored by replacing a normal NsiI/AocI fragment, and
normal sequences corresponding to G717V were restored by replacing
a normal AocI/SalI fragment. Full-length clones were reconstituted by
three-part ligation from 5' NotI/NsiI and 3' NsiI/SalI fragments. All

Figure 1. Scheme for cloning and sequencing MCM cDNA. Firststrand cDNA was synthesized with oligonucleotide 33 (A). This material was added to two PCR reactions that amplify the 5' and the 3'
ends of the cDNA, respectively (B). The PCR products were subcloned into the ClaI/KpnI or KpnI/BamHI sites of the vector
pGEM7zf(+) and sequenced using the SP6 or T7 promoter primers
or oligonucleotides complementary to the MCM sequence as indicated (C). The oligonucleotide sequences have been published previously (21).

subcloned segments were sequenced to confirm the absence of artifactual sequence changes, and all gene expression experiments were performed with two independent subclones.
The clones were introduced via electroporation (19) into GM 1673
cells, which express low amounts of MCM mRNA and no significant
['4C]propionate incorporation under any conditions (7, 13). Electroporation was performed using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Richmond, CA) after a 5-min incubation of 0.3 ml of cells (density of
1.2 X 107/ml) with 10-20,Mg DNA, voltage pulses of260 V, and capacitance of 960,uF. MCM activity was assayed 2 d after electroporation by
['4C]propionate incorporation (7, 13, 20, 21).
Incorporation of ['4C]propionate into TCA-precipitable material is
dependent on MCM holoenzyme activity and provides a sensitive measure of MCM holoenzyme activity. [3H]Leucine incorporation was
measured to normalize for cell number and constitutive protein synthesis. The results are expressed as the mean nanomoles propionate per
micromole leucine incorporated in triplicate samples. Cobalamin reof mut cells was assayed by measuring ['4Cjpropionate
sponsiveness,
incorporation in the presence of 1.0 ug/ml hydroxycobalamin. Significant propionate incorporation is determined from the mean and standard deviation compared with GM 1673 controls.
Expression and enzyme assays in S. cerevisiae. The vector pYEPVhMCM for expression of human MCM in S. cerevisiae will be described elsewhere (Andrews, E., R. Jansen, A. M. Crane, M. F. Wilkemeyer, D. McDonnell, and F. R. Ledley, unpublished data). This clone
contains the human MCM open reading frame with truncated 5' and 3'
untranslated regions, the CUPlp promoter, 2s origin of replication,
and TRP-l gene for tryptophan selection (22) (Fig. S A). Sequence
fragments containing all three sequence variations or only G717V were
substituted into this vector on a KpnI/EcoRI segment by three-part
ligation of the mutant KpnI/EcoRI fragment with EcoRI/ClaI and
KpnI/ClaI fragments from the normal clone. The clones were introduced into the proteinase-deficient S. cerevisiae strain BJ3505 (TrplI,
Ura3Y), and expression ofthe recombinant gene was induced with 100
MM CuS04 when cultures reached an OD6w of 0.5. The cells were
harvested 4 h after induction by centrifugation; lysed using GlassperlenTM (B. Braun Melsungen, Melsungen, Germany) (0.45-0.5 mm) in
28 mM NaPO4, pH 7.0, 5 mM EDTA; and cleared of particulate matter by centrifugation.
MCM activity was measured in vitro using the potassium permanganate/perchloric acid method (23-25). Each reaction contained 50200Mgg crude extract, 100 mM Tris-PO4, pH 7.5, 0.5-2 mM D/L-methylmalonyl CoA (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), 160,000 dpm
D/L-['4C]methylmalonyl CoA (56 mCi/mmol, Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL), and 0- 1.0 mM adenosylcobalamin in a volume of
300,Ml. The reaction was incubated in the dark for 20 min at 30°C and
stopped by adding 100 Ml 2 M perchloric acid and boiling. The total
protein content was determined using a protein assay (BioRad Laboratories). Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and the results are
expressed as nanomoles succinate formed/milligram protein per hour.

Characteristics of DS79 (mut) fibroblasts. Diagnostic studies
of DS79 fibroblasts have shown that these cells belong to the
mut complementation group. Studies in our laboratory confirm that these cells exhibit no detectable apoenzyme in vitro
under standard assay conditions and no significant ['4C]propionate incorporation under basal culture conditions. The
addition of hydroxycobalamin to the culture at concentrations

of 0.1-1.0 ,ug/ml stimulated ['4C]propionate incorporation (7).
The diagnosis of mut MMA was confirmed by DNA-mediated
gene transfer, which restored ['4C]propionate incorporation
(13). Thus, we conclude that these fibroblasts exhibit a mut
phenotype analogous to the one originally described by Willard
and Rosenberg (4-6).

with 1 ,ug/ml hydroxycobalamin (Fig. 3 B, lanes C and E).
Thus, G717V alone was responsible for the impaired MCM
activity in DS79 cDNA clones.
Interallelic complementation between G717V and R93H
mutations. To test whether the G717V mutation exhibited the
complete phenotype of the parental DS79 fibroblasts, we investigated whether clones with G717V would complement the
R93H mutation (10). It has been shown previously that DNAmediated gene transfer of clones with R93H into the mut' fibroblasts GM 1673 (low mRNA phenotype) or MAS (heterozygous for W1O5R and A378E mutations) does not restore [14C]propionate incorporation, whereas DNA-mediated gene
transfer of the same clone into the DS79 fibroblasts increased
['4C]propionate incorporation (10). To replicate this phenomenon, equal concentrations of plasmids with the G717V, R93H,
W105R, or A378E mutations were electroporated into
GM 1673 fibroblasts in various combinations (Fig. 4 A) or into
DS79 (Fig. 4 B). ['4C]Propionate incorporation in GM1673
fibroblasts was not stimulated by vector alone, W1O5R,
A378E, R93H, or G7l7V. Combinations of G717V + W1O5R
or G717V + A378E similarly failed to constitute [14C]propionate incorporation, as did combinations of R93H
+ W1O5R or R93H + A378E. In contrast, cells electroporated
with G717V + R93H exhibited increased ['4C]propionate incorporation equivalent to that attained by transfer of R93H
clones into the parental DS79 fibroblasts (Fig. 4 B). These experiments demonstrate selective interallelic complementation
between the G717V and R93H mutations.
Characteristics ofthe mutant gene product. Segments of the
mutant cDNA bearing all three novel sequences or the G717V
mutation alone were substituted for normal sequences in the
expression vector YEPV-MCM (Fig. 5 A) and introduced into

Identification of mutations in DS79. Three differences were
identified between the sequence of DS79 and the consensus
sequence: H532R (a - g, base 1,671), V6711 (g -- a, base
2,087), and G717V (g t, base 2,226) (Fig. 2). All three novel
sequences were uniformly present in a mixture of 15 cDNA
clones, suggesting that these sequences were not PCR artifacts.
Thus, this patient is homozygous for all three novel sequences
or is a compound heterozygote in which the heterologous allele
is not represented in the cDNA clones (15).
To confirm that these sequence variations were responsible
for the mur phenotype, an expression vector that contained all
three changes was constructed (Fig. 3 A, clone A). This clone
was not capable of inducing ['4C]propionate incorporation in
mutP GM 1673 fibroblasts assayed under basal conditions, but
activity was stimulated when 1 gtg/ml hydroxycobalamin was
added to the culture media (Fig. 3 B, lane A). This stimulation
is quantitatively similar to the ['4C]propionate incorporation
observed in the parental DS79 cells without electroporation
(Fig. 3 C, BLANK) or after electroporation with the vector
alone (Fig. 3 C, CMV). These data demonstrate that the MCM
cDNA from the DS79 fibroblasts expressed the phenotype of
the parental cells.
Expression constructs were made with different permutations of the three potential mutations to determine which
amino acid change was responsible for the pathological phenotype. Clones containing only H532R (Fig. 3 A, clone B) or only
V67 11 (Fig. 3 A, clone D) induced ['4C]propionate incorporation (Fig. 3 B, lanes B and D) equivalent to that of a normal
MCM clone (Fig. 3 B, lane F). Clones containing both V67 I1
and G717V (Fig. 3 A, clone C) or only G717V (Fig. 3 A, clone
E) failed to constitute ['4C]propionate incorporation under basal conditions, but incorporation was evident in cells treated

The apparent Km values for the cDNA bearing all three sequence changes and the one bearing onl)y the G7 1 7V mutation
(Fig. 5 B) are consistent with the values reported from studies
of primary mur fibroblasts (4, 6). These data demonstrate that

that such cell lines contain

Km for adenosylcobalamin. We

found that clones that contain a single mutation, G7 17V, expressed four unique characteristics of the mut- phenotype: (a)
failure to constitute [14C]propionate incorporation in mut'
cells under basal culture conditions, (b) the ability to constitute
['4C]propionate incorporation in muto cells cultured with 1 ,ug/

We previously identified several m utations that cause m ut0
phenotypes in which enzyme activity is completely eliminated
(27). One is an amber mutation that terminates normal transla-

tion at codon 17 and leads to the translation of truncated gene
products from internal AUG codons (15), one introduces a
hydrophilic residue in a sharply hydrophobic region at the
center of the
phan residue

protein ( 16), and
to

one

alters

an

aromatic trypto-

arginine (16). We have also identified

a

muta-

tion in WGl 130 fibroblasts that exhibits interallelic complementation with most muF fibroblasts but not most mut' fibroblasts

(10).

Each

of

these

m utations

occurs

within

the

amino-terminal portion of the protein, and we have hypothesized that determinants in this region play a critical role in
catalytic function.
In contrast, this study identified three positions at which
the clones from DS79 differed from the consensus sequence of
other clones of normal and mut0 cell lines that have been sequenced in our laboratory. Each of these potential mutations is
near the carboxy terminus of the protein. One, H532R, is a
nonconservative substitution that does not interfere with enzyme activity, suggesting that it occurs in a region of the protein not intimately involved in function. Another, V67 1I, is
highly conservative. The pathogenic mutation is G7 1 7V,

which is not conservative because of the critical role glycine
residues play in the secondary structure, stabilizing (-turns and
disrupting both regular a-helical and (3-sheet structures. ChouFasman predictions of secondary structure (28, 29) for the normal and mutant sequences in this region suggest either that the
absence of the helix terminating glycine could enable an adjacent a-helix to extend further toward the carboxy terminus, or
that valine in this position could initiate (3-sheet formation that
would not be predicted for the normal protein (Fig. 6).
Homologous MCM genes have been cloned from mouse
and from the prokaryote Propionibacterium shermanii. The
murine enzyme exhibits 94% amino acid sequence identity and
similar kinetics as human (26). P. shermanii MCM is a heterodimer of homologous a (MUTB gene) and (3 (MUTA gene)
subunits (30, 31). There is a 59% identity between human
MCM and the P. shermanii MUTB gene and a 22% identity
between human MCM and the MUTA gene (32). The glycine
residue at position 717 is conserved in human, murine, and P.
shermanii MUTB sequences but not in MUTA (Fig. 6). There
is, however, little overall sequence preservation between the
eukaryotic and prokaryotic enzymes in the regions immediately surrounding this glycine. There is similarity in flanking
regions that could fold together to constitute homologous cobalamin-binding determinants. This pattern of homology predicts
that the effect of the G7 1 7V mutation may be to disrupt the
tertiary assembly of these determinants by introducing additional rotation at the end of a segment of a-helix or folding this
region deeper into the hydrophobic core of the protein.
The position of this mutation and the pattern of homology
between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic enzymes are interesting, considering the interallelic complementation observed
between G717V and R93H. It has been proposed that this
complementation may result from constitution of a single
asymmetrical catalytic center composed of cobalamin-binding
determinants from clones bearing the R93H mutation with
discrete catalytic functions remaining on mut alleles (10).
This is consistent with evidence that the normal enzyme binds
2 mol of adenosylcobalamin/homodimer (2) and with a model
in which the catalytic core is composed of two symmetrical
catalytic centers constituted in trans from determinants on opposite subunits. It is interesting that there is no apparent homol390

ogy between MUTB and MUTA in the regions surrounding
this presumed cobalamin-binding site, given the observation
that P. shermanii MCM binds only 1 mol adenosylcobalamin/
heterodimer (Leadlay, P. F., personal communication). A
more detailed picture of structure function determinants will
arise from knowledge of the tertiary structure ofMCM (33) and
additional characterization of natural or site-directed mutants
of the eukaryotic or prokaryotic proteins.
