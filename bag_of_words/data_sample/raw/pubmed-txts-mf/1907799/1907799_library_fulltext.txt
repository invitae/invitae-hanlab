Summary
A 20-bp deletion in the last exon of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) Ela gene was found in a severely
affected female patient diagnosed with PDH deficiency. PDH-complex activity in the patient's fibroblasts
was 22% of that in normal controls. The mutation was characterized using PCR techniques with both patient
cDNA and genomic DNA, followed by sequencing of the products. E113 cDNA sequence was found to be
the same as that in controls. The deletion causes a frameshift and the occurrence of a premature stop codon.
Western blot analysis revealed an extra band migrating just above the PDH E113 band. Northern blot analysis
showed normal levels of both Eia and Elp1 message when probed with the respective cDNAs. However, a
larger intermediate-size transcript was observed for this patient in the Elp blot. The 20-bp deletion was not
found in either parent's genomic DNA, and hence we conclude that the mutation must have occurred de novo,
either in the germ-line cells or immediately following fertilization.

Introduction

The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex plays a
central role in energy metabolism. This multienzyme
complex is composed of three catalytic enzymes: PDH
(El), dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) (Randle et al.
1978). El, an OL242 tetramer, contains the main sites
for regulation of the PDH complex, specifically on the
Ela subunit. Regulation is by a phosphorylationdephosphorylation mechanism (Linn et al. 1969). The
Ela subunit also contains the thiamine pyrophosphate
binding site which plays an important role in the decarboxylation of pyruvate (Hawkins et al. 1989).
Genetic defects in the PDH complex are one of the
most common causes of congenital childhood lactic
acidemia (Robinson 1980). Clinical presentation of
patients with PDH-complex deficiency is extremely
heterogeneous. Mildly affected patients suffer only

from ataxic episodes, while severely affected patients
develop fatal lactic acidosis (Robinson et al. 1980,
1987). In addition to the metabolic disturbance, structural central nervous system damage seems to be a
characteristic feature of PDH deficiency.
Human PDH-complex deficiency is usually diagnosed by measurement of PDH-complex activity in
cultured fibroblasts or tissue, along with immunochemical analysis of the protein subunits. In the majority of cases, the defect seems to lie in the E1 enzyme,
an a2 12 tetramer of subunit Mr 41,000 and 36,000,
respectively, for a and 13 components. The cDNA sequences for both E1a and E13 have now been elucidated in our own and other laboratories (Dahl et al.
1987; DeMeirleir et al. 1988; Koike et al. 1988; Ho
et al. 1989; Chun et al. 1990). The E1a gene has been
localized to the p22.1-p22.2 region of the X chromosome (Brown et al. 1989), and its gene structure has
been determined (Maragos et al. 1989). There have
been two different frameshift mutations in the PDH
Ela gene described in patients with PDH deficiency
(Endo et al. 1989; Dahl et al. 1990). Here, we report
on a female patient with PDH deficiency in whom
some normal PDH E1a protein is present, while, because of the presence of a frameshift mutation, some
E1a protein is produced as a truncated smaller version.

Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Deficiency
Subject and Methods
Case Report
A female patient, AF, birth weight 1.88 kg, was
born at 35 wk gestation and required intubation and
ventilation in the immediate postnatal period. The
baby continued to be lethargic and hypotonic and
showed little psychomotor development in the following months. At age 7 mo she developed some seizure
activity and was found to have an abnormal EEG;
blood lactate and blood pyruvate were elevated, and
she had mild hepatosplenomegaly. When seen at age
12 mo for an episode of pneumonia, she was observed
to be profoundly retarded, with some facial dysmorphism, and her weight had increased to 9.3 kg.
Blood lactate levels at that time varied between 5.0
and 15.8 mM. Simultaneous measurement of blood
lactate (5.46 mM) and blood pyruvate (0.21 mM)
gave a lactate-to-pyruvate ratio of 25:1. A computed
tomography scan of the head showed dilated ventricles
and cortical thinning. At this point, a diagnosis of
PDH deficiency was made on the basis of the low activity in cultured skin fibroblasts. In the ensuing 2 years
she showed little further development, and she died at
the age of 3 years.
Cultured skin fibroblasts were grown from the patient from a forearm skin biopsy in a-MEM culture
medium. The activity of the PDH complex in the native and dichloroacetate (DCA)-activated state was determined in fibroblast extracts by the method of Sheu
et al. (1981). The activities of the E1 pyruvate decarboxylase, the E2 transacetylase, and the E3 lipoamide
dehydrogenase were determined as described previously (Robinson et al. 1980; MacKay et al. 1986).
Cytochrome oxidase was measured by the method of
Glerum et al. (1987).
mRNA, cDNA, and DNA Preparation
Total RNA was purified from cultured skin fibroblasts of patient AF by the method of Maniatis et al.
(1982). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using approximately 20 gg of total cellular RNA and an E1a

gene-specific oligonucleotide, aG17 (5'-GTACAAACTGCATGCAATTACTACC-3'). M-MLV reverse
transcriptase (Moloney murine leukemia virus) was
purchased from BRL, and RNA Guard® ribonuclease
inhibitor and the deoxynucleotides were purchased
from Pharmacia. The first strand of the ElD cDNA
was synthesized using oligo dT (Pharmacia) as the
primer. DNA was prepared from cultured skin fibro-

blasts by a modified version of the method of Miller
et al. (1988).
Western Blot Analysis

Samples of human cultured skin fibroblasts were
subjected to digitonin and Triton X-100 extraction,
and the Triton extracts were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. This gel was then electroblotted onto
nitrocellulose and probed with rabbit and-bovine
heart PDH-complex antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by goat anti-rabbit IgG and
horseradish peroxidase staining.
Northern Blot Analysis

Purified total RNA samples from human skin fibroblasts were run through a 1% agarose gel containing formamide (Davis et al. 1986). The RNA was
then transferred onto Hybond membrane (Amersham)
and probed with random primer 32P-labeled cDNA,
initially for PDH E1a and later for PDH E1i (DeMeirlier et al. 1988; Chun et al. 1990).

Amplification of DNA
cDNA and genomic DNA were amplified by the PCR
(Saiki et al. 1988). Conditions were as recommended
by the manufacturer of Taq polymerase (Promega).
Synthetic oligonucleotide primers used in the El a cDNA
amplification were aG21 (5'-GTAGAATTCTCGTGCCTCCTGGGTTGTGA-3'), AVA-R (5'-TCTCGGACGGAAAGGCCCCG-3'), AVA-F (5'-TCACGGCTTTACTTTCACCC-3'), and aGl7' (5'-TCTAGAATTCGTACAAACTGCATGCAATTAC-5'). Synthetic oligonucleotide primers used in the Elp cDNA
amplification were OiG14 (5'-GACCAAGcTtGCGGCGGTGTCT-3') and ,BG12 (5'-CCAGGatCcGTGCCAGCAAGTATTT-3') lowercase letters indicate artificially induced mismatches for ease in subcloning.
Synthetic oligonucleotide primers used in the amplification of exon 11 of E1a in genomic DNA were El iF
(5'-TTTAGGAAtTcGATGTGGAAGT-3') and El R
(5'-CTGACaagCTTAAACTTGATCCAC-3'). A cycle
consisted of denaturation at 94°C for 60 s; annealing- at 61 0C (for E1a cDNA fragment A), 550C (for
Ela cDNA fragment B), 570C (for E1lp cDNA), or
470C (for genomic DNA)-for 60 s; and extension at
720C for 90 s (for cDNAs) or 60 s (for genomic DNA).
After 30 cycles, the amplified fragments were visualized on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels (BRL).

DNA Sequence Analysis

Amplified DNA fragments were subcloned into
plasmid pSP65 (Boehringer Mannheim) for sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed by the Sanger
dideoxy chain-termination method on double-stranded
templates, using a T7 polymerase sequencing kit (Pharmacia) (Sanger et al. 1977).

Results

Biochemical investigations (table 1) revealed a defect in the activity of the PDH complex in which the
DCA-activated state was 22% of the activity found in
controls. The E1 pyruvate decarboxylase component
of the complex was 18% of the activity in controls. E2

and E3 values were in the normal range of activities,
the activity of cytochrome oxidase.

Western and Northern Blot Analysis

A western blot of seven PDH complex-deficient patient fibroblast cell lines (fig. 1, lanes 1-7) and one
control cell line (fig. 1, lane 8) was probed with antiPDH-complex antibody (fig. 1). Two patient cell lines
(fig. 1, lanes 5 and 7) had no significant amounts of
either Ela or E1,l protein. One patient (fig. 1, lane 2)
had two faint Eia bands, and patient AF (fig. 1, lane
4) had a second protein band immediately above the
Elp band. Examination of mRNA levels for the E1a
and E1p subunits, after northern blotting with the respective cDNA probes, revealed normal message levels

for both the a and ,B subunits in the deficient cell lines
tested (fig. 2). However, patient AF also displayed an
anomolous intermediate-size species of mRNA when
probed with the E1d cDNA (fig. 2, lane 2).
Characterization of the Mutation

Total RNA was prepared from cultured skin fibroblasts and used as a template for cDNA synthesis of
the coding region of PDH E1a. This cDNA was then
used to generate two fragments (A and B; fig. 3) by
PCR, as described in the Subject and Methods section

above. Subcloning and sequencing made it apparent
that the patient had two distinct sequences for the
E1a cDNA, one which was normal and one which
contained a 20-bp deletion (fig. 4). Amplification and
sequencing of the patient's cDNA for PDH E1lp
showed only normal sequence, identical to that found
in control subjects.
Amplification of exon 11 of the PDH E1a gene
(Maragos et al. 1989) by PCR for patient genomic
DNA showed a triple band when the products were
run on a 1.5% agarose gel. Along with the normal size
band (166 bp) was a second, smaller band (146 bp)
and a larger, third band (fig. 5). Subsequent subcloning and sequencing of the two lower bands revealed
that the 166-bp fragment contained the normal exon
11 sequence, whereas the smaller fragment contained
a 20-bp deletion seen in the cDNA prepared from message. The upper band was thought to be a heteroduplex of the 146- and 166-bp bands. The conclusion
was that the patient exhibited heterozygosity at this
locus, one allele having a 20-bp deletion starting at
nucleotide 1144 (fig. 6) and one allele being normal.

PCR products of the normal gene (156 bp) and the mutant gene
(136 bp) are shown on the right. Lane 1, DNA size marker. Lane

The 20-bp deletion causes a frameshift that a premature stop codon is created at nucleotide 1197. PCR
amplification of exon 11 of the parents of the patient
revealed that both had only normal versions of the
gene present in fibroblast DNA.
Discussion
A mutation was found in the PDH Ela gene of a
female patient who suffered from severe lactic acidosis. cDNA sequence analysis of her PDH Ela gene

revealed a normal sequence and one with a 20-bp deletion, causing a frameshift mutation (fig. 6). Subsequent DNA sequence analysis of exon 11 of the PDH
E1a gene again revealed one normal version and one
with the same 20-bp deletion as found in the cDNA.
Not only is there a deletion of amino acids that is due
to the actual 20-bp deletion, but the frameshift causes
a premature stop codon to appear 46 bp upstream of
the real stop codon (fig. 6). Hence we would expect
the mutant PDH Ela protein to be 15 amino acids
shorter than the normal one of 390 amino acids (including the 29-amino-acid leader sequence). In addition, the frameshift also alters the amino acid sequence
from the normal protein (fig. 6), at the C terminus.
This in turn predicts that there are two potential
protein products of the PDH El a gene - one of normal
molecular mass (41 kb) and one of lower molecular
mass (rv38 kb) that is produced by the deleted Ela
gene. The anomolous band seen in the protein electrophoresis is not, as was originally hypothesized, an abnormal version of the El3 protein but is in fact a shortened version of the Ela protein. Northern blotting
also pointed to EI$ as a potential problem because
an accumulation of unprocessed higher-molecularweight mRNA was evident in the total mRNA prepared from the patient cell line. It is possible that some
feedback inhibition of mRNA processing is occurring
as a result of the formation of nonfunctional PDH
complexes. However, there is no evidence of this happening in other PDH Ela-defective cell lines, even
when there is little cross-reacting material present in
the cells.
After activation, the cultured skin fibroblasts display a PDH-complex activity that is of 22% of that
found in controls (table 1). The activity of the pyruvate
decarboxylase (El) component was found to be 18%
of the control value. Clearly, in this particular case

Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Deficiency
we do not have the simple 50% reduction in enzyme
activity of the complex that would be predicted from
the one-gene, one-transcript model of enzyme synthesis. There are two plausible explanations for these
findings. The first explanation is based on the fact that
the location of the Ela gene on the X chromosome
makes it subject to random inactivation in females
(Lyon 1988). It could be deduced that some 80% of
the cells in this culture had normal Ela genes that had
been randomly inactivated, leaving 80% of the Ela
production in the hands of the defective genes producing short transcripts. There is no evidence from the
western blot that this is so. It would seem that complexes formed from the abnormal Ela translation
products are stable, even if inactive. An alternative
explanation is that, when stable products are formed
in the a2 2 tetramer from the normal gene a and from
the abnormal gene as, the complexes formed will be
asl1h, asasOiB, aasOiO, and aarop, only the last version
being active. The resulting activity would be 25% of
normal. However, this would imply that random inactivation had not taken place and that both transcripts
were being produced in the same cell.
Since the parents appeared to possess only normal
DNA in their skin fibroblast cultures, we can only
assume that in this family we are dealing with a germline mutation. However, we could not make a concrete diagnosis, as the clinical presentation of heterozygous females carrying defective X-linked depends on
the pattern of X-chromosome inactivation. To check
whether either parent carried the same defective PDH
Ela as did the patient, genomic fibroblast DNAs of
both parents were amplified in the same set of PCR
reactions as was the patient's (fig. 5). No 20-bp deletion was found in either parent's DNA, confirming
that the origin of the defect was indeed germ line. In
the cases previously reported, the Ela deletions occurred at the 3' end of the cDNA sequence (Endo et
al. 1989; Dahl et al. 1990). It is interesting that the
deletion in patient AF also occurs at the 3' end of
the cDNA sequence. Unlike the two reported cases,
however, the 20-bp deletion is not part of a tandem
direct-repeat sequence. Nevertheless, 22 bp downstream of the 20-bp deletion is a 20-bp region which
is 75% homologous to the deletion (fig. 6). Whether
this is just a coincidence or whether there is a significance to it is still unknown.
