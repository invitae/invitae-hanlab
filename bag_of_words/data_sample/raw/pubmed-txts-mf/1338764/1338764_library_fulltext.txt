We report here the result of a screening for germ-line mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli
(APC) gene in 61 new familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients as well as a summary of the
results of 150 patients. Examination of the entire coding region of the APC gene, based on a ribonuclease protection assay coupled with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), disclosed mutations that
were considered to cause significant defects in the APC product in 97 of 150 unrelated FAP patients.
Our findings revealed the following characteristics of the germ-line mutations of APC: 1 ) the great
majority of the mutations were found to truncate the APC product; 2) almost all of the mutations were
located within the first half of the coding region; 3) no correlation was observed between the locations
of germ-line mutations and extracolonic manifestations in FAP patients; 4) more than 80% of base
substitutions in the APC gene were from cytosine to other nucleotides, nearly one-third of which
occurred at the CpG site. Our results provide information helpful to an understanding of the APC gene
and will also contribute to presymptomatic diagnosis of members in FAP families.

INTRODUCTION
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal-dominant inherited disease with high penetrance. This condition is characterized by numerous adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum
and is sometimes associated with extracolonic
manifestations (Utsunomiya, 1989, 1990; Bussey,
1975; Buelow, 1987; Haggitt and Reid, 1986;
Spigelman et al., 1989). If these polyps are left
without surgical treatment, one or more colorectal
carcinomas will develop in affected individuals.
The gene responsible for FAP, the adenomatous
polyposis coli (APC) gene, was isolated in 1991
(Kinzler et al., 1991a; Nishisho et al., 1991; Groden et al., 1991; Joslyn et al., 1991); since then,
germ-line mutations of the gene in FAP patients,
0 1992 WILEY-LISS.INC.

as well as somatic mutations of the APC gene in
colorectal tumors and gastric carcinomas have
been reported (Nishisho et al., 1991; Groden et
al., 1991; Miyoshi et al., 1992a,b; Nagase et al.,
1992; Miki et al., 1992; Horii et al., 1992; Fodde
et al., 1992). In our previous studies, we identified
germ-line mutations of the APC gene in 63 of 89
FAP patients examined (Nishisho et al., 1991;
Miyoshi et al., 1992a; Nagase et al., 1992). Groden et al. (1991) found only 4 mutations in 61
FAP kindreds by testing a large portion of the APC

gene using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and Fodde et al. (1992) identified
mutations in 8 of 33 unrelated Dutch FAP patients
by examining 10 exons using denaturing gradient
gel electrophoresis.
We report here a summary of the results of 150
patients and a comparison of the germ-line mutations with clinical characteristics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Genomic DNA of FAP Patients

DNAs or blood materials derived from 150 unrelated FAP patients were obtained from 10 laboratories; 7 of them in Japan (61 patients), 2 in the
United States (65 patients), and 1 in the United
Kingdom (24 patients). Among 150 patients,
germ-line mutations of the APC gene in 61 unrelated FAP patients were examined in this study; 13
in the United States, 24 in the United Kingdom,
and 24 in Japan. The results of 89 patients were
reported previously (Nishisho et al., 1991; Miyoshi
et al., 1992a; Nagase et al., 1992). Genomic
DNAs from individuals with FAP were prepared
from white blood cells as described elsewhere (Sato
et al., 1990). Clinical information about each patient was obtained from the laboratories providing
the specimens.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

The coding region of the APC gene was divided
into 31 segments and each of them was separately
amplified using PCR as reported previously (Miyoshi et al., 1992a; Saiki et al., 1986). The primer
pairs used in this study were also described previously (Miyoshi et al., 1992). PCR was performed
with 38 cycles for 0.5 min at 95"C, 2 min at 51"C,
and 2 min at 70°C as described by Baker et al.

(1990).

RNase Protection Analysis

The PCR products were analyzed by RNase protection assays for screening germ-line mutations
(Winter et al., 1985; Kinzler et al., 1991b).
Briefly, the PCR products were hybridized to 32Plabeled RNA transcripts corresponding to normal
APC sequence and the hybrids were digested with
RNase A, which cleaves at mismatches within
DNA-RNA hybrids. The sizes of the digestion
products were determined by polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis with autoradiography.
Cloning and Sequence Analysis

PCR products showing extra bands in the
RNase protection analyses were cloned into a plas-

mid vector (pBluescript SK, Stratagene, La Jolla,
CA) as described elsewhere (Nishisho e t al.,

1991). A t least 50 subclones were pooled and
DNAs were extracted as sequence templates. DNA
sequencing was carried out according to the
method described by Nigro et al. (1989).
RESULTS
Mutation Analysis

In a total of 97 among 150 FAP patients tested,
we detected germ-line mutations that were considered to significantly affect the biological activity of
the APC protein; among the 97 patients, 44 were
American, 15 were English, and 38 were Japanese.
Examples of these altered DNA sequence are
shown in Figure 1; Figure 1A reveals a nonsense
mutation and Figure 1B a 7-base pair deletion. Details of the mutations found in the 34 of 61 patients
screened in this study are summarized in Table 1.
Fifty-nine of the 97 were frameshift mutations
caused by insertions or deletions of nucleotides
that created new termination codons downstream;
56 of these were 1- to 8-bp deletions and 3 were 1or 2-bp insertions. Thirty-seven cases were point
mutations: 31 nonsense and 6 missense mutations.
The remaining case had a 1-bp deletion within an
intron near the intron-exon junction. The great
majority of the germ-line mutations (90 of 97)
would be predicted to truncate the APC product.
Nucleotide changes involving point mutations are
summarized in Table 2; 30 of 37 were alterations
from cytosine to another nucleotide.
Distribution of the Germ-Line Mutation

Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of germ-line
mutations along the APC gene in 97 FAP patients.
Nearly three-fourths of the mutations were detected within the 5' half of exon 15 that consists of
more than 6,000 nucleotides. The mutations at 9
sites were found in more than 1 FAP kindred. Mutation at codon 1061, codon 1309, or codon 1465
was observed in 30 FAP patients (observed in all 3
nationalities tested); together, these 3 sites now
account for 31% of the germ-line mutations so far
detected. In particular, a 5-bp deletion at codon
1309, detected in 17 FAP patients, covers more
than 10% of the 150 patients examined and nearly
20% of the germ-line mutations so far detected.
Only 3 of the 97 mutations were located within the
3' half of the APC coding region. Point mutations
were scattered through exons 1-14, although 55 of
the 59 frameshift mutations occurred within the 5'
half of exon 15.

SUMMARY OF APC GERM-LINE MUTATIONS

469

Six of the 29 patients showed no extracolonic
manifestations. From these results, no clear correlation was observed between the location of any
germ-line mutation of the APC gene and clinical
manifestations. Three patients carrying the same
mutation (CGA-TGA at codon 302) had different clinical phenotypes: patient 24 was affected
only in the colon and the other 2 patients suffered
from extracolonic manifestations. However, it
might be notable that of 3 patients who carried the
mutation identified at codon 1465, all showed a
large number of extracolonic benign tumors.
Polymorphisms in the APC Gene

In addition to 10 polymorphisms in the APC
gene reported previously (Groden et al., 1991;
Miyoshi et al., 1992a; Fodde et al., 1992), we
detected 10 new rare polymorphisms in this study.
All available information about these 20 polymorphisms is summarized in Table 4. We detected the
5 polymorphisms with amino acid changes (codons
1055, 1118, 1292, 1304, and 2502); these amino
acid changes did not cosegregate with FAP phenotype and another mutation that led to translational
termination was detected, respectively (data not
shown). Allelic frequencies of 4 common polymorphisms among the 150 individuals tested in the
present study are shown. These occurred at codon
486 destroying an RsaI site (0.43/0.57); at codon
545 (0.34/0.66); at codon 1493 creating a DsaI site
(0.3T0.65); and at codon 1678 creating an HgiAI
site (0.64/0.36). Allelic frequencies among the
other 16 polymorphisms were less than 0.03. This
information should be useful for presymptomatic
diagnosis of FAP, and for studies to examine tumors for loss of heterozygosity at the APC locus.

Location of Germ-Line Mutations Compared
With Phenotype of Patients

The germ-line mutations detected in 29 patients
for whom detailed information about clinical manifestations was available are summarized in Table
3. A t least one manifestation of Gardner’s syndrome (osteoma, epidermoid cyst, or desmoid tumor) (Gardner and Richards, 1953) was observed
in 17 of these patients; 12 had developed polyps in
the upper gastrointestinal tract or a thyroid tumor.

DISCUSSION

We presented here the result of a screening for
germ-line mutations of the entire coding region in
61 new FAP patients and summarized the germline mutations of the APC gene found in 97 of 150
unrelated FAP patients examined by an RNase
protection assay. The reason that mutations in
nearly one-third of the patients have not been
found could be explained by one or a few of the
followings: 1) some mismatches were not digested
by RNase (previous reports have suggested that
only 35-50% of mismatches are detected by the
RNase protection analysis; Myers et al., 1985; Lopez-Galindez et al., 1988); 2) the promoter region
of the APC gene was not examined; 3) sequences
in nonexamined introns may play a significant role
in expression of the APC gene; 4) another FAP

gene(s) may exist in the human genome. However, the fourth possibility is very unlikely because
genetic linkage studies have never indicated any
genetic heterogeneity. Although the MCC (mutated in colorectal carcinoma) gene, which is the
candidate for a tumor suppressor gene associated
with colorectal tumors, is physically very close to
the APC gene, we did not find any germ-line mutations in screening of nearly half of the MCC
coding region (Nishisho e t al., 1991).
Four interesting characteristics of the APC mutations were revealed by our screening in 150 FAP
patients. First, the great majority (90) of the 97
mutations detected so far would truncate the APC
product. Among them, more than 60% were
frameshifts due to 1- to 8-bp deletion or insertion.
This high proportionality of insertion and deletion
may be overestimated because an unknown number of single-base-pair mismatches may have been

protected from RNase digestion, whereas RNase
was able to cut the RNA probe easily when some
nucleotides were deleted in the DNAs tested.
Second, almost all the germ-line mutations
(97%) observed in the APC gene were located
within the 5’ half of the APC coding region. In
particular, more than 60% of the 97 mutations
were found between codons 1,000 and 1,600 in
exon 15, a region that accounts for only 20% of
the entire APC coding region (Fig. 2). Analysis of
the predicted structure of the APC protein reveals
2 potential coiled-coil structures, 1 of which is located in the central portion of the protein where
the mutations are clustered (Kinzler e t al., 1991b).
This region was also frequently mutated in sporadic
colorectal tumors and nearly 70% of somatic mutations detected were clustered (Miyoshi e t al.,

1992b).

Third, the mutations reported here did not appear to be correlated with clinical phenotypes in
FAP patients. Although FAP is frequently accompanied by extracolonic manifestations (Utsunomiya, 1989, 1990; Bussey, 1975; Buelow,
1987; Haggitt and Reid, 1986; Spigelman et al.,
1989; Gardner and Richards, 1953), observations
of variable phenotypes of patients within single
pedigrees have suggested that extracolonic manifestations are not regulated simply by the mutation
causing a large number of polyps in the colon and
rectum (Utsunomiya, 1989, 1990; Bussey, 1975;

reported previously that the number of adenomatous polyps seems to be associated with the location of germ-line mutations in FAP patients (Nagase et al., 1992).
Fourth, more than 80% of base substitutions in
the APC gene were from cytosine to other nucleotides, but only one-third of them occurred at the
CpG site. This result suggested that the mutation
from 5-methylcytosine to thymine caused by deamination seemed to be not so common although the
frequent targets of mutation in the retinoblastoma
and p53 genes were at the CpG site (Yandell et al.,
1989; Nigro et al., 1989). It is also interesting that
the cytosines o n the sense strand but not on the
antisense strand were the specific target for the
mutation; the mutations involving the G moiety
on the sense strand were very rare. The reason why
the cytosines on the sense strand of the APC gene
were preferentially mutated is unknown, but these
frequent mutations at the cytosines might be biased by the base specificity of the RNase protection
assay which could be more sensitive to the mismatch at cytosine than that at other nucleotides.
Further investigations will be needed to address
this question.
Furthermore, the 9 locations where mutation
was observed in more than 1 unrelated FAP patient might be useful for screening germ-line mutations or for presymptomatic diagnosis in FAP
families. As most of these mutations were observed

in patients of more than 2 nationalities, it is very
unlikely to be the founder effect. These 9 mutations, which together accounted for 45% of 97
families whose germ-line mutation was identified,
can be detected by gel electrophoresis of PCR
products, some with and some without enzyme digestion: deletions at 6 of these sites are detectable
as smaller PCR products and nonsense mutations
involving 3 recognition sites for restriction enzymes are detectable by the absence or presence of
smaller PCR products following digestion with appropriate enzymes (the nonsense mutations at
codons 232 and 302 affected the recognition sites
for SnaI and TaqI, respectively, and the mutation
in codon 625 created a recognition site for MaeI).
Together with our summary of polymorphisms observed in the APC gene, this information will be
very useful for presymptomatic diagnosis by linkage
analysis of members in FAP families, as well as for
investigations of loss of heterozygosity at the APC
locus in a variety of tumors. The data presented
here will also contribute to a greater understanding
of the mechanism(s) leading to development of
adenomatous polyps and will assist in the application of PCR-based screening and diagnostic methods for FAP patients.
