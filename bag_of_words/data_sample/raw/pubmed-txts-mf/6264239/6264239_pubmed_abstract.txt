The clinical aspects of a study of a large family suffering from glomus tumors are presented. A great deal of fragmentary information is obtained from the literature, but never before has so much information been obtained from one single family. The aim of this study was to screen the individual members of this family by careful history, with special interest taken in symptoms which could be indicative of glomus tumors, and by a physical examination. Because these tumors may be without symptoms or signs, the screening was extended with dynamic angioscintigraphy.
