Breast cancer in men is rare--among the risk factors that have been identified are a family history of breast cancer and evidence of androgen insufficiency. We report a family in which two brothers who both developed breast cancer had clinical and endocrinological evidence of androgen resistance. Sequence analysis revealed a mutation in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome, within the region encoding the DNA binding domain. This is the first report of a germline mutation in a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily associated with the development of cancer.
