Two recent reports have described inherited mutations in p53
associated with the predisposition to develop early cancers
(Malkin et al., 1990; Srivastava et al., 1990). These germ-line
mutations were found in affected members of families with
the Li-Fraumeni syndrome in which soft-tissue sarcomas in
related children were associated with cancers of the breast
and other organs among parents and relatives (Li & Fraumeni, 1969). In addition, a germ-line mutation in p53 has
been identified in a 5-year-old patients with an intra-cranial
malignancy and a strong family history of cancer (Metzger et
al., 1991). Finally, there are a further ten constitutional
mutations reported for the Li-Fraumeni syndrome in a
recently complied list of p53 mutations (Caron de Fromentel
& Soussi, 1991). We now report a germ-line mutation of p53
in a non-Li-Fraumeni cancer family.
We detected a constitutional mutation in p53 while using
the HOT technique (hydroxylamine/osmium tetroxide modification of mismatched basepairs (Cotton et al., 1988; Prosser
et al., 1990, 1991)) to screen for alterations in this gene in a
series of sporadic breast tumours. In one of these patients the
p53 mutation was present in both the tumour and white
blood cell DNA. This is an incidence of one in 136 patients,
or 0.7%. Sequencing confirmed that both normal and mutant
alleles were present in each sample. Interestingly, the tumour
DNA showed loss of heterozygosity with the probe YNZ22
but no loss with pBHp53. The mutation is in exon 8 at
codon 267 (Figure 1), changing arginine to glutamine, a basic
to an uncharged amino acid. The mutation lies in the general
region of previously published germ-line mutations in the p53
gene (amino acids 242-307, Malkin et al., 1990; Srivastava et
al., 1990; Metzger et al., 1991; Caron de Fromental & Soussi,
1991), although, unlike the majority of these mutations, it is
not found in the conserved regions of the gene (one in region
III, 13 in region IV and three in region V), but lies between
conserved regions IV and V at an arginine codon which is
invariant in all species studies (Xenopus, trout, chicken, rat,
mouse, human) (Soussi et al., 1989). The remaining codon at
position 307 does not lie within a conserved region of the
gene but is invariant in mammals. In data collated by Hollstein et al. (1991) which included 280 base substitutions
distributed over 90 codons of the p53 gene, codon 267 was
not reported mutated. In approximately 350 single base alterations in 93 codons collated by Caron de Fromentel and
Soussi (1991) codon 267 was once reported mutated from
CGG to CCG. The mutation we report is CGG to CAG.
Family studies and examination of medical records showed
that the patient is indeed a member of a cancer family, but a
family in which the age of onset of malignancy is not remarkably early (Figure 2). Information is available for a five
generation pedigree in which it would appear that the constitutive mutation was either present five generations ago or
arose as a germ-line mutation at that time. There are four
recorded cancer deaths in the pedigree: breast cancer at age

53, breast cancer at age 67, lung cancer at age 66, ovarian
cancer at age 63. The proband is alive with breast cancer at
age 53. We have found the mutation in the proband, in her
sister who is unaffected by cancer at age 37 years, and in a
first cousin of the mother of the proband who is alive and
unaffected by cancer at age 74 years. We have not been able
to PCR archival material from the mother's lung tissue
(which had been preserved in Bouin's fixative) and have
therefore been unable to show the mutation in this woman
who would appear to be an obligate carrier of the mutation.
Because the mutation is found in a 74 year old cancer-free
relative of the proband, it would be difficult to argue that the
mutation segregates with affected family members in the
pedigree, while being absent from unaffected relatives. What
we can say is that we have found a constitutive p53 mutation
in the proband of a cancer family in which a variety of
cancers have been noted over three generations. The mutation has been looked for and is present in two other family
members, neither of whom has developed cancer. There are
no cases of childhood or early cancer in this five generation
pedigree. No member affected by cancer had remarkably
early onset of the disease (at ages 42, 49, 53, 63 or 67 years),
and, indeed, one member of the pedigree with the mutation
remains unaffected in her 8th decade.
At the time of discovery of the Li-Fraumeni constitutive
mutations, the median age of tumour development in affected
family members was noted to be approximately 30 years and
it was argued that the mutations were, from the cell's point
of view, weak mutations (Vogelstein, 1990). Judging by the
observed age of onset of disease in affected family members
and by the absence of disease in a 74 year old carrier of the
mutation, the mutation at codon 267 in this family is even
weaker. It may be relevant to note that at least one parent
and one grandparent in the six families originally reported to
possess a constitutional p53 mutation were themselves
obligate carriers of the respective mutations but had not
developed cancer (Malkin et al., 1990).
It may be expected that mutations in p53 which are compatible with viability and normal early development must be
'weak' mutations which confer only a small growth advantage to the cell and which cannot act as dominant negative
mutations. On the other hand, no such constraint is imposed
on the somatically acquired mutations in tumours which
might be expected to show a greater variation and include

'strong' mutations conferring considerable growth advantage.
There is evidence (Milner & Medcalf, 1991) for the 'strength'
of only one of the constitutionally mutated codons, 248,
where a CGG-> TGG mutation does not behave in a
dominant-negative way when co-translated in vitro with wildtype p53 protein. This contrasts with the in vitro demonstration of the dominant-negative effect of proteins carrying
various other sporadic mutations. Milner and Medcalf also
looked at mutations at codon 273 (CGT->CCT and CGT>CTT) but did not investigate the particular recorded constitutional mutation at this site (CGT->CAG).
If we look at the overall frequency of total recorded
mutations in those codons of p53 found constitutionally
mutated (181, 242, 245, 248, 252, 258, 273, 282, 286, 307 and
now 267), it is apparent that four of the sites are hypermutable (codons 245, 248, 273 and 282) where mutations
account for approximately 25% of all those recorded in the
p53 gene, codon 248 accounting for greater than 10% on its
own (Caron de Fromentel & Soussi, 1991). Each of these
sites contains a CpG dinucleotide (245 contains half a CpG

dinucleotide) and 77% of the recorded mutations involve
C->T changes at the CpG configuration. Although there is
an under-representation of CpG dinucleotides in the vertebrate genome (Sved & Bird, 1990), it is known that 60-90%
of them are methylated (Bird, 1986) and it is generally
accepted that methylcytosine mutates at a high rate to
thymine (Coulondre et al., 1978). This type of spontaneous
mutation, which occurs at 12 times the normal transition
rate (Sved & Bird, 1990), is responsible for a high proportion
of all p53 mutation found at these four hypermutable
codons.
If we look only at the recorded constitutional mutations,
half (10/19) occur at the four frequently mutated codons and
nearly all of these (8/10) involve C->T mutations. Of the
remaining nine (at codons 181, 242, 252, 258, 267, 286 and
307), two involve C-> T changes at CpG dinucleotides.
Three are at sites so far unique to constitutional mutations
(181, 252) and the remaining six are at sites which are
infrequently mutated (242, 258, 267, 286 and 307) and where
the constitutional changes alone account for 53% of the
recorded mutations.
In summary, more than half (10/19) of all constitutional
p53 mutations appear to be spontaneous C->T changes at
CpG dinucleotides and are frequently found at hypermutable
sites (8/10). The codons of the remaining constitutional
mutations are only infrequently mutated and have no consistent mutational pattern. (Five are C->T [G->A] in nonCpG dinucleotides, two are T- > C [A-> G], one is A-> C
[T-> G], constituting seven transitions and one transversion,
and one is loss of a single base.) The particular changes at
the constitutional p53 mutations so far recorded are therefore
consistent with the conclusion that endogenous spontaneous
mutation could account for these events. The data are still
too sparse to discuss 'hotspots' for constitutional mutations,
but two codons (245 and 248) are responsible for eight of the
19 changes (42%). These are frequently mutated codons of
the p53 gene in any case and are responsible for about 13%
of all recorded mutations in the gene.
The authors would like to thank Mrs Rhona De Mey of the MRC
Human Genetics Unit registry for construction and verification of
the pedigree. Calculations of incidence of specific mutations in the
p53 gene used data from Caron de Fromentel and Soussi (1991).
