Summary
Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) often results from in-frame mutations of the dystrophin gene that allow
production of an altered but partially functional protein. To address potential structure-function relationships for the various domains of dystrophin, we examined both the dystrophin gene and protein in 68 patients
with abnormal dystrophin. Eighty-six percent of BMD patients with dystrophin of altered size have deletions
or duplications, and the observed sizes of dystrophin fit well with predictions based on DNA data. Deletions
within the amino-terminal domain I tended to result in low levels of dystrophin and a more severe phenotype.
The phenotypes of patients with deletions or duplications in the central rod domain were more variable. This
region can be divided into three portions based on differences in clinical presentations of patients. Deletions
around exons 4553 were most common and generally caused typical BMD; however, phenotypic variability
among patients with similar mutations suggests that epigenetic and/or environmental factors play an important
role in determining the clinical progression. In contrast, deletions or duplications in the proximal portion of
this domain tended to cause severe cramps and myalgia. Finally, loss of the middle of this region probably
causes a very mild phenotype, as only one such patient was found and his only symptom was elevated serum
creatine phosphokinase levels.

Introduction

Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD,
BMD) are allelic disorders caused by mutations of the
dystrophin gene (reviewed by Emery [1988] and Hoffman and Kunkel [1989]). DMD is characterized by
progressive muscle weakness with onset at 3-5 years
(Moser 1984). Proximal muscles are affected more
than distal ones, leading to loss of ambulation by 1012 years of age. Death, often due to respiratory inReceived August 6, 1990; final revision received February 19,

sufficiency, generally occurs in the third decade. In
contrast, BMD is much more heterogeneous in its clinical phenotype: patients generally remain ambulatory
into their twenties and some may continue walking
into their fifties or sixties (Ringel et al. 1977; Brooke
1986). Furthermore, while the pattern of muscle
involvement is often similar, the age of onset and rate
of progression is much more variable, and there have
been several reports of atypical presentations including severe muscle cramps and/or cardiomyopathy in
the absence of significant weakness (Kuhn et al. 1979;
Gospe et al. 1989; England et al. 1990).
DMD and BMD are caused by mutations in the
dystrophin gene (Koenig et al. 1987, 1989; Forrest et
al. 1988; Hu et al. 1988, 1990; Den Dunnen et al.
1989; Gillard et al. 1989) which encodes a large (427kD) cytoskeletal protein (Hammonds 1987; Hoffman
et al. 1987; Davidson and Critchley 1988; Koenig et

Dystrophin Genes and Proteins in BMD
al. 1988) localized to the inner face of the plasma
membrane of all types of myofibers (Arahata et al.
1988; Bonilla et al. 1988; Watkins et al. 1988;
Zubrzycka-Gaarn et al. 1988). At the protein level, it
was found that western blot analysis generally detected no dystrophin in muscle biopsies from patients
with DMD while dystrophin of altered size and/or
abundance was present in BMD muscle (Hoffman et
al. 1988; 1989b). Patients with very low levels of
dystrophin (<20%) often have an intermediate phenotype. Thus, the presence of partially functional dystrophin is sufficient to ameliorate the DMD phenotype, leading to the milder presentation seen in BMD.
Southern blot analysis of the dystrophin gene using
cDNA probes has shown that about 65% of DMD/
BMD patients have detectable deletions and another
5% have duplications (Koenig et al. 1987; Forrest et
al. 1988; Hu et al. 1988, 1990; Den Dunnen et al.
1989). The majority of deletions are clustered in the
distal rod domain (exons 45-53), with another cluster
at the amino terminus; however, the size and location
of these mutations are apparently not correlated with
the severity of the patient's disease (e.g., DMD vs.
BMD). To explain these observations, Monaco et al.
(1988) proposed the reading frame theory, which hypothesized that the absence of detectable dystrophin
in DMD is caused by mutations that disrupt the translational reading frame, leading to production of a
truncated and presumably unstable protein. Conversely, deletions or duplications causing BMD allow
production of internally deleted or duplicated proteins
because the translational reading frame is maintained.
Recent work has provided strong support for this hypothesis, as over 92% of deletions fit the reading frame
rule (Gillard et al. 1989; Koenig et al. 1989). Indeed,
most of the exceptions are clustered in one region at
the 5' end of the gene, where loss of exons 3-7 results
in BMD, DMD, or an intermediate phenotype (Malhotra et al. 1988; Koenig et al. 1989).
Here we have correlated DNA and protein data on
91 patients with muscular dystrophy. In hopes of shedding light on the molecular basis for the extreme variability seen among patients with BMD, we have concentrated our analysis on 68 patients with detectable
but abnormal dystrophin. This has also allowed us
to address the relationship between the structure and
function of dystrophin by correlating locations of mutations with protein levels and clinical presentation in
patients with BMD. We present evidence for general
differences in clinical presentation depending on
whether deletions remove the amino terminus, the

55

proximal portion of the rod domain, or the distal region, where many deletions are apparently clustered.
However, we also show that patients with similar inframe deletions and protein levels may have significantly different clinical progressions, suggesting that
epigenetic and environmental factors play a significant
role in determining the severity of a patient's disease.
Material and Methods
Patient Selection and Classification

Patients reported in this study are drawn from a
group of 101 males whose dystrophin genes and proteins were studied because of clinical evidence that
they might suffer from DMD or BMD. Of these, 91
individuals had detectable dystrophin abnormalities,
so our analysis is limited to these patients. Our sample
contains a preponderance of patients with BMD, owing to selection bias for patients with altered but detectable dystrophin. Of this patient sample, 28 were
ascertained in Tokyo, 14 each in Padua and in Boston,
and the remaining 35 were individual specimens submitted by 25 physicians from different parts of the
United States.
Clinical and molecular data are summarized in the
Appendix, and patient numbers used in the text refer
to table Al. Protein and/or DNA results have been
previously published for some of these patients as indicated in the Appendix. Clinical information was obtained from questionnaires filled out by the referring
physicians and/or by review of patient's medical
records. The clinical status of patients at various ages
was classified as follows: asymptomatic = elevated
serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and/or calf hypertrophy and/or cramps; mild = fatigue and/or any
detectable weakness including reports of "clumsiness," falling, abnormal gait, toe walking, and slow
running, all in the absence of a positive Gowers's sign;
moderate = positive Gowers's sign, difficulty with
stairs, and/or waddling gait; severe = inability to
rise without assistance and/or 3/5 strength in major
proximal muscle groups and/ or ambulation only with
effort and/or severe wasting of muscles; wheelchair
bound. All diagnoses mentioned in the text are based
on traditional clinical criteria in the absence of any
information from molecular studies on dystrophin or
its gene.

Immunofluorescence analysis for dystrophin was
accomplished with anti-DMDPI and anti-DMDPII as
described by Arahata et al. (1989), with antiDMDPIV (= monoclonal 4C5) as described by Arahata et al. (1991), and with anti-30-kD and anti-60kD as described by Hoffman et al. (1987) and Angelini
et al. (1990).

Relationships between Genetic Mutations and
Protein Structure
Patients with no dystrophin detectable by western blotting.

Diagnostic muscle biopsies were obtained from all
patients examined, and samples were prepared for
western blot analysis as described by Hoffman et al.
(1988). All patients were tested by immunoblots using
affinity purified anti-30-kD antibodies (raised against
a portion of domain II) (Hoffman et al. 1987). Quantitation was done as described elsewhere, using myosin
to correct for unequal loading (Hoffman et al. 1988,
1989b), and in practice varied by up to 20% on multiple blots. All western blot results were obtained prior
to DNA testing and were thus performed "blind" with
respect to knowledge of genetic defects.

Of 26 patients with no detectable dystrophin on
western blots probed with anti-30-kD antibodies, 23
had clinical diagnoses of DMD, and of these, 15
(65%) had deletions and two (9%) had duplications
(table 1). The other three patients included two with
diagnoses of BMD and one who was too young to
diagnose (nos. 10, 8, and 9; patient numbers refer to
designations in the Appendix). All three of these had
particularly large in-frame deletions (of exons 13-41,
10-42, and 10-44, respectively) encompassing the
region from which the 30-kD antigen was derived (the
protein and DNA analysis of patient 9 is shown in fig.
1). Since DNA analysis suggested that these patients
should be capable of producing some dystrophin,
indirect immunofluorescence using several regionspecific antisera was done. In each case, these patients
did indeed produce dystrophin, but it was detectable

dridge et al. (1984). Probes used included all the dystrophin cDNA probes described in Koenig et al.
(1987, 1989). PCR analysis was performed using the
multiplex primers described by Chamberlain et al.
(1988, 1990) supplemented by the multiplex assay of
Beggs et al. (1990). This PCR analysis is predicted to
identify deletions in all patients with BMD or intermediate phenotypes who have cDNA-detectable deletions (71 of 71 in Koenig et al. 1989) and in over 97%
of patients with DMD and cDNA-detectable deletions
(197 of 202 in Koenig et al. 1989). In some cases,
deletion boundaries were established using unpublished PCR primers that amplify exons 2, 5, and 7
(primer sequences available on request), as well as
primers for exons 16, 32, 34, 41, and 42 (Kunkel et
al., in press). Exon numbering follows the convention
established by Koenig et al. (1989).

only with antisera raised against the amino- and
carboxy-terminal portions of the molecule (fig. 2).
Thus they represent a group of patients that might be
misclassified if their diagnoses were based solely on
protein analysis by western blots using antisera that
recognize only portions of domain II.
Patients with reduced levels of normal-sized dystrophin.

-

Another interesting class of patients are those with
reduced levels of normal-sized dystrophin. The five
patients in this class fall into three groups based on
DNA findings. Two patients had DMD caused by
deletions that disrupted the reading frame by the loss
of several exons in domain II (nos. 47 and 53). In both
cases, less than 10% of normal levels of dystrophin
was present. We feel the most likely explanation for
these findings is that the deletion occurred during fetal
development and that these patients are somatic mosaics
(neither has any positive family history). Immunofiuorescence analysis looking for rare dystrophin-positive
fibers in one patient (no. 47) was inconclusive, as no
positive fibers were seen (data not shown).
On the other hand, one patient with mild BMD and
20% levels of dystrophin (no. 1) had a deletion of exon
1 containing the muscle promoter, but the upstream
brain promoter (Boyce et al. 1991) and exon 2 were
both intact. Thus, dystrophin production in his muscle is most likely due to transcription initiating from
the upstream brain promoter. The phenotypic differences between these patients (nos. 47 and 53 are clini-

cally considered to have DMD, see Appendix) may be
due to the relative levels of protein (e.g., <10% vs.
"-20%) and/or to the fact that expression in the mosaics may be very patchy and uneven while all myofibers
in the patient with a promoter deletion should express
low but equal levels of dystrophin. By analogy to patient 1, we suspect that the remaining two patients
with reduced dystrophin levels and no detectable mutations (nos. 67 and 68) are likely to also have promoter mutations although we can not rule out the
possibility that their mutations affect mRNA or protein stability.
Patients with abnormral-sized dystrophin.-Sixty patients
(all unrelated except two pairs of brothers) had dystrophin of altered size and clinical diagnoses of either
BMD, intermediate, or undeterminate status (table 1).
Of the 58 unrelated cases, 79% of these patients had
deletions and another 7% had duplications, suggesting that the frequency of large structural mutations in BMD is higher than the estimate of "-65% for
DMD (Koenig et al. 1987; Forrest et al. 1988; Hu et
al. 1988; Den Dunnen et al. 1989; Gillard et al. 1989).
As might be expected, all five patients with larger proteins had detectable gene duplications and all of these
were in-frame. Of the 46 different deletions, 45 had
known effects on the reading frame, and of these, 40
were in-frame. Of the five exceptions, three (nos. 4,
5, and 6) were deletions of exons 3-7, as previously
reported by Malhotra et al. (1988). The other two

(20-year-old male with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy) (panels D-F) using region-specific anti-dystrophin antisera. Anti-DMDP II (panels
B and E), raised against part of exons 11-12 in the central rod domain, did not detect any dystrophin in patient 9, yet both anti-DMDP
I (panels A and D) and anti-DMDP IV (panels C and F), raised against the amino and carboxy termini, respectively, detected dystrophin
in a variable and patchy pattern characteristic of BMD (Arahata et al. 1989).

(nos. 13 and 52) both have small deletions of one or
two exons in domain II (exons 42-43 and 51, respectively). All five had low levels of protein (5%-20%)
consistent with their clinical histories, which were suggestive of either DMD or severe BMD. If either of the
neighboring exons 5' and 3' of each of these deletions
was also removed (e.g., by alternative splicing), then
the reading frame would be restored, allowing production of an internally deleted protein (Chelly et al.
1990). Our findings of very low levels of slightly
smaller proteins support this hypothesis and argue
against the possibilities that the patients are mosaic or
that a truncated peptide missing the carboxy terminus
is being produced.
In general, the sizes of all the abnormal proteins
correlated well with predictions based on sequence

analysis of the exons that were deleted or duplicated
(table 2). Size estimates of altered proteins were usually made at different times on different gels, yet patients with similar deletions were found to have
similar-sized proteins and patients with larger deletions generally had smaller proteins (table 2). However, one patient (no. 48) illustrates the limits of detection for our western blot analysis, as he was initially
classified as having normal-sized dystrophin. Following the discovery of an exon 48 deletion (predicted to
remove 60 of 3,685 amino acids), the western blot
was revaluated and a small size difference was noted.
All five patients with internal deletions in domain I
had very low levels of dystrophin regardless of reading
frame status (10%-15% of normal) (table 2, fig. 3,
Appendix). Although generally higher, protein levels

among patients with deletions in the distal portion of
domain II were much more variable (e.g., 20%-100%
for deletion of exons 45-48). This may reflect variability in locations of deletion breakpoints relative to intron/exon junctions or alternatively may be due to
epigenetic differences that affect the stability of the
deleted proteins. While all the patients with domain I
deletions had low protein levels and early onsets (before 10 years of age), there was no apparent correlation between protein levels and phenotypic severity
among the group with deletions in domain II. Finally,
for domain II deletions, protein levels were also not
related to the number of triple alpha-helical repeat
units deleted (e.g., deletions of exons 45-47, 45-48,
45-49, and 45-53 remove 11/2, 2, 21/2, and 4 repeats
respectively) (Koenig and Kunkel 1990).
Correlations between Molecular Data and Clinical
Presentation in Patients with BMD

To determine whether alterations of specific regions
of dystrophin are related to any particular aspects of
the BMD phenotype, we correlated our molecular
data with available information on the patient's phenotypes. Some clinical histories did not specify

whether a patient had a particular symptom or not,
probably because they did not have it, but for the
sake of accuracy, we enumerate only those for whom
specific information was available. For this analysis,
we limited ourselves to patients with detectable (but
abnormal-sized) dystrophin and completely defined
deletions or duplications (fig. 3, Appendix). Furthermore, we excluded patients with frame-shifting deletions that caused production of very low levels of
dystrophin. Among the remaining 50 patients, representing 48 independent mutations, all had elevated
serum CPK levels, 36 of 40 had calf hypertrophy, two
of 35 were considered mentally retarded (IQs were not
determined), one of 35 carried a diagnosis of attention
deficit disorder, and two of 35 were diagnosed as having schizophrenia. One of 21 patients reported gastrointestinal pain and two of 39 had a severe cardiomyopathy including one (no. 46) who presented at 15 years
of age with cardiac failure and no neuromuscular
symptoms other than calf hypertrophy. Finally, 36 of
37 had myopathic electromyograms, with one patient
having mixed myopathic and neuropathic findings.
While the low incidence of most of these findings
makes analysis difficult, none of these phenotypes cor-

related with either protein levels or the location and
size of deletions or duplications.
The initial clinical presentation of patients with
BMD can be quite variable. In our sample, 31 patients
presented with weakness or difficulty walking or running. The remaining patients presented with cramps
and/or myalgia (eight), elevated serum enzymes
(four), developmental delay (two), myoglobinuria
(two), calf hypertrophy (one), growth delay (one), and
cardiac distress (one). The incidence of cramps and
myalgia is interesting in light of a recent report by
Gospe et al. (1989) describing a family with X-linked
cramps and myalgia, no weakness, and a dystrophin
gene deletion of exons 10-22. Fourteen of our patients
reported muscle pain that was recorded in their clinical
records (fig. 3). In most cases, cramps were induced
by exercise and/or exposure to cold, but, unlike the
family reported by Gospe et al. (1989), all our patients
also had clinical weakness (except no. 12, discussed
below). Of note is the observation that six of these
patients all have deletions or duplications in the proximal rod domain (defined here as exons 10-44) where
Gospe's family was deleted (Gospe et al. 1989). In two
of these patients (nos. 10 and 11) the muscle pains
were quite striking and were recorded as the patient's

chief complaint. In three more (no. 56 and the brothers
57 and 58), calf pain after running was the presenting
complaint. There are two other patients with mutations in this region and no myalgias (nos. 8 and 9), but
the deletions in these latter two are the largest we have
found. Unlike the patients reporting myalgias, patient
8 is more severely affected (e.g., wheelchair bound at
age 21 years), while patient 9 is too young to draw any
conclusions from. Of the other 8 patients reporting
muscle pain, one was deleted for the muscle promoter
(of six mutations in domain I) and the other seven (of
37) all have deletions in the commonly deleted region
of the distal rod domain (defined as exons 45-52).
In four of these patients, myalgias were one of their
presenting symptoms, but none were as severe as those
experienced by patients 10 and 11.
One patient with a deletion of exons 35-44 (no. 12)
was particularly noteworthy because he is the only
BMD patient we have ever identified with an in-frame
deletion in this region (Koenig et al. 1989). The preponderance of exons with similar borders in the region
of exons 33-45 predicts that most deletions should be
in-frame, resulting in BMD. The lack of such patients
in our previous analyses (Koenig et al. 1989) suggests
that there is a bias of ascertainment such that in-frame
deletions in this region do not cause patients to be seen
in neuromuscular clinics. The phenotype of patient 12
supports this hypothesis, as this 11-year-old male was
accidentally ascertained with elevated serum CPK levels (37,800 and 162,000 U/l) following minor surgery. His only neuromuscular symptoms are occasional mild cramps after playing soccer or mountain
climbing, but it should be noted that muscle histology
revealed mild variation in fiber size and scattered regenerating fibers suggestive of preclinical muscular
dystrophy.
As noted earlier, patients with deletions in domain I
all had low levels of protein and relatively early onsets.
Their progressions were also more severe, as those
over 10 years of age all had moderate severities (i.e.,
positive Gowers's sign) while patients with deletions
in domain II were often in their twenties before reaching this stage (see Appendix).
Perhaps the most intriguing observation is the clinical variability exhibited by patients with similar deletions and protein levels. Of 11 patients with deletions
of exons 45-47, most have a fairly slow progression
(four are 28-42 years old and still walking) and two
even carry diagnoses of quadriceps myopathy (nos.
15, 26) (Sunohara et al. 1990) due to limited distribution of weakness. On the other hand, one (no. 22)

Dystrophin Genes and Proteins in BMD

has severe trouble with stairs at 17 and another (no.
27), although only 4 years old, has gross motor deficits
and is clinically classified as indeterminate between
DMD and BMD. Similar contrasts can be found
among patients with deletions of exons 45-48, 4549, and 45-53. That this variability is not correlated
with protein levels (see Appendix) suggests that it is
not caused by differences in proximity of deletion
breakpoints to splice junctions which might affect
splicing efficiency. Rather, the differences appear to be
caused by environmental and/or epigenetic factors.
Discussion

Traditional structure-function analyses of proteins
often involve deleting specific portions of a molecular
and then assessing its stability and function in vivo
and in vitro. In the case of dystrophin, an imperfect
analogy can be drawn to patients with BMD and DMD
who have internal deletions and duplications in their
dystrophin genes. Earlier studies suggested that domain III and part of domain IV were essential to dystrophin stability (Koenig et al. 1989). This was based
on the observation that patients with either small
frame-shifting deletions at the very 3' end of domain
II (e.g., around exons 58-60) or terminal deletions of
domains III and IV had DMD, while a patient with
terminal deletion of just the 3' half of domain IV had
BMD (Darras and Francke 1988; McCabe et al.
1989). This was also supported by the finding that the
carboxy terminus was always present in patients with
BMD but not in those with DMD (Arahata et al.
1991).
In the present study, we have extended these observations with particular emphasis on trying to understand the basis for the phenotypic variability seen
among patients with BMD. Unfortunately, the intragroup variation among patients with similar deletions
is so great that it is difficult to draw firm conclusions
based on intergroup variation. Our analysis was also
hampered by the young ages of many patients, owing
to the fact that most were ascertained through pediatric neuromuscular clinics. Nevertheless, several general observations can be made. The majority of inframe deletions (37 of 46) were in the commonly
deleted region in the distal portion of domain II. One
apparent exception to the reading frame rule is a patient with a clinical diagnosis of DMD, in-frame deletion of exons 45-46, and barely detectable dystrophin
(no. 14). Our previous report (Koenig et al. 1989)

61

identified one other such patient with a deletion of
exons 45-46 and a diagnosis of DMD, suggesting that
this is a reproducible finding. Further studies on
mRNA splicing may be needed to explain this apparent contradiction. Although the other patients with
deletions in this region (e.g., exons 45-33) exhibited
variable phenotypes, in general, they had "classical
BMD," often remaining ambulatory well past their
twenties. In contrast, patients with mutations in domain I tended to be more severely affected and were
often classified as severe BMD or intermediate. For
those with deletions of exons 3-7, this is probably a
consequence of inefficient correction of the frame shift
resulting in low protein levels. Three other patients,
had in-frame deletions, including one who was missing only exon 3, yet all of these also had low protein
levels. This suggests that the normal structure of this
domain is important for dystrophin's stability and,
hence, the severity of a patient's disease. If, by analogy
to alpha-actinin (Hammonds 1987) this region binds
actin or some related protein, then we might speculate
that proper function of this protein binding domain is
important for dystrophin stability and function.
While occasional muscle pain is not uncommon
among patients with muscular dystrophy (Emery
1988), it is unusual for this to be the patient's chief
complaint (Kuhn et al. 1979). The high incidence of
severe cramps and myalgia among patients with deletions and duplications in the proximal rod domain
suggests that this region is functionally different from
the distal portion of the rod. Six of eight patients
(75%) with in-frame mutations in this region had
cramps, while only eight of 43 (19%) patients with
mutations in other parts of the gene had these symptoms (P < .01 by X2 test for independence). Since both
deletions and duplications caused cramps, we conclude that disruption, without loss, of this region is
sufficient to cause these symptoms. These results imply
that the 24 repeat units in the rod domain are not
functionally equivalent to each other. Further evidence for this comes from the observation of a dearth
of BMD patients with in-frame deletions in the central
rod domain (exons 33-45) (present study; Koenig et
al. 1989). The one deletion we have found is in an
essentially asymptomatic patient with elevated serum
CPK levels, suggesting that loss of this region results
in a relatively mild phenotype. Currently, we are very
interested in studying other individuals with idiopathic hyper-CPKemia in hopes of extending these observations. In the future, clinicians will have to consider dystrophin abnormalities in the differential

Figure 4
Molecular-clinical correlations at dystrophin gene.
The same schematic of the dystrophin molecule used in fig. 3 illustrates regions which, if lost or disrupted by in-frame mutations,
cause varying degrees of muscular dystrophy. Very large deletions
within a particular region may have a more severe phenotype. The
existence of a putative "asymptomatic" region with elevated serum
CPK levels as the primary symptom is based on the observation that
only one patient with an in-frame deletion in this region has been
found. The DMD region centered on domain III is based on the
observation that frame-shifting mutations anywhere before this region result in DMD while loss of just the carboxy terminus causes
BMD. It should be kept in mind that this figure represents a generalization that is useful for dividing the protein into functionally distinct regions; however, it is not possible to make diagnostic predictions for individual patients, since many factors might influence the
clinical progression.

diagnosis of patients with mild or atypical presentations.

Figure 4 summarizes the general trends (but not
ironclad rules) apparent from the present and previous
studies. If, by analogy to alpha-actinin, domain I binds
to actin (Hammonds 1987), then deletion of this region might be expected to reduce protein stability by
disrupting interactions with other components of the
membrane cytoskeleton. This would be reflected in
the generally lower protein levels and, hence, more
severe progression we see in these patients. In contrast,
one (simplistic) view of the central rod domain holds
that this extended rod of 24 repeats (Davison and
Critchley 1988; Koenig and Kunkel 1990) merely provides size for the molecule, so internal deletions would
be predicted to have minimal effects on protein function. This may be partly true, as extremely large deletions (e.g., in patients 8 and 10 in this report and in a
patient described by England et al. [1990]) and duplications (Angelini et al. 1990) result in BMD and not
DMD. Our data, however, suggest that this region is
not completely homogenous with respect to function,
since deletions in three different regions (proximal,
central, and distal) of this domain cause generally different phenotypes (i.e., severe cramps, elevated CPK,
and classical BMD, respectively). A possible molecular explanation for this might be that dystrophin binds
and/or interacts with some other protein(s) at certain

positions along the rod domain, and there is precedent
for this in the spectrins which bind other proteins
along their rod domain (reviewed in Morrow 1989).
Domain III and the proximal half of domain IV are
apparently essential, since patients with small frameshifting deletions that result in the loss of only these
domains invariably have DMD (Koenig et al. 1989)
and no detectable dystrophin (Arahata et al. 1991).
Finally, the loss of just the most terminal portion of
domain IV is associated with a mild, nonprogressive, BMD, indicating that this region is not essential
to dystrophin function (Darras and Francke 1988;
McCabe et al. 1989).
Several of our cases illustrate the importance of correlating both protein and DNA findings when conducting a molecular analysis for DMD and BMD. Patient 48 had a deletion that removed only 60 of 3,685
amino acids, and his dystrophin was initially classified
as normal in size. Similarly, patients 8, 9, and 10
would have been reported as having no dystrophin
except for the fact that DNA analysis revealed large
deletions encompassing the epitopes to which the antibodies were raised. Therefore, we consider it important to obtain both DNA and protein studies when
evaluating new cases of muscular dystrophy, especially if only one antiserum is used for protein studies.
Correlating DNA and protein data has also allowed
us to infer something about the mutations in patients
with no detectable deletions or duplications. Alterations in the levels, but not the size, of dystrophin are
likely to be caused by promoter mutations or, perhaps,
mutations that affect mRNA or protein stability. In
contrast, patients with dystrophin of altered size are
likely to suffer from mutations that affect mRNA splicing. Since an intact carboxy terminus seems essential
for protein stability (Koenig et al. 1989; Arahata et al.
1991), we predict that BMD patients are not likely
to have point mutations that create premature stop
codons. On the other hand, both nonsense and splicing mutations could prevent protein production in patients with DMD, and this might account for the
greater proportion of nondeletion/duplication mutations in this population (e.g., v30%O for DMD vs.
rv14% for BMD).
DMD and BMD represent different degrees of severity for what is essentially the same disease. Understanding the basis for these extremely variable presentations and progressions is important for elucidating
the causes of weakness and formulating strategies to
minimize or eliminate the symptoms of this disease.
The present study demonstrates that much of the clini-

63

Dystrophin Genes and Proteins in BMD

cal variability among patients with BMD cannot be
accounted for by specific mutations at the DNA level.
Indeed, significant variability exists even among family members with the same mutation (e.g., patients
34 and 37). Future studies on multigeneration BMD
families and BMD twins are needed to further document this. However, one might suppose that genetic
variation at loci encoding proteins that interact with
dystrophin is responsible for some of this variability.
With the recent identification of a dystrophin-associated glycoprotein (Campbell and Kahl 1989) these experiments should soon become feasible.
