ABSTRACT
Iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) cDNA from fibroblasts of nine
patients with Hunter syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type
II) was screened for mutations using single strand
conformation polymorphism analysis. Direct sequencing
revealed a number of different mutations including missense
or nonsense point mutations, deletions of one, two, or 60 base
pairs, and a 22 base pair-insertion. Mutations of these types
probably account for most IDS gene defects as only about
20% of Hunter patients have a complete deletion or gross
structural alteration of their IDS gene. Thus the broad clinical
variability amongst the Hunter patients may be due to the
extensive genetic heterogeneity seen. Tbe relationship between
genotype and clinical phenotype is analysed in 12 Hunter
patients.
INTRODUCTION
Iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS, EC 3.1.6.13.) is a lysosomal enzyme
involved in glycosaminoglycan degradation. IDS hydrolyses
terminal iduronate-2-sulfate esters in heparan and dermatan
sulfate. IDS deficiency (mucopolysaccharidosis type II, Hunter
syndrome), an X-chromosomal recessive disorder, results in
accumulation of heparan and dermatan sulfate in various tissues.
Among the patients with Hunter syndrome, there is a broad
spectrum of clinical phenotypes1. In the mildest form, patients
are mentally normal and show only minimal symptoms of the
disease. Whereas, severely affected children present with typical
clinical features including skeletal dysmorphisms, stiff joints,
hepatosplenomegaly, cardiovascular insuffiency, and mental
retardation. It has been suggested that the different clinical
phenotypes are due to different mutations of the IDS gene2.
IDS has been purified from human tissues to homogeneity3
and a cDN A clone containing the entire coding region of the IDS
gene has been isolated2. Using this cDNA as a molecular probe,
genomic DNA of a total of 109 patients with Hunter syndrome
has been investigated so far2-4"11. About 8% of the patients
show a complete deletion and about 12% reveal gross structural
aberrations of the gene. Thus, the majority of patients with Hunter
disease has no apparent alteration in the IDS restriction pattern

in routine Southern analysis of genomic DNA suggesting the
existence of smaller rearrangements. The nature and regional
distribution of these mutations have yet to be determined. Such
an analysis is of primary importance for studying the correlation
between genotype and phenotype. Here we report the spectrum
of mutations in the IDS gene of 12 patients with Hunter
syndrome.
RESULTS
We performed molecular studies to identify the primary genetic
defect on a total of 28 patients with Hunter syndrome. As a first
screening, Southern hybridization was carried out using the IDS
cDNA probe and genomic DNA of the patients digested by
HindHJ, StuI, TaqI, or Pstl. In three cases a complete deletion
of the IDS gene was suggested by the absence of any hybridizing
fragments (see Table I and ref. 6). In all patients with a complete
deletion of the IDS gene, the locus DXS466 was also absent (data
not shown) providing indirect support to our assumption that
DXS466 maps within an intron of the IDS gene (manuscript in
preparation and ref. 8).
In five other patients an altered pattern was seen after Southern
hybridization with one or more of the regular bands being absent
and/or replaced by one or more fragments of differing size that
were not observed in controls (in part unpublished)12. These
changes in the restriction pattern could only be demonstrated
following digestion of the genomic DNA with one (HindHI and
TaqI in one and three cases, respectively) of the four enzymes
used, and therefore these findings suggest that the rearrangements
of the IDS gene must be relatively small or just affect a single
restriction site.
Under the experimental conditions used, in the remaining 20
cases, the Southern pattern was similar to that seen for controls.
Of these 20, eight were chosen for a subsequent thorough
molecular analysis. In addition, patient H20, who presented with
an altered TaqI Southern-pattern (Fig. 1. and see below for more
detail), was also included in this study.
In all nine patients investigated here, three overlapping
fragments (Nos. 1, 2, and 3) containing the entire coding

Patients are ordered from mild (top) to severe (bottom) clinical phenotype with the first patient having a very mild, the second and third a mild, the next four an
intermediate, and the last four a severe form. As clinical data were unavailable on patient H15, his position in the Table has been chosen solely according to the
expected alteration of the protein. Molecular and clinical data of patient C.S. have already been reported.8

sequence of IDS (Fig. 2) could be amplified by PCR after reverse
transcription of RNA isolated from skin fibroblasts. In six cases,
the size of these fragments was indistinguishable from that of
controls. However, in two patients (H10 and H12) both fragments
2 and 3 were smaller and in a third one (HI8) they were larger
than expected (not shown) suggesting, respectively, deletions and
an insertion in the overlapping region of fragments 2 and 3. Direct
sequencing of PCR products revealed the absence of the same
60 base pairs (bp) in the IDS cDNA from both patients H10 and
H12, not related to each other by the best of our knowledge,
leading to an in frame-loss of codons 375-to-394 (Fig. 4G).
Patient H18 presents with a 22 base pair-insertion between codons
335 and 336 (Fig. 4H) resulting in a reading frame shift and the
incorporation of 12 altered amino acids before a frame-stop
codon. The origin of the inserted sequence is not yet known.
For the six patients with PCR fragments of apparently identical
size as the ones from controls, single strand conformation
polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was performed. The single strand
pattern of fragment 1.2 in patient H8 shows clear mobility shifts
(Fig. 3A, lane 2) when compared to controls. Direct sequencing
revealed a missense mutation in codon 135 (Fig. 4A), and,
additionally, a silent point mutation at codon 146 (ACC-ACT,
not shown). The same silent mutation was found in patient H15
(sequencing data not shown). In addition, patient H15 also had
a one base pair-deletion in codon 438 (lane l j n Fig. 3B, and
Fig. 4E). In patient H21, prominent band shifts were seen (Figs.
3B and C) both for fragments 3.1 and 2 (PvuII 3'-subfragment).
Direct sequencing identified a missense mutation in codon 422
(Fig. 4B). Patient H13 showed a shift for fragment 1.2 (Fig. 3A,
lane 4) due to a two bp-deletion in codon 170 (Fig. 4F). Altered
SSCP bands were observed for fragment 3.1 in both H17 and
H20 (lanes 2 and 4 in Fig. 3B) due to point mutations in codons
475 and 443 (Figs. 4D and C), respectively.
In most of the nine patients reported, the mutations described
were predicted to result in gains or losses of restriction enzyme
recognition sites in PCR products. For example, in patients H8
and H21 restriction sites for Hinfl and Haein, respectively, were
formed (data not shown). As the restriction map of the IDS gene

is not yet known, no information is available on the changes of
the restriction pattern of the genomic DNA introduced by the
mutations. Nevertheless, the point mutations in patients H13 and
H17, that led to the loss of an Nspl and EcoRI restriction site,
respectively, could be detected in genomic Southern blots (not
shown). Also the point mutation in patient H20, that destroyed
a TaqI cutting site, altered grossly the hybridization pattern of
the TaqI digested genomic DNA (Fig. 1). In patients H10 and
H12, several restriction sites (e.g. Hindin, Bgll, or TaqI) were
removed from the cDNA by the absence of 60 bp. However,
no alterations were seen in the Southern pattern of these two
patients after digestion of genomic DNA by the respective
enzymes (results not shown). This observation suggested that
different molecular mechanisms than 'simple' deletions could be
the primary cause of the disease in these probands (see also
Discussion).

All mutations described above are placed on the cDNA in
Fig. 2, while Table I gives an overview on the IDS mutations
and the associated clinical phenotypes of a total of 12 patients
(9 patients presented in this communication and 3 with complete
gene deletions detected in our laboratory).

DISCUSSION
We studied a total of 28 Hunter syndrome patients. Five patients
had greatly differing Southern blot hybridization patterns with
the IDS cDNA indicating gross structural rearrangements of the
gene. This figure is similar to the frequency found by
others2-4-5'79"". 20 patients had similar genomic IDS fragments
to the control pattern suggestive of smaller rearrangements.
Cultured fibroblasts, from which RNA could easily be isolated
and IDS cDNA amplified for further molecular studies, were
available from nine of these patients. Direct sequencing of these
PCR products revealed a wide spectrum of mutations including
missense and nonsense point mutations, minor deletions, and a
22 bp-insertion of unknown origin. As cell lines were not
available from 15 patients and as the DNA sequence of the IDS
gene is not yet known, the molecular nature of these mutations
could not be determined. A C-to-T transition of the third
nucleotide in codon 146, that does not change the amino acid
sequence, was identified in two patients. The same sequence
alteration has also been found by a British group" suggesting
that it represents a common polymorphism.
It seems that mutations are more frequent in a 500 bp-region
of the 3'-half and in the 5'-one third of the cDNA. Nevertheless,
further studies and the identification of additional mutations are
necessary to decide whether or not these parts of the IDS gene
represent real mutation 'hot spots' as it has been shown for some
X-chromosomal genes (for review see ref. 13).
Consistent with the wide spectrum of mutations, a broad
variation in clinical phenotypes was reported. Although being

mutations found with the clinical phenotypes, it may be possible
to pinpoint regions of the protein that are important for its
function. Indeed, there is a striking difference between the
phenotype of patients H21 (Cys^22-Gly) and H8 (Lys-135-Arg),

each with a single altered amino acid in the otherwise complete
IDS. Patient H21 is very mildly affected with normal intelligence.
Whereas patient H8 presents with the classical Hunter syndrome
phenotype including mental retardation. To speculate, it would

Human Molecular Genetics, Vol. 1, No. 5 339
appear that 422-Cys is functionally less essential than 135-Lys.
Indeed, lysine at position 135 is completely conserved among
the seven different sulfatases analysed until now although they
share only about 30% of overall homology2-14. Nevertheless, it
can not be completely ruled out that patient H8 also has a second
IDS mutation somewhere else that has been missed by SSCP and
that is responsible for or contributing to the severe phenotype
observed. Also the two unrelated patients with an identical 60
bp-deletion are only mildly affected suggesting that the stability
and function of the truncated protein is less disturbed than in
patients with frame shifts or nonsense mutations which lead to
premature chain termination. The molecular nature of the
mutation leading to the absence of 60 bp in the mRNA of patients
H10 and H12 is not yet known. Flomen et al. described a patient
with loss of the same 60 bp". That patient showed a point
mutation in the IDS coding sequence creating a novel donor splice
site that was preferentially utilized and resulted in loss of a part
of one exon in the mRNA. Most likely, patients H10 and H12
have similar splice mutations, too. Also the 22 bp-insertion seen
in patient HI8 could result from aberrant splicing.
Obviously, as it was possible to specifically amplify the IDS
coding sequence from RNA, the IDS gene was transcribed in
the nine patients reported. Whether or not the RNA is translated
in vivo and the resulting protein is stable, remains to be
investigated. In standard diagnostic assays all of these patients
had no detectable IDS enzyme activity. However, in the light
of the great differences in the clinical course of the disease, a
considerable variation may exist in the in vivo activity and/or
stability of the enzyme. Therefore, careful additional
investigations of mutant enzyme function are necessary to get
a better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation in
this disease.
In conclusion, our results indicate that differences in the clinical
phenotypes of patients with IDS defect may be explained by
different mutations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
RNA preparation
Total RNA from cultured skin fibroblasts was prepared essentially as described14.
Cells were lysed directly in the tissue culture flasks (28 cm2) by adding 0.7 ml
of 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate pH 7, 0.5% sarcosyl,
and 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol The lysate was pressed twice through a 25G needle
to homogenize it. Following phenol/chloroform extraction and addition of 10%
(v/v) 2 M sodium acetate pH 4, the supernatant was precipitated with isopropanol
and the RNA dissolved in water.
Reverse transcription of RNA
About 5 fig of total RNA was transcribed into the first strand of cDNA in 100
fi\ reaction volume containing PCR buffer (see below), 100 jtM dNTPs, 5 /ig
random hexamers, 80 U human placenta ribonuclease inhibitor, and 200 U
Superscript Reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) for 60 min at 37 °C. In
addition, for each fragment of interest (see Results), first strand cDNA synthesis
and PCR amplification were carted out by using 0 08 pM of the respective specific
IDS primers (see below).
Amplification of IDS coding sequences
The total coding sequence of IDS cDNA was amplified with three sets of primers
resulting in overlapping fragments Nos. 1-3 (Fig. 2). For SSCP, fragment 1
wassubdived into two fragments (1.1 and 1.2). Fragment 3.1 represents the 5'-two
third of fragment 3. Primer sequences were as follows: Fragment 1: TAACTGCGCCACCTGCTGCA (5') and CCAGGAAGAAAGGACTGGCTGAC
(3'), fragment 1.1: GGTCACATAGCCATTCTCCTTGAA (3'), fragment 1.2:
GCCTCCTCTTCCAGAATGCCTTTG (5'); Fragment 2: GAACTCCATGCCAACCTGC (5') and GAAATGAAGGAACGGGGC (3'); Fragment 3: GGCCAACAGCACCATCAT (5') and GAGCACATCACATTTGCC (3'), fragment
3.1: CCTATAGTCTATGGTGCGTATGGA (3').

on 17 August 2018

PCR reactions were carried out in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 1,5 mM MgCl2,
50 mM KC1, 0,001 % gelatine, 0,2 mM dNTPs, and 0,4 pM of each primer.
About 10% of the reverse transcription reaction and 1 U Taq Polymerase (Life
Technologies) were used for a 100 /jl PCR. For the amplification of fragment
1, 10% DMSO was included in the reaction mixture. 35 cycles (45 sec 94°C,
45 sec at 58°C, and 2 min at 72°C) were carried out for fragment 1, and 30
cycles (45 sec at 94°C, 45 sec at 53°C, and 2 min at 72°Q for fragments 2 and 3.
SSCP analysis
About 5 fi\ PCR product was mixed with formamide dye (95% formamide, 20
mM EDTA, 0.05% Bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol FF), heated
to 94°C for 4 min, quickly cooled on ice and immediately loaded onto 6%
acrylamide gels containing 1 xTBE and 10% glycerol. Fragments 1.1, 1.2, and
3.1 were directly analysed, while fragment 2 was cut with PvuII, and fragment
3 with BamHI before denaturation. Gels were run overnight at 30 W and DNA
fragments were detected after silver staining (by a Bio-Rad kit).
Direct sequencing of PCR products
Double stranded PCR products were separated on agarose gels and eluted. Using
an aliquot, a second asymmetric PCR was performed essentially using the same
conditions as the first PCR except that the annealing temperature was 2°C higher,
the cycle number was increased to 40, and one of the primers was diluted to
150. Usually, this primer was taken for the sequencing reaction, although in
some instances internal pnmers were used. Single stranded PCR products were
cleaned with centncon 100 microconcentrators (Amicon). About 20 p.\ from the
asymmetric PCR reaction mixture was used for a sequencing reaction performed
by the chain termination method (Sequenase 2.0, USB) after ^S-dATP labelling.
