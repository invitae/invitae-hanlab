Received October 7, 1994; Revised and Accepted December 13, 1994

Mutations causing mucopolysaccharidosis IVA in 15 Japanese and one Caucasian patient were characterized.
To screen these mutations, we used a combination of single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and
heteroduplex analysis for PCR products of targeted cDNA or genomic DNA. Various small mutations were
identified in 23 of 26 alleles, while the other six alleles had large rearrangements. Cycle sequencing of PCR
products revealed 15 different mutations, including 12 missense, one nonsense, one frame shift (2 bp deletion)
and one splice site mutation, in accord with the broad range of clinical phenotypes. Two alleles have different
mutations in the same nucleotide position of exon 3 (R94C, CGC->TGC; R94G, CGC->GGC), diagnosed by
sequencing and by allelic-specific oligohybridization (ASO). One allele had two amino acid changes, E450V
in exon 12 and V488M in exon 13, thereby indicating a double point mutation. All 16 mutations reported were
confirmed by restriction enzyme assay or by allelic-specific oligohybridization. Transfection of mutagenized
cDNAs into patients' fibrobiasts showed that all mutations caused completely deficient or markedly decreased
N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (GALNS) activity, thereby indicating that these mutations were
responsible for the enzyme deficiency.

INTRODUCTION
N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (GALNS, E.C.3.1.6.4)
is a lysosomal enzyme related to glycosaminoglycan degradation. GALNS, also known as galactose-6-sulfate sulfatase
(\-4), hydrolyzes the sulfate ester group of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate at the nonreducing end of chondroitin-6-sulfate,
and that of galactose-6-sulfate at the nonreducing end of keratan
sulfate (5,6). GALNS deficiency (mucopolysaccharidosis IVA)
is an autosomal recessive disorder clinically divided into
severe, intermediate and mild forms. The best known and the
most severe form is so-called Morquio disease with typical
classical features, including specific spondyloepiphyseal
dysplasia, short trunk dwarfism, coxa valga, odontoid hypoplasia, corneal opacities, preservation of intelligence and
excessive urinary excretion of keratan sulfate and chondroitin6-sulfate (7,8); death usually occurs in the second decade of
life. The intermediate form is somewhat milder (9). In the
mild form, there are only minimal symptoms of the disease
with a potentially normal quality of life (10-13). It has been

suggested that the clinical heterogeneity with a broad spectrum
has different mutations within the GALNS gene (9-13).
GALNS has been purified from human placenta to homogeneity
and a polyclonal antibody against the enzyme has been
developed (4,14). However, as it is difficult to distinguish
among these subtypes by biochemical measurements of the
enzyme activity, mutation research will provide an explanation
for the clinical variation at the molecular level.
Investigation into the molecular basis of MPS IVA patients
has been facilitated by isolation and characterization of the
full-length cDNA encoding human GALNS (15). Southern
blot analysis showed one common rearrangement (16,17).
Availability of the cDNA structure facilitated the analyses of
the first two exonic mutations (1342delCA and N204K) causing
severe and mild forms of MPS IVA (18). The genomic gene
encoding GALNS has been isolated (19) and the chromosomal
localization has been mapped (20-22). Knowledge of the exonintron structure makes it more feasible to detect various

342

mutations containing splice site mutations (23) or exon skipping
from genomic DNA. Multiple polymorphisms have also been
described (17,24-26; unpublished data).
As part of our ongoing studies on the molecular basis of
MPS IVA, we adopted a combined protocol of heteroduplex
and SSCP analysis to facilitate a rapid and reliable detection
of mutation and to avoid false negative results. To better
understand the relationship of genotype to clinical phenotype
and to study the distribution of mutations within the GALNS
gene, we investigated 16 different small mutations in 17
patients with MPS IVA.

RESULTS
Southern blots, PCR amplification, heteroduplex analysis
and SSCP analysis
Southern blot analysis was obtained using the GALNS cDNA
probe and genomic probes with patients' genomic DNAs
digested by BamHl, HindlU and EcoRL Six alleles (five
patients) had some large rearrangements. A common, large
structural rearrangement was indicated by the presence of
identical abnormal fragments and restriction enzyme mapping.
One patient (case 11) was homozygous and three patients

(cases 9, 10 and 12) were heterozygous for this rearrangement
(data will be reported in detail elsewhere). In another allele, a
different large rearrangement was suggested by gene dosage
(case 8, manuscript in preparation).
Oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify all coding
regions of the GALNS gene in all 14 exonic fragments (Table
1, Fig. 1). The 26 alleles in 16 patients were of an apparently
identical size, as were ones from controls in all 14 exons
amplified from genomic DNA. For these alleles, heteroduplex
analysis and SSCP analysis by MDE gel were made. The
SSCP pattern of some exon-fragments in patients showed a
clear, abnormal mobility, compared to control (data not shown).
Altered SSCP bands were observed for other fragments and
are summarized (Table 2). The heteroduplex analysis also
revealed bands with an abnormal mobility (data not shown),
and as expected, the most striking example was the sample
where the heteroduplexes were presumed to contain 'a bubble'
due to a 2 bp deletion. Addition of control DNA product

in the text).

to each patient's PCR fragment enhanced the appropriate
differences, compared to control, in some patients homozygous
for the mutation (IVSlnt-2) or apparently hemizygous (i.e.,
each patient is heterozygous for one point mutation, while the
other allele was confirmed to be a large deletion, by Southern
blotting; Q148X, P151S, V138A, R386C: to be reported
elsewhere). Under the single SSCP conditions we used, we
detected 13 previously uncharacterized and two known different mutations. All 15 mutations could be clearly distinguished
from the wild type. In contrast, 9 of 15 mutations [11 (42%)
of 26 alleles] were distinguishable from the wild type, by
heteroduplex analysis. With use of the MDE gel, SSCP proved
to be a more efficient technique with high sensitivity and
specificity, compared tofindingswith the heteroduplex analysis.
As a result, in the 25 of 28 alleles investigated (89%), 15
kinds of mutations were identified using this screening system.
Sequence analysis of positive fragments
PCR fragments with an abnormal mobility were further studied
by subcloning in T-vector and cycle sequencing, and 15 various
kinds of mutations causing this disorder were determined
(11 kinds of polymorphic nucleotide substitutions were also
observed and only one of 11 polymorphisms had an altered
amino acid sequence) (24—26; unpublished data).
Sequence analysis revealed 13 point mutations in 12 cases,
one 2 bp deletion in two cases and one splice site mutation in
one sibling (Fig. 2). In severe cases 1 to 9, 11 kinds of small
mutations (9 exonic point mutations, one 2 bp deletion and
one splice mutation) were detected. The 2 bp deleted mutation
found was 1342delCA, seen as a homozygous state in case 3
(previously reported case) and as a compound heterozygote in
case 4. The deletion of 2 bp CA residues at cDNA base
positions 1343 and 1344 resulted in a frameshift mutation and
the resulting frame in the 1342delCA allele was altered after
the His codon until a stop codon was reached at position 1558
to 1560 (TGA) (18). The IVSlnt-2 mutation was the only

splice site mutation of all mutations studied in the GALNS
gene (23).
The seven exonic point mutations found in severe patients
were D344N, M343R, F346L, M318R, R386C, Q148X and
P151S. Both the E450V and V488M point mutations were
observed on the same allele in the case 6 patient, and confirmed
by genomic DNA and further mutant cDNA sequencing. Only
the mother was found heterozygous for this double point
mutation, determined by sequence analysis of the cDNA
product; the father had neither E450V nor V488M mutations.
Another mutation on the other allele remains to be identified
as no other abnormal band containing a mutation was detectable. In two intermediate cases (12 and 13), two different
kinds of point mutations other than the N204K mutation
defining a mild case were detected; the first one, VI38A (case
12), was a T to C substitution resulting in a Val (GTC) replaced
by an Ala (GCC) at codon 138; the second one, R94C (case
13) was a C to T substitution resulting in an Arg (CGC) to

Cys (TGC) change at codon 94 and the third one was R94G,
another C to G substitution causing an Arg (CGC) to Gly
(GGC) change at codon 94 at the same nucleotide position as
the R94C. The second R94C mutation was also observed in
case 16 with an atypical type and a 2-3% residual activity
of GALNS.
In Japanese brothers with mild type (cases 14 and 15) with
a 2-3% residual activity, the N204K mutation was seen as a
homozygous state (previously reported case). This N204K
change was also detected in a heterozygous state in one
Japanese patient with an intermediate form and harboring
R94G on the other allele.
Restriction enzyme analysis
After complete sequencing of the PCR products, restriction
enzyme analysis or/and allelic-specific oligonucleotide hybridization were done to confirm the mutation and to screen other
patients' PCR products for these known mutations.

in both mutant alleles (R94C and fragments of 121, 156 and 277 bp, as a heterozygote.

The M318R mutation destroys the site at which Fokl cleaves
the 189 bp segment to 107 bp and 82 bp (Fig. 3a). The V488M
alteration creates a Nspl restriction site, at which a 295 bp
segment is divided into 190 bp and 105 bp (Fig. 3b). Other
data on restriction enzyme analysis of each mutation, except
the R94C, R94G and IVSlnt-2 mutations, indicated that it was
feasible to detect a one base substitution (data not shown).

(Fig. 3c). Different single base substitutions for both mutations
(from sequencing data) were found at the same position
(R94C: -CGC-->-TGC-, R94G: -CGC-->-GGC-). Therefore,
these two mutations could not be distinguished using only
newly destroyed Fokl, although allelic-specific oligohybridization (ASO) analysis did lead to identification of this one base
mismatch (see below).

recognized clearly, as another Fokl site existed at position of
5 bp downstream of the new site (ggATGGGATGNN N N I N N N N N I ) . TO confirm this mutation, ASO analysis
was also done (see below).
Allelic-specific oligohybridization analysis
Amplified genomic DNA was examined for confirmation of
the precise genotype by means of ASO, using the dot blot
method, if there were no altered recognition sites in the area
of mutations (P151S, 1342delCA and E450V) or there was
difficulty in detecting mutations by restriction enzyme analysis
(IVSlnt-2, R94C and R94G) (data not shown).
An amplified DNA sample in exon 5 from case 10 with
P151S and double gene deletion was found specifically to
hybridize with the PI5IS mutation-specific oligonucleotide
but not to hybridize with the nominal-specific oligonucleotide,
indicating that the patient seemed to be a homozygote for this
allele (detailed analysis will be reported elsewhere). DNA
sample from the case 6 patient with the double point mutation
of E450V and V488M was hybridized with normal and mutant
ASO probes (O-3, 4, 5 and 6) shown as a heterozygote.
PCR products from sibling cases 1 and 2 with IVSlnt-2
were hybridized only to the mutant ASO sequence (0-2), and
these two cases were homozygous for this mutant allele, as
identified by sequencing (23).
Although restriction enzyme analysis could not separate the
R94C mutation in case 16 from the R94G mutation in case
13 because of the same mutational nucleotide position, dot
blot analysis could define these two mutations using each
mutant-specific oligonucleotide. Each amplified DNA sample
from cases 13 and 16 patients tested positive for the R94G or
R94C mutation-specific ASO probe, respectively. The ASO
probe to the normal sequence at this nucleotide position also
hybridized with these DNA samples, indicating a heterozygote
for each mutant allele. Enzyme restriction analysis and ASO
hybridization revealed that none of the above mutations were
present in 50 normal chromosomes but were present in
MPSIVA chromosomes.
Expression of mutagenized cDNA
cDNAs, each bearing only one of the 15 identified exonic
mutations, were constructed from the normal cDNA, using
in vitro mutagenesis. GALNS-deficient fibroblasts transfected
by the pCAGGS vector carrying GALNS cDNA constructs of
the 15 different mutations failed to express GALNS activity.

^Transient assay for all normal or mutant vectors was confirmed in two
independent experiments. GALNS activity shown in this table is average of
two transfected assays.

cDNA and V488M construct had nearly the same level of
activity as seen in the normal control fibroblasts, thereby
suggesting that V488M is a silent polymorphism.
There were no clear differences observed among other
different mutations in multiple independent experiments,
except for one mutation (V488M) (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
The positions of the mutations in GALNS are shown in Figure
4. The mutations so far identified in MPS IVA patients are
spread evenly throughout the coding region of the GALNS
gene. No single small mutation has been found to account for
a large fraction of the MPS IVA cases in the Japanese
population, thereby implying that there is no definite mutational
hot spot. Simple screening methods combined with PCR,
SSCP and heteroduplex analysis have also been developed for
identification of single base mismatches or small rearrangements. Thus, one can rapidly screen the entire GALNS gene
to localize the mutation to a specific exon. This can then be
followed by cycle sequencing of that exon and exon/intron
junction to identify the mutation.

The use of heteroduplex analysis or SSCP analysis with
MDE gel facilitated the detection of small mutations. However,
SSCP analysis identified 15 mutations derived from 23 alleles
(23/26:88%). On the other hand, heteroduplex analysis revealed
nine different mutations, present in 11 of 26 alleles (11/
26:42%). These results indicate that SSCP was a more efficient
method of screening for small mutations in the GALNS gene,
using this unique gel.
Additionally, 11 polymorphic nucleotide substitutions were
also detected with this system and some were informative for
haplotype analysis to provide important information on the
origin and distribution of known mutations and carrier
diagnosis with undetermined mutations (data not shown).
Eleven of 15 of these mutations had an altered restriction
enzyme site; therefore PCR amplification of the target DNA
followed by restriction enzyme digestion proved to be rapid
and such known mutations could be easily detected. Screening
for the other mutations with no change in the restriction
enzyme site or the R94C and R94G mutations at the same
nucleotide position was effectively facilitated by ASO analysis.
After detecting mutations, the phenotypic characterization
of some mutations was inferred from clinical properties of
homozygous patients, or of heterozygous patients with other
characterized mutations. Homozygotes for the new mutations
would be expected to be rare in a randomly breeding population
but were encountered in consanguineous patients of our study.
Severe sibling cases 1 and 2 were homozygous for IVS1 nt-2,
severe case 3 for 1342delCA and mild sibling cases 14 and
15 for N204K, respectively (Table 4). Moreover, in the severe
case 11 patient in whom a double gene deletion was present
in both alleles, no functional GALNS activity or mRNA could
be defined, thereby suggesting that this large rearrangement

would define a severe form. From these observations of
homozygous mutations, the phenotype was assumed when
another mutation was in heterozygous combination with the
1342delCA, N204K, IVS 1 nt-2 or double gene deletion
mutation.
Sulfatase family cDNAs such as human GALNS, IDS (28),
G6S (29), ARSA (30), ARSB (31), ARSC (32) and ARSU
(33) have been isolated and the amino acid sequences were
compared. There was a striking sequence homology (around
30%), especially in N-terminal (residues 31-144), the central
(residues 225-365) and the C-terminal (residues 438^150). It
has been suggested that highly homologous regions are necessary for the maintenance of the common sulfatase, while nonhomologous regions are important for transmembrane domains,
glycosylation, internal proteolysis and substrate binding (15).
Eight point mutations affected amino acids conserved in
more than three of seven sulfatases (R94C, R94G, V138A,
P151S, M343R, D344N, F346L and E450V), while the other
six point mutations were detected in non-conserved regions.
Conserved amino acids regions are functionally more essential than non-conserved regions and it was speculated that the
occurrence of mutations in a highly homologous region might
give rise to severely affected patients (34). The present
identification of mutations such as R94C, R94G and VI38A
causing milder MPS IVA in a conserved region provides
further insight into this controversy. As the substitution of
arginine for cysteine is from a basic hydrophobic amino acid
to a neutral hydrophobic one, with small change of secondary
structure, the GALNS protein structure is expected to change
slightly.
Therefore, even in a conserved region, the determinant
factor for phenotypic characteristics relates not only to a

another mutation (e.g., E450V mutation in this study). Further
detection of mutations in MPS IVA patients will reveal whether
or not this polymorphism is causative for GALNS deficiency.
Reliable enzymatic tests to accurately predict the severity
of MPS IVA in unrelated patients are not available. Nevertheless, the present identification of specific molecular defects in
MPS IVA patients will facilitate more precise carrier testing
and provide the basis for genotype/phenotype correlations for
this disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We studied the mutations in 16 patients from 14 unrelated families (four
females, 12 males; fifteen Japanese, one Caucasian; 12 sporadic cases, two
sets of siblings). Five Japanese patients were the offspring of first cousin
parents, including two sets of siblings (10,24-26). Diagnoses were confirmed
by demonstration of low GALNS activity in leukocytes or fibroblasts (27).
The clinical evaluation of most of the patients included complete medical
history, physical examination, routine hematological and biochemical tests
and measurement of fibroblast GALNS activity. Radiological studies were
also done to determine clinical severity, including chest radiograph and bone
survey (cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine; long bones, pelvis and skull).
Patients were assigned to one of three clinical phenotypes, except for one
atypical case; severe (classical), intermediate or mild.
One fibroblast sample originated from a Caucasian and was obtained from
the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Coriell Institute for Medical
Research, Camden, NJ), where it is listed as GM958; the diagnosis was an
atypical case with 3% of residual activity (clinical data and other laboratory
findings were unknown).
Eleven Japanese patients with one sibling were cases of classical Morquio
disease, the other sibling cases reported previously (18) were a mild form
with below 2% residual activity. The intermediate form was diagnosed in two
Japanese patients.

DNA analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts,
according to standard methods. The genomic DNA samples were amplified
by PCR with Taq polymerase (Wako, Osaka, Japan). The cycling reaction
was done in a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT),
including a total volume of 100 |il, with iXTaq polymerase buffer (50 mM
KC1, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% gelatin), 50 pmol of
each primer, 200 u.M mixed dNTPs, 2.5U Taq DNA polymerase and genomic
DNA or first strand cDNA. Amplification procedure for every fragment
involved 40 cycles of PCR, as follows: 1 min at 94°C (denaturation), I min
at 54-65°C (annealing of primers), and I min at 72°C (extension). After the
last cycle, the samples were incubated for an additional 7 min at 72°C. The
primer sequences and allele specific oligomers used for mutation analysis
and mutagenic oligonucleotides were synthesized on an automated DNA
synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA); their sequences are listed
in Tables 1, 5 and 6, except for the primers used for cDNA amplification as
already described (18).

change in the essential conserved amino acid but also to the
effect on secondary or/and tertiary structure, by amino acid
substitution.
A higher in vitro expression would make way for precise
comparisons of the activity and stability of the residual enzymes
expressed by each mutant GALNS allele. It seems likely that
residual activities expressed by the mutant alleles would be
too low for biochemical characterization. The V488M mutation
carried an unexpected increase of GALNS activity in the
transient expression study, hence, this alteration is a polymorphism. However, as we did not see this V488M alteration in fifty
normal individuals, this rare polymorphism may effect the
reduction of enzyme activity in vivo, in association with

Southern blots. As a first screening, Southern blots were obtained to detect
large rearrangements and polymorphisms, using GALNS cDNA probes and
genomic DNA probes together with several kinds of restriction enzymes.
Heteroduplex analysis by MDE gel. Heteroduplex analysis using MDE
(mutation detection enhancement, AT Biochem, Malvern, PA) gel was done
on individual amplified exons and exon/intron junctions which varied from
168 bp to 411 bp. To screen mutations, initially 5 \i\ of the PCR product from
each patient was used and was analyzed as a loading sample, then 2.5 \x\ of
the PCR product from the patient and 2.5 |il of the PCR product from a
normal control were mixed and screened to avoid missing a homozygous
mutation and to create an artificial heterozygous state. Before loading, I |il
of gel loading buffer for each 5 nl of sample was added, boiled for 2 min
and slowly cooled down to room temperature. Samples for every exon were
electrophoresed at 700 volts constant power for 20 h on a 20X35 cm gel in
0.6XTBE. After electrophoresis, the DNA was visualised following ethidium
bromide staining for 20 min followed by destaining for 3 h.
SSCP analysis by MDE. For SSCP analysis, each fragment of 168 bp to 411
bp was amplified using unlabeled primers, and 0.2 ^1 of [32P]dCTP (3000

Human Molecular Genetics, 1995, Vol. 4, No. 3 349
Ci/m mol; Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) was added in the reaction
mixture. The concentration of dNTPs was lowered to 20 U.M and the reaction
volume to 10 |il. Following amplification, 1 \i\ of the reaction mixture was
mixed with 9 nl of 95% formamide, 0.05% bromophenol blue, 0.05% xylene
cyanol, 10 mM NaOH and 20 mM EDTA. The mixture was boiled for 2 min,
cooled on ice and applied on MDE gel (described in detail in heteroduplex
analysis) containing 0.6XTBE. No other additives such as formamide, DMSO,
urea or sucrose were included in this MDE gel.
Electrophoresis was done for 12 to 30 h adequate to the fragment size at 6
Watts at room temperature. The gel was transferred to chromatographic paper
(3MM Chr, Whatman, Maidstone, UK), dried and exposed to X-ray film for
24 h.
Sequencing. All the amplified fragments, showing abnormal mobility by SSCP
and heteroduplex analysis, were purified and subcloned into T-vector (Novagen,
Madison, WI).
DNA sequencing of at least five independent clones for each fragment was
done in both directions, by the cycle sequencing method with Taq polymerase,
for the incorporation of fluorescent labeled dideoxynucleotides (ABI, Foster
City, CA). Reactions were analyzed by an ABI373A fluorescent DNA
sequencer.
Restriction enzyme analysis. Restriction enzyme digestion was used to determine the presence of each mutation, respectively. Restriction enzymes were
purchased from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemics (Mannheim, Germany),
New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan) and
Toyobo (Osaka, Japan) (Table 2).
Allelic-specific oligonucleotide hybridization analysis. Mutations IVSlnt-2,
R94C, R94G, E450V and V488M were also detected by means of oligonucleotide hybridization of PCR amplified fragments of genomic DNA.
Two (il of amplified samples was dotted by a dot apparatus (BRL,
Gaithersburg, MD) and Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham) and hybridized separately with the appropriate normal and mutant oligonucleotide probe
(see Table 5).
The procedure is as follows: 2(0.1 of amplified product, 178 nl of ddH2O
and 20 (il of denaturing solution (2N NaOH) were mixed and incubated for
10 min at room temperature; 200 fj.1 of neutralized solution (IM NH4OAc)
was added and chilled on ice. After dot blotting of treated samples on nylon
membrane, the membrane was allowed to air dry and then cross-linked using
an UV cross linker for 5 min. The membrane was then placed into a plastic
tube and prehybridized for at least 30 min with 5 ml of hybridization buffer
from a hybridization buffer tablet (Amersham). Next, a 5' oligonucleotide
end-labelled probe with Y[ 32 PJATP and T 4 polynucleotide kinase was added
to the plastic tube together with the same hybridization buffer, and the
membrane was hybridized for at least 2 h at 37°C. Following incubation, the
membrane was washed with 2XSSC, 0.1% SDS solution at room temperature
twice for 15 min each and then washed again with the same solution at the
appropriate temperature (Tm-3°C) twice for 15 min each. The membrane was
briefly dried, enclosed in Saran wrap and exposed at room temperature to
X-ray film for I to 5 h.
Expression of mutagenized cDNA. The method for introducing a series of
mutations into cloned cDNA was done according to instructions in a
Transformer-Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit, by the supplier (Clontech, Palo
Alto, CA). The mutagenic oligonucleotides are listed in Table 5. The sitespecific mutagenized cDNAs were subcloned into pCAGGS (kindly provided
by Dr J.Miyazaki, University of Tokyo). Each mutation in the expression
vector was confirmed by sequencing. Transfection of mutagenized cDNAs
into GALNS-deficient fibroblasts was done using a liposome-mediated method
(Wako) and measurement of GALNS expression was done in the cell extracts
at 120 h after transfection (4,9,15).
