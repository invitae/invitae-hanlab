ABSTRACT
Germ-line mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been observed in patients with Li-Fraumeni
syndrome, brain tumors, second malignancies, and breast
cancers. It is unclear whether all of these mutations have
inactivated p53 and thereby provide an increased risk for
cancer. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the biological
significance of these germ-line mutations by the functional and
structural analysis of the resulting mutant p53 proteins. We
analyzed the ability of seven germ-line mutant proteins observed in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, second primary neoplasms, or familial breast cancer to block the growth
of malignant cells and compared the structural properties of the
mutant proteins to that of the wild-type protein. Six of seven
missense mutations disrupted the growth inhibitory properties
and structure of the wild-type protein. One germ-line mutation
retained the features of the wild-type p53. Genetic analysis of
the breast cancer family in which this mutation was observed
indicated that this germ-line mutation was not associated with
the development of cancer. These results demonstrate that
germ-line p53 mutations observed in patients with LiFraumeni syndrome and with second malignancies have inactivated the p53 tumor suppressor gene. The inability of the
germ-line p53 mutants to block the growth of malignant cells
can explain why patients with these germ-line mutations have
an increased risk for cancer. The observation of a functionally
silent germ-line mutation indicates that, before associating a
germ-line tumor suppressor gene mutation with cancer risk, it
is prudent to consider its functional significance.

patients with brain tumors (6) and sarcomas (28), patients
who have developed a second primary neoplasm (29), and
those with familial breast cancer (30, 31). The involvement of
a germ-line p53 mutation in the development of cancer can be
demonstrated by the cosegregation of the mutant allele with
cancer in the affected family members. This has only been
possible to do in three families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
(3-5). As new germ-line p53 mutations are detected in
pedigrees with a limited familial history and few available
samples, the genetic analysis is sometimes impossible to
perform. When linkage analysis is not possible, it is difficult
to determine if missense mutations have a biological significance or instead represent previously undetected rare polymorphisms.
The functional and structural properties of p53 have been
extensively analyzed (1). One of the main properties of the
wild-type protein is the ability to inhibit the growth of
malignant cells in culture (7-13). Mutations observed in
human sporadic tumors (like the mutations at codons 143 and
273) have been shown to disrupt this growth inhibitory
property (7, 10, 12, 13). Furthermore, most of the p53
mutations observed in human tumors induce structural modifications of the wild-type protein (1).
In this study, we analyzed the biological properties of
germ-line p53 mutants to determine if these mutations had
inactivated the wild-type p53 protein and therefore provided
a high risk for cancer. Missense mutations at codons 181, 245,
248, 252, 258, 273, and 282 were selected because they were
observed in patients with different clinical presentations
(Li-Fraumeni syndrome, second malignancies, familial
breast carcinoma) and because they were distributed between the conserved regions III and V of the p53 protein (see
Table 1). Although some of these mutations had already been
observed in sporadic tumors (14), the only mutation to have
been partially characterized was the mutation at codon 273
(1, 10, 15).

Mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is currently the
most frequent molecular alteration in human cancers (1, 2).
These changes are mostly missense mutations primarily
found at evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues (1, 2).
Ninety-eight percent of the 280 base substitution mutations
reported so far in malignant tumors are clustered between
amino acid residues 110 and 307 (out of a total of 393 amino
acids) (2). In most of the human cancers analyzed, both p53
alleles are inactivated, suggesting that loss of wild-type
function is important in carcinogenesis (1). Recent work has
indicated that mutations of the p53 gene can occur not only
at the somatic level but also in the germ line. These findings
are important because the detection of germ-line p53 mutations should allow the identification of subjects at high risk to
develop cancer. Germ-line p53 mutations were initially reported in patients with the rare Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a
family cancer syndrome in which affected relatives develop
a diverse set of malignancies, including breast carcinomas,
sarcomas, and brain tumors (3-5). Analysis of germ-line p53
mutations outside Li-Fraumeni syndrome has revealed that
these germ-line mutations occasionally can be observed in

control of the cytomegalovirus promoter enhancer and the
neomycin-resistance gene is under the control of the simian
virus 40 (SV40) promoter enhancer. The complete coding
region derived from the mutant M13 clone was entirely
sequenced to ensure that the mutant cDNA contained only
the desired mutation. The mutant p53 protein at codon 273
was expressed by the plasmid pSVXRI (10).
Cell Culture and Transfection. The Saos-2 cell line was
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, and the
cells were grown as described (10). Plasmid DNA (10 Ag)
expressing wild-type or mutant p53 protein was transfected
using the calcium phosphate procedure into Saos-2 cells at
50-70%o confluence in 10-cm plates. For stable transfections,
the cells were incubated with the DNA/phosphate precipitate
during 4 hr, split 1:3 the next day, and refed with medium
containing 500 pug of Geneticin (G418; GIBCO) per ml 48 hr
after the transfection. The plates were stained with 50%o
methanol/10%o acetic acid/0.25% Coomassie blue after 3
weeks of selection in G418-containing medium and the numbers of colonies were counted. For cotransfection experiments, 10 Ag of p53 construct and 10 Ag of plasmid pSVlacO
[expressing SV40 large T antigen (16)] were transfected into
Saos-2 cells as indicated.
Antibodies, Immunoprecipitations, and Western Blot Analysis. PAb122 recognizes an epitope located between amino
acids 370 and 378 of p53. PAb240 recognizes an epitope
located between amino acids 156 and 335. The monoclonal
antibody PAb416 is directed to the large T antigen of SV40.
The monoclonal antibody directed against heat shock proteins was obtained from Amersham. Cells were metabolically
labeled with 300 pUCi of [35S]methionine (NEN; 670 mCi/
mmol; 1 Ci = 37 GBq) in 2 ml of methionine-free Dulbecco's
modified Eagle medium plus 2% dialyzed fetal calf serum for
2 hr. Lysates and immunoprecipitations were performed as
described (3). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Western blot analysis of
the immunoprecipitated proteins was performed after transfer of the proteins to Immobilon membranes (Millipore).
Sequencing Reactions and PCR Amplification. Sequencing
reactions were performed according to the dideoxy chaintermination method using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (United
States Biochemical). A 129-base-pair (bp) fragment was
generated by PCR amplification from genomic DNA extracted from paraffin blocks (17). For each DNA template,
two independent PCR reactions were performed. The sense
and antisense primers were 181F, 5'-CCGGA ATTCC
GGTGC CCCCA CCATG-3', and 181R, 5'-CGGGA TCCCG
CAATC AGTGA GGAAT C-3', respectively. The primers
181F and 181R have synthetic EcoRI and BamHI sites,
respectively, at their 5' ends to facilitate cloning. The PCR
reactions were performed as described (3). The PCR products
were submitted to Hae II analysis or digested with BamHI
and EcoRI and fractionated by electrophoresis on low-melt

Fragments were ligated into the Bluescript vector

RESULTS
Effect of the Germ-line Mutants on the Growth of Malant
Cells. To determine if germ-line p53 mutations had inactivated the wild-type protein, constructs expressing germ-line
mutant proteins were transfected into Saos-2 osteosarcoma
cells. Both p53 alleles are deleted in this cell line. Previous
studies have shown that the expression of transfected wildtype p53 blocks the progression of the cell cycle prior to S
phase and that expression of the wild-type protein is not
tolerated in stably transfected Saos-2 cells (10). Transfection
of the plasmids expressing the germ-line mutants, except the
mutant at codon 181, resulted in =8-fold more colonies than
occurred when the plasmid pC53-SN3 [expressing wild-type
p53 (7)] was transfected (Table 1, Fig. 1A). Analysis of p53
expression in stable transfectants revealed that most of the
colonies derived from the transfections with the plasmids
encoding the mutants at codons 245, 248, 252, 258, and 282
expressed high levels of p53 protein (Table 1, Fig. 1B). These
results demonstrate that these five mutant proteins [like the
mutant protein at codon 273 (10)] were unable to inhibit the
growth of the Saos-2 cells. In contrast, none of the colonies
derived from the transfection with the plasmid expressing the
mutant protein at codon 181 (Fig. 1B) or the wild-type protein
was found to express p53. This result indicates that the
expression of the mutant protein at codon 181, like the
expression of the wild-type p53, was incompatible with the
growth of Saos-2 cells.
Structural Properties of the Germ-line Mutants. Next, we
tested whether germ-line p53 mutants shared certain unique
structural properties. Many inactivating mutations, which
have been detected in sporadic tumors, have been shown to
produce structural modifications of p53: (i) most of the
mutant proteins are recognized by the antibody PAb240,
which is specific for a mutant conformation (1, 18); (ii)
frequently, the mutant proteins complex with hsc70, a constitutively expressed member ofthe heat shock protein family
(19); (iii) all of the mutations observed in sporadic tumors and
analyzed so far have been shown to disrupt the binding of p53
to SV40 T antigen (1).
As shown in Fig. 1C, immunoprecipitations performed
with the antibody PAb240 revealed that only the germ-line
mutant proteins at codons 245, 252, 258, and 282 were
detected by PAb240. In contrast, the mutants at codons 181
and 248, like the mutation at codon 273 (1), were not
recognized-by this antibody (Fig. 1C).
Immunoprecipitation of the p53 proteins (Fig. 1 B and C)

plates of Saos-2 cells stably transfected with constructs expressing the wild-type protein, the mutant protein at codon 252, and the mutant protein
at codon 181 are shown. (B) p53 levels in stably transfected Saos-2 cells. Lysates from [35S]methionine-labeled cells were immunoprecipitated
with the monoclonal antibody PAb122. Transfected Saos-2 cells, expressing a mutant protein at codon 143, were used as a positive control for
p53 and hsc70 binding (10). (C) Immunoprecipitation of germ-line p53 mutants with the antibody PAb240. Forty-eight hours after transient
transfection of p53 plasmids, Saos-2 cells were [35S]methionine labeled and lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody PAb240 (top) or with
antibody PAb122 (bottom). Cells expressing a mutant protein at codon 143 were used as a positive control for PAb240 (10). (D) Binding of
germ-line mutants to SV40 large T antigen. Saos-2 cells were cotransfected with p53 plasmids and the plasmid pSVlacO (16). Forty-eight hours
after the transfection, lysates from [35S]methionine-labeled cells were immunoprecipitated with either antibody PAb122 (p53) or PAb416 (large
T antigen). p53 proteins that bind large T antigen are coprecipitated by both antibodies.

proteins (data not shown) showed that the mutant proteins at
codon 252 and 258 were able to complex hsc70. A much
weaker binding to hsc70 was occasionally detectable in cells
stably transfected with constructs expressing the mutants at
codon 245 and 282 (data not shown). In contrast, the mutant
proteins at codons 181 and 248 as well as the mutant protein
at codon 273 (1, 15) were unable to bind hsc70.
Cotransfection experiments of the plasmids expressing the
germ-line mutants with a plasmid coding for SV40 large T
antigen (16) demonstrated that only the mutant proteins at
codons 248, 252, and 273 failed to bind large T antigen (Table
1, Fig. 1D). As shown in Table 1, the structural properties of
the germ-line p53 mutants show a high degree of heterogeneity. However, with the exception of the mutant at codon

181, none of the germ-line mutants retained all of the structural features of the wild-type protein.
Genetic Analysis of the Mutation at Codon 181. The functional and structural studies of the germ-line mutants suggested that the mutant at codon 181 (Argo- His) was identical
to the wild-type p53 (Table 1). Therefore, we speculated that
this germ-line mutation might not provide an increased risk
for cancer. To test this hypothesis, we performed genetic
analysis on the family in which this germ-line p53 mutation
has been observed. This mutation was detected in a patient
(III-8) with a familial breast carcinoma (Fig. 2A) (30). This
family is suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome but does not
fit the classic definition because the only sarcoma occurred
after age 45 (20, 21). Using the PCR, we analyzed the codon

FIG. 2. Genetic analysis of a breast cancer family with a mutant p53 gene at codon 181. (A) Abridged pedigree of the family; the arrow
indicates the proband: 11-2, breast cancer at age 46; 11-3, breast cancer (undetermined age); 11-4, prostatic carcinoma (undetermined age); 111-3,
retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma at age 49; III-5, breast cancer at age 40 and colon cancer at age 47; 111-8, breast cancer at age 41; 111-9, Hodgkin
disease at age 22 and breast cancer at age 31. A germ-line mutation at codon 181 of one p53 allele (181/wt) was found in three affected members
(111-3, 111-8, 111-9), whereas one affected member (111-5) has not inherited the mutation at codon 181 (wt/wt). The wild-type allele was lost in
the leiomyosarcoma of patient 111-3 and in the breast cancer of patient 111-8 (181/-); the mutant allele was lost in the breast cancer of patient
111-9 (wt/-). For patient 111-3, 2 of 6 clones derived from constitutional cells (normal kidney) and 7 of 7 clones derived from tumor cells had
the codon 181 mutation. For patient 111-5, 14 of 14 clones derived from constitutional cells (benign naevi and benign colonic polyp) were wild
type at codon 181. For patient 111-9, 3 of 6 clones derived from constitutional cells (normal spleen) and 13 of 15 clones derived from tumor block
were wild type at codon 181. The presence of the codon 181 mutation in 2 clones out of 15 suggests a minor contamination by normal cells in
the tumor block. (B) Restriction enzyme analysis of p53 codon 181. DNA was amplified using primers 181F and 181R, digested with Hae II,
separated on a 1.8% agarose gel, and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Hae II-digested normal DNA yields 99-bp and 30-bp fragments.
Mutation at codon 181 leads to the loss of the Hae II restriction site and a 129-bp fragment is detected. Lane 1, molecular weight marker; lane

of the Hae II restriction site (AGCGCT

is normally present in the amplified fragment. Restriction
analysis (Fig. 2B) and nucleic acid sequencing indicated that
one affected sister with a leiomyosarcoma (111-3) had inherited the mutation at codon 181 and that only the mutant allele
was retained in the tumor. Restriction analysis also revealed
that another sister with breast and colon cancers (III-5) had
not inherited the mutation at codon 181 (Fig. 2B). Patient
111-9, who had developed a breast carcinoma and a Hodgkin
disease, has inherited the mutation at codon 181, but the
mutant allele was lost somatically in the breast tumor (Fig.
2A).

DISCUSSION
The ability of the wild-type p53 protein to block the growth
of malignant cells in culture is one of the main findings that
has suggested that the p53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene (1,
7-13). Our results demonstrate that germ-line mutations
observed in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome or with
second malignancies disrupt this function ofthe wild-type p53
protein. These data indicate that one p53 allele has been
inactivated in these patients. The inactivation of the growth
inhibitory properties of p53 can explain why patients with
these germ-line mutations have an increased risk of cancer.
The biological significance of these germ-line mutations is
confirmed by the fact that none of the germ-line mutants
observed in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome or with
second malignancies that we have analyzed have the same
structural properties as the wild-type protein. Among these
structural properties, it is important to point out the ability of
some germ-line mutants to bind hsc70. The hsc7O binding
property of some mutant p53 proteins observed in tumors has
been linked to their ability to inactivate the wild-type protein

and to have a dominant negative activity (15, 22). It has been
speculated that only mutants unable to complex hsc7O will be
found in the germ-line (3). Our current results show that
germ-line mutants are not restricted to those unable to
complex hsc70, as we previously suggested (3).
According to our analysis, one germ-line mutant protein
observed in a patient with a familial breast carcinoma had a
wild-type phenotype. We cannot exclude the possibility that
this mutation altered a property of p53 that we have not
examined, such as the transformation-suppressing activity in
a ras complementation assay (23), transactivation (24, 25),
and/or DNA binding activity (26). Nevertheless, genetic
analysis of the cancer-prone family in which this mutation at
codon 181 was observed provided two pieces of data that
suggest that the mutation at codon 181 was not associated
with the development of cancer in all members of this family.
This mutation was not present in the germ line of a family
member who developed two cancers. More important, the
mutant allele at codon 181 was somatically lost during the
development of a cancer in another relative.
We conclude from this study that six germ-line missense
mutations reported in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
and in patients with second malignancies have inactivated the
wild-type p53 protein. Nevertheless, our analysis of the
mutation at codon 181 indicates that germ-line mutations,
which change the amino acid sequence in the conserved
domains of p53 (27), will not always be associated with an
increased risk for early cancer. Therefore, genetic or biological analysis of the germ-line mutations in tumor suppressor
genes should be a prerequisite before any counseling about
cancer risk is provided to patients.
