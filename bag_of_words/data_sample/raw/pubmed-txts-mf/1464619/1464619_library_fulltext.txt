The human PC gene (19) and its cDNA (20) have been
cloned and sequenced. Eight exons constitute the entire coding region of a single-chain form of PC, which contain all of
its functional domains (19). The second exon, which begins
at residue -19 of the signal sequence and terminatesat amino
acid residues 37/38 of the mature protein, contains all nine
Gla residues of human PC. Exon 3 terminates at residue 46,
and encodes a short helical area of the protein that has been
implicated in stabilization of a proper Ca2+-inducedconformation in prothrombin (21). Active site residue H i P 1 is
present in exon 7, and exon 8 contains the othertwo residues,
Aspzss and Ser3@,of the catalytic triad of APC. Processing
events that generate mature plasma PC include cleavage of
the leader polypeptide (19); y-carboxylation of the 9 Glaprecursor E residues, present at amino acid sequence positions

dipeptide from the single-chain form of PC, areaction that is
essential to generate the two-chain form of PC (20, 22); and
glycosylation of Ame7,A d a 8 , Asn313,and Asn3" (24).
The post-translational processing of appropriate precursor
E residues to Gla residues allows vitamin K-dependent blood
coagulation proteins to bind to Ca2+and PL,interactions that
are essential to their proper functioning (for a review, see Ref.
25). With regard to PC, it has been demonstrated that incomplete y-carboxylation of random Gla-precursor E residues
(26), as well as proteolytic removal of the entire Gla domain
of plasma PC (15), leads to a substantial decrease of the
anticoagulant activities of the respective APCs. This laboratory is interested in definition of the roles of specific Gla
residues in the various structural andfunctional properties of
this protein. To date, employing site-directed mutagenesis of
PC, we have demonstrated that double mutations that prevent
y-carboxylation at the Epairspresent
at r-PC sequence
positions 6 and 7 (27), and 19 and 20 (28), residues conserved
in all vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins, greatly reduce the anticoagulant properties of the resulting variant rAPC molecules. We have also constructed, expressed, and
purified r-PC molecules containing individual mutations at
all Gla-precursor E residues, and showed that only Gla residues 6,14, and 19 are dispensable to theanticoagulant activity
of APC (29). In the currentcommunication, we report results
obtained from an investigation of the specific Gla residues
necessary for adoption of the proper Ca2+-inducedconformation of PC. Such an investigation is of fundamental importance tounderstanding the roles of individual Gla residues as
determinants of the structureof functional PC andAPC.

Fluorescence-Fluorescence measurements were conducted at
20 "C with use of an SLM-Aminco 8000 (SLM-Aminco Instruments,
Urbana, IL) recording spectrofluorometer. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 283 and 340 nm, respectively. The relevant rPC (absorbance a t 280 nm = 0.1) in a solution of20mM Tris-HC1,
100 mM NaC1, pH 7.4, was partly degassed under gentle vacuum and
subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. This solution
was adjusted to a volume of 1 ml with this same buffer, and the
absorbance a t 280 nm was measured. After equilibration at 20 "C for
10 min, at which time a stable fluorescence base line was achieved
( F J , the fluorescence intensity ( F ) was measured following each
addition (2 pl) of a stock solution (2-2500 mM, depending upon the
particular variant used) of CaClz (the total volume of Ca2+added in

the method previously described (31). Plasma PC (5 pglml), in a
buffer composed of 20 mM Tris-HC1, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS),
was used to coat the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate at 4 "C
overnight. Unoccupied sites in the wells were blocked by incubation
of the plates for 2 h at 37 "C with a solution (200 pl) of 1%(w/v)
gelatin in TBS. A total of 150 pl of a solution of '=I-JTC-l or '"1JTC-3 (cu. 14,000 cpm/well), 1%(w/v) gelatin in TBS, containing
different concentrations of CaC12 (0-40 mM), was added to each well
and allowed to incubate for 3 h a t 37 "C. After washing the wells 3 X
with TBS containing the same Ca2+concentration, individual wells
were cut from the plate and the amount of radioactivity present was
measured with a y-counter (Beckman Gamma 4000).
The maximum amount of antibody bound to any of the r-PC
variants ([Ab],,) was determined from the Ca2+titration data. The
radioactivity bound to each variant at each Ca2+concentration/([Ab]
,-I) X 100 was taken as thepercent of antibody bound at these same
Caz+concentrations. The concentration of Ca2+required for binding
of antibody to 50% of the PC molecules, as estimated directly from
the graphs, is defined as theCWvalue. For all experiments performed,
standardizations of the amounts of r-PC variants adsorbed to the
plate were achieved by performing parallel experiments with another
monoclonal antibody, 12'I-C3, the binding of which is independent of
Ca2+,and of the Gla domain (30).

mation of the Ca2+/Gla domain
complex is very different than
that of the other proteins investigated in this study. These
results demonstrate the importance
of a Gla16for maintenance
of the proper Ca2+-dependent final conformation of PC. Finally, another residue of extreme importance was found at
the highly conserved Arg", in which the Ca2+-inducedfluorescence change did notoccur. This suggests that either Ca2+
binding has been greatly affected by this change, or that the
final conformation of the Ca'+/PC complex was dramatically
different from that of wtr-PC.
The next phase
of this investigation centered upon
employment of Ca2+-dependent conformationalmonoclonal antibodies, JTC-1 and JTC-3, to assess the abilities of each of the
Gla mutants to interact with Ca2+ in such a manner as to
produce the same final conformation as in wtr-PC. These
distinct antibodies have been previously characterized and
their epitopes both exist in the Gla domain
of the Ca2+induced conformation of PC (31). Examples of typical titrations with Ca2+ are illustrated inFig. 3 for wtr-PC and three
of its recombinant mutants, anda summary of the c60 values
obtained from these measurements is provided in Table 11.
Both human plasma PC and wtr-PC
showed the expected
dependency onCa2+of binding of each of the antibodies, with
virtually identical ($0 values. In addition, variants [Gla2, +
Asplr-PC and [Gln3' + Glalr-PC appeared to undergo the
normal dependency on Ca2+ toward binding
of each antibody.

we have purposely
designed the most conservative of possible mutations, since
our interest was to discover which of the Gla residues are
most essential to the properties under
investigation. With
conservative mutations, subsequent
loss of the property under
investigation can bemost safely attributed to theGla residue
that was eliminated. However, retention of the property with
these mutations does not preclude the possibility that other
types of less conservative mutations would cause loss of the
function of interest. These latter types
of approachesare
underway, and will reveal additional informationin the future.

numbering system for human PC and the amino acid residue at that position in PC, if it is different from prothrombin. Since there is not
strong sequence homology between bovine prothrombin and human PC between residues 43-62, the residue in parenthesis is the amino acid
in PC a t the same sequence position as in prothrombin. The side chain carbon atoms of Gla residues are in yellow, and those of residues other
than Gla are orange. Nitrogen atoms are in blue, oxygens in red, sulfurs in pink, and hydrogens in green. The polypeptide chain backbone of
the hexapeptide disulfide loop containing Gla residues 20 (Gla") and 21 (Gla") is illustrated, with peptide bond carbon atoms in white. Each
of the seven Ca2+atoms are depicted by the white spheres,with their surface availabilities indicated. The ribbon of the backbone structure is
illustrated in navy blue. The amino-terminal amino group of A1 is also shown, since it is of such importance in formation of hydrogen bonds
and OE4 of Gla2'(GlaZ6).Other hydrogen bonds depicted are those between the HH12 proton
with OE3 of Gla17(Gla16),OE4 of Glaz1(GlaZ0),
of Arg6 andOE3 of Gla''(Gla"), presumably of importance in stabilizing the Ca2+-dependentconformation of prothrombin, and between the
HH21 proton ofArg"(Arg")
and the OE4 oxygen ofGla17(Gla16), which we propose is critical to the stability of the Ca2+-dependent
conformation of the Gla domain. We modeled this structure employing the crystal coordinates provided to this laboratory by Dr. Alexander
Tulinsky (Michigan State University).

noted upon addition of Ca2+.There are many similarities in
PC with this structure of prothrombin, as well as some small
differences. The same aromatic residues, F and W, respectively, are present at the homologous sequence positions 40
and 41 in PC, but the Tyr45of prothrombin is replaced by a
H at the homologous sequence position of PC. Thus, this
latter residue does not contributeto theCa2+-inducedfluorescence change in PC. Most of the same aliphatic residues that
are positioned to contribute to the fluorescence blue shift
upon Ca2+addition in prothrombin are in place in PC, with
the exceptions noted. Of significance, the putatively important hydrogen bond between Arg5and Gla", which is believed
t o stabilize the structure of the Gla domain of prothrombin,
cannot be an important factor for PC, since an R does not
exist at the equivalent position of PC. Thus, interdomain
interactions are somewhat different between these two proteins.
Using the above as a model for PC, along with the fluorescence and antibody data of Tables I and 11, we conclude that

GlaZ5of PC (GlaZ6in Fig. 4) is not essential for the integrity
of the Ca2+-dependentconformation of PC. Since this residue
contributes two of the four protein coordination sites to Ca1,and does not coordinate to any other Ca2+(21), its nonessential character can be justified. It is also likely that Ca-1
does not make a contribution in this regard, since loss of two
of its four protein coordination sites wouldlikely greatly
diminish its capacity to bind to PC. However, since a large
activity loss, of 75% of anticoagulation activity, also accompanies this mutation (29))
it may beconfidently assumed that
Ca-1, which resides on the surface of the protein, is important
for binding of APC to phospholipid, and/or protein S, both
events being necessary for expression of anticoagulant activity. The other two coordination sites for Ca-1 are provided by
GlaZ9of PC (Gla3O in Fig. 4), replacement of which also
eliminates anticoagulant activity. Mutation of this latter residue also has an effect on adoption of the Ca2+-dependent
conformation of PC, with fluorescence and antibody data
showing that higher concentrations of Ca2+are needed forthe
conformational alteration to occur. This is most reasonably
explained by recognizing that GlaZ9of PC also provides one
of five protein coordination sites for Ca-2, and one of five
protein donor sites for Ca-3, the latterof which is notexposed
to thesurface. Because of this more extensive interaction with
other Ca" ions, GlaZ9is likely to be important as a structural

determinant. Loss of this residue and its donation to coordination most likely is the reason for the defective binding of
Ca2+. This, plus the altered conformation that is adopted,
contributes to the full loss of anticoagulant activity observed
(29), even with this most conservative mutation.
Similarly, some clear interpretations result from consideration of all available data regarding Gla14and Gla" (Gla15 and
GlaZ0,respectively, of prothrombin, Fig. 4) and Ca-7 of PC.
Loss of each of these Gla residues had only small effects on
anticoagulation activity of APC (29), and on the conformational properties of the Caz+-dependentconformation of PC
that are revealed by the fluorescence and antibody measurements of this investigation. Thus, neither of these residues,
nor probably Ca-7, are essential for the integrity of the
structure or the activity of PC and APC. The nonessential
character of GlaI4 of PC is easily accommodated by the fact
that this residue only provides one protein coordination site
for Ca, in particular for Ca-7 (Fig. 4). The only other two
protein coordination sites for Ca-7 are donated byGla"of
PC. The slightly altered Ca2+binding properties which result
from mutation of this residue may reside in the finding that
Gla" provides one of the three protein coordination donor
groups for Ca-6, which may bea more essential Ca2+ion, and
the loss of one of its three protein donor sites may result in
its weaker interaction with PC. Also, it may be the case that
Ca-7 does play some minor role in the integrity of the Ca2+dependent structure of PC and APC.
Most of the Gla residues that coordinate to thenonexposed
Ca2+ions, namely Ca-3, Ca-4, and Ca-5, are of importance to
the Ca2+-dependent anticoagulantactivity and/or structural
properties of APC. Conservative mutation of GlaZ6of PC
(Gla" of prothrombin (Fig. 4)) leads to a complete activity
loss of the Ca2+-dependentanticoagulant activity of APC (29),
complete loss of antibody binding (Table 11), and much higher
C, values to produce the fluorescence alteration that characterizes the Ca2+-dependentconformation (Table I). Since
Gla26of PC provides one of the five protein coordination sites
t o Ca-2, one of the five such sites to Ca-3, and two of the
seven protein donor sites to Ca-4 (21), its necessity for maintenance of the Ca2+-dependentconformation is readily seen.
This is especially true of the dependence of Ca-4 coordination
on Gla". Here, loss of the two protein coordination sites
would morethan likely weaken its binding to theprotein, and
since Ca-4 is an internal calcium, its necessity for maintenance of conformational integrity would be predictable. Similarly, Gla16is a residue of considerable importance. Conservative mutation ofGla16 led to a complete loss of the Ca2+dependent anticoagulant activity of the mutant enzyme and
loss binding of the Ca2+-dependent, Gla domain-directed
monoclonal antibodies. However, the significant differences
in thefluorescenceproperties of the Ca2+/Gladomain complex
between wtr-PCand [Gla16 -+ Asplr-PC suggest that the
entire conformation of this domain has been severely affected.
This is not surprisingwhen it is considered that GlaI6donates
two of five protein coordination sites to Ca-3, two of seven
such sites to Ca-4, and two of five protein donor sites to Ca5. All of these Ca2+ions are not exposed to the surface, and
are probably important for structuralmaintenance of the
Ca2+/Gla domain complex. Loss of all of the coordination
sites provided by Gla16 wouldclearly have very severe effects
on the structure of this complex, and the disruption of its
conformation is therefore entirely expected.
Regarding the pair of Gla residues at 19 and 20of PC
(prothrombin residues 20 and 21), which exist in a hexapeptide disulfide loop, an initial observation demonstrated that
mutation of this pair of Gla residues to D residues, as well as

of Protein C

26083

mutation of one of the covalent-bond-stabilizing C residues
to a S residue, resulted in a complete loss of anticoagulant
activity (28). A subsequent investigation demonstrated that a
single mutation to a D residue at Gla" did not result in a
significant activity loss, whereas a mutation to a D residue at
GlaZ0was itself sufficient to account for the nearly complete
loss of anticoagulant activity (29). Additionally, conservative
mutation of GlaZ0to a D residue results in a complete loss of
antibody binding, and, from fluorescence analysis, a slightly
increased Cso value for production of the Ca2+-dependent
conformation of the Gla domain. Since Glam provides only
one of the five protein coordination sites for the internally
located Ca-5 (21), the slightly higher C50 needed for Ca2+to
induce the fluorescence alteration characteristic of the Ca2+dependent conformation of PC value may result from a slight
weakening of the Ca-5/PC interaction. More probably, however, since GlaZ0provides two of the threeprotein coordination
sites for Ca-6, the complete loss of activity that results upon
mutation of GlaZ0to a D residue suggests that Ca-6, a surfaceexposed ion, may be important for binding to phospholipid,
as was the case with Ca-1.
The Gla pair at positions 6 and 7 of PC (positions 7 and 8
of prothrombin, Fig. 4) possess activity dependencies similar
to thatseen for the Gla'9-Gla20pair. A previous investigation
demonstrated that a double mutation to a D-pair at these
positions resulted in a complete loss of anticoagulant activity
of APC (27), whichcouldbefully
explained by a single
mutation at Gla7 (29). Neither of these mutations have dramatic effects on Ca2+dependence of the fluorescence alteration of the resulting PC variants, but both prevent antibody
binding. Since Gla7 provides one of the five protein donor
sites for Ca-3 and one of the seven such sites for Ca-4 (21),
the lack of a strong conformational dependency of the Ca2+PC complex on Gla7is not surprising, since it is unlikely that
removal of Gla7 would greatly influence the binding of these
two internal Ca2+ions. The nearly complete loss of anticoagulant activity accompanying this mutation (29) maybe a
result of the fact that Gla7 provides two of the five protein
donor sites for Ca-2, which is partly exposed to the surface.
A weakening of the Ca-2/PC interaction, while not resulting
in a substantial conformational change, may affect the phospholipid binding that is needed for activity. The fact that
mutation of this residue results in loss of antibody binding
(Table 11) suggests that Gla7 may be important to binding to
the antibody, not as a resultof conformational maintenance,
but as anecessary contributory ligand to theantibody.
The most difficult explanation centers on the role of Gla6
in the structure-activity relationships of PC and APC. The
fact that this residue provides two of the five protein donor
sites for the internal Ca-5 (21) would suggest that it should
affect the fluorescence properties of the Ca2+/PCcomplex and
the Ca2+-dependent anticoagulantactivity of APC. The fact
that a mutation to a D residue at this site does not influence
these properties may indicate that a D residue could partly
substitute for Gla at this position. However, as with Gla7,the
Gla6-+ Asp mutation does eliminate antibody binding, again
perhaps as aresult of its direct andnecessary participation in
this binding event.
Mutation of Arg" also has profound effects on the structure
and activity of PC andAPC. A large Ca2+-dependentactivity
loss accompanies mutation of this residue (29), as well as a
loss of fluorescence change accompanying Ca2+binding (Table
I), and complete disruption of antibody binding (Table 11).
The explanation for this significant influence of Arg15may be
the result of the hydrogen bonding between the HH21 proton
ofArg" and the OE4 oxygen atom of the essential Gla16,
