We report here the molecular characterization of two galactosemia mutations, L74P and F171S,
and one polymorphism, S 135L, in human galactose-l-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT). Both galactosemia mutations result in reduced enzymatic activity when reconstructed in the cDNA and overexpressed.
The polymorphism, in contrast, has near normal activity. Both mutations affect evolutionarily conserved
residues, suggesting that they are functionally important, while the polymorphism occurs in a nonconserved
domain which is presumably not critical for enzymatic function. The F171S mutation is close to the putative
active-site nucleophile. Our data further support the notion of molecular heterogeneity of galactosemia
and suggest that galactosemia mutations and GALT polymorphisms may be useful tools in highlighting
different functional domains in human GALT.

ABSTRACT:

C l a s s i c galactosemia (McKusick 230400) results from deficiency of the ubiquitously expressed enzyme galactose- 1phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT;’ EC 2.7.7.12; Segal,
1989). Afflicted infants suffer from vomiting and diarrhea
after milk ingestion. If untreated, they will develop cataracts,
hepatosplenomegaly, failure to thrive, and Escherichia coli
sepsis. These symptoms can be avoided by placing patients
as soon as possible on a galactose-restricted diet (Segal, 1989).
Therefore, many U S . states and Western countries have instituted newborn screening programs. Unfortunately, most
well-treated patients will suffer from neurologic abnormalities
and ovarian failure (Waggoner et al., 1990). Galactosemia
is an autosomal recessive disorder with a frequency of about
1:60 000 newborns (Levy & Hammersen, 1978).
GALT catalyzes the conversion of galactose 1-phosphate
and uridine diphosphoglucose (UDPG) to uridine diphosphogalactose (UDP-gal) and glucose 1-phosphate. Its
absence in galactosemia results in elevated levels of galactose,
galactose l-phosphate, and other metabolites in the untreated
state (Segal, 1989). It is thought that these compounds result
in the early-onset complications which can be avoided by a
galactose-restricted diet. The late-onset symptoms may result
from a UDP-gal deficit first described by Kaufman et al.
(1988). This deficit is the direct result of a deficiency of
GALT and is reflected in subnormal galactosylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids (Dobie et al., 1990; Petry et al.,
1991).
Through the work of Frey and co-workers, much has been
learned about the E . coli enzyme. This enzyme, galT, undergoes a ping-pong reaction mechanism with a covalent uridylate reaction intermediate derived from UDPG (Frey et al.,
1982; Field et al., 1988). Furthermore, they were able to show

that the covalent uridylate intermediate is bound to E . coli
histidine-166 (Kim et al., 1990). It was proposed on the basis
of sequence similarities between the human, yeast, and E . coli
enzymes that they all use similar intermediates (Reichardt &
Berg, 1988b).
The molecular analysis of galactosemia began with the
cloning and characterization of a full-length, expressible GALT
cDNA (Reichardt & Berg, 1988a; Flach et al., 1990). Studies
of the GALT gene in galactosemic patients based on Southern
(Reichardt, 1989, 1991), Northern (Reichardt, 1989, 1991),
and Western blotting experiments (Banroques et al., 1983;
Reichardt, 1989, 1991) led to the suggestion that galactosemia
is caused predominantly by missense mutations (Reichardt,
1989, 1991). In fact, six disease-causing missense mutations
have been characterized to date (Reichardt & Woo, 1991;
Reichardt et al., 1991, 1992). Five of the mutations occurred
in evolutionarily conserved domains of GALT, suggesting that
the affected residues are of functional importance. Both
published polymorphisms, in contrast, affected variable residues (Reichardt & Woo, 1991). Therefore, it may be possible
to use the mutational analysis of human galactosemia to
analyze functional domains in human GALT. The large
number of different mutations causing galactosemia suggested
furthermore that this disease is heterogeneous at the molecular
level (Reichardt & Woo, 1991; Reichardt et al., 1991).
Here we report two galactosemia missense mutations, L74P
and F171S, that highlight functionally important domains of
the enzyme. The polymorphism, S135L, was found at a
variable position in GALT. It is noteworthy that the F171S
mutation occurs near the putative active-site nucleophile. Both
mutations result in severe losses of GALT specific activity

Finally, all three substitutions are rare among our patients.
These data further support the notion of molecular heterogeneity in galactosemia. Our data also suggest that galactosemia mutations will be a useful guide in a future rigorous
structurefunction analysis of human GALT by highlighting
important domains. Polymorphisms, in contrast, mark less
critical residues.

MATERIALS
AND METHODS
Cell Culture. Lymphoblastoid lines were established from
two galactosemic patients by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
transformation of lymphocytes obtained from whole blood
(Reichardt & Woo, 1991). Cells were grown in RPMI1640
(Hazleton, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 10%bovine serum
(HyClone, Logan, UT). Two cell lines were obtained, JR140
and 154. Patients were screened and diagnosed by a positive
newborn metabolite test and by assaying their red cell GALT
activity. They were identified through the New England
Regional Newborn Screening Program in Boston and have
been continuously followed on treatment. The GM2796 line
was obtained from the NIGMS Human Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). cos cells were grown in HGDMEM
supplemented with 10% bovine serum.
Amplificationand Sequencing. Cellular RNA was prepared
from log-phase cells by centrifugation through a CsCl cushion
(Chirgwin et al., 1979). Total cDNA libraries were synthesized from poly(A+) RNA and amplified exactly as described (Reichardt & Woo, 1991). The entire coding region
of GALT was amplified with 2.5 units of Tag DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) exactly as detailed elsewhere
(Reichardt & Woo, 1991). After gel purification to remove
the PCR primers, amplified products were directly sequenced
with Sequenase 2.0 (USB, Cleveland, OH) using internal
primers (Reichardt & Woo, 1991; Reichardt et al., 1991).
AS0 (Allele-Specific Oligonucleotide)Screening and Expression Analysis. 19mers spanning each mutation (ASI,
Pleasanton, CA; L74P, TCAACCCTCt/cGTGTCCTGG;
S135L, ACCCCTGGTc/tGGATGTAAC; F171S, TGCAGATCTt/cTGAAAACAA, upper case letters denote identical
bases, and lower case letters indicate mutant bases) were
labeled with [T-~~PIATP
(DuPont, Boston, MA) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB, Beverly, MA). These probes were
then hybridized to amplified cDNAs from 14 normal and 26
patient individuals (Reichardt & Woo,1991; Reichardt et al.,
1991,1992) overnight in 6X SSPE, 0.5% SDS, 1X Denhardt’s,
and 200 pg of denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42 OC. After
four washes at room temperature, a stringency wash was
performed at 63 OC in 3 M tetramethylammonium chloride
(Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI; Wood et al., 1985; Reichardt &
Woo, 1991), 0.5% SDS, 10 mM Tris, and 1 mM EDTA, pH
7.5, for 10 min.
Nucleotide substitutions were reconstructed for expression
analysis by site-directed mutagenesis with the same 19mers
in uracil-containing pJR16 (Reichardt & Woo,1991). Constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis in the relevant
region from rescued single-stranded DNA. Phagemid DNAs
were electroporated into cos cells and assayed for enzyme
activity and immunoreactive protein as described previously
72-h posttransfection (Reichardt & Woo,1991).
Computer Analysis. Mutant cDNA sequences were analyzed by the MAP algorithm as implemented by the Molecular
Biology Information Resource (MBIR; Baylor College of
Medicine). The default 252 restriction recognition sites were
loaded.

denote the position of each substitution. Panel A is the L74P substitution (found in cell line JR140), panel B shows the S135L substitution, and panel C is the F171S substitution (both of these two
substitutions were found in cell line JR154). The sequence in panel
C was obtained from the antisense strand.

RESULTS
Mutation Identification. We sequenced amplified cDNA
derived from two galactosemic cell lines, JR140 and 154,
directly to control for possible PCR (polymerase chain reaction) artifacts and found them to be compound heterozygotes
for the common Q188R mutation (data not shown; Reichardt
et al., 1991). Three additional substitutions were identified:
(1) a T to C transition of nucleotide 249 resulting in the
replacement of leucine-74 with proline in JR 140 (L74P;
Figure 1A); (2) a C to T transition at base pair 432 substituting serine-135 with leucine (S135L; Figure 1B); (3) a T
to C transition of nucleotide 540 replacing phenylalanine-171
with serine (F171S; Figure 1C). These last two substitutions
were found in line JR154.
Expression Analysis. We reconstructed each substitution
by sitedirected mutagenesis in the expression phagemid pJRl6
which allows for high-level expression of human GALT in cos
monkey cells (Reichardt & Woo, 1991). Introduction of the
normal and mutant constructs resulted in a 15-3 1-fold overexpression of immunoreactive protein of the expected size
(Table I and data not shown). It is noteworthy that all three
substitutions produced near normal amounts of immunoreactive protein when compared to the normal construct,
pJR16 (Table I). However, the mutant polypeptides encoded
different specific activities (Table I). The L74P mutation (in

pJR31) was found to have no detectable GALT activity while
the F171S mutation (in pJR27) resulted in about 7% of the
normal specific activity when overexpressed (Table I). In
contrast, the S135L substitution (in pJR26) produced near
normal levels of enzymatic activity.
Mutation Frequency. We screened our panel of 14 normal
and 26 galactosemic cDNAs by allele-specificoligonucleotide
(ASO) hybridization to determine the frequency of each
substitution (Reichardt & Woo, 1991; Reichardt et al., 1991,
1992). All three GALT mutations are rare: the L74P mutation was found only in the patient we sequenced while the
S135L polymorphism and F171S were both also found in a
second patient cell line, GM2796, which was obtained from
an African-American patient (Table 11).
Restriction Sites Altered by GALT Mutations. We analyzed all three substitutions for possible alterations of restriction sites by the MAP algorithm. None of the substitutions reported here are predicted to alter any common sites
in the cDNA.
Homology Analysis. We compared the sequences surrounding all three substitutions in the homologous enzymes
galT from E . coli (Lemaire & Mueller-Hill, 1986), GAL7
from bakers' yeast (Tajima et al., 1985), and GALT from
humans (Flach et al., 1990). These three organisms are
representativesof such distantly related groups as prokaryotes,
unicellular eukaryotes, and multicellular eukaryotes, and the
overall sequence identity for the three enzymes is only 35%.
Leucine-74 is conserved in all three species and is flanked by
an equally well-conserved cysteine, and three amino acids
downstream, a conserved glycine is found (Figure 2). Phenylalanine- 171 is in an even more impressively conserved
domain: it is again conserved in all three species, and the six
surrounding residues are identical in yeast GAL7 and only one
of them is missing in E. coli galT (Figure 2). In contrast, there
is only spotty homology surrounding leucine- 135, and the

al., 1990; Reichardt et al., 1992).

DISCUSSION
We report here three amino acid substitutions in human
galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase found in cell lines
derived from two classic galactosemia patients. We sought
to categorize these substitutions by expression analysis: two
are disease-causing galactosemia mutations since the L74P
and F171S mutations result in dramatic losses of GALT activity (Table I). In contrast, the S135L substitution is a
polymorphism because it encodes normal GALT specific activity. The three GALT mutations reported here are all of
the missense type, supporting the hypothesis of a preponderance of missense mutations in galactosemia (Banroques et al.,
1983; Reichardt, 1989, 1991). All three substitutions are rare
(Table 11). Thus, these data confirm our hypothesis that
galactosemia is heterogeneous at the molecular level (Reichardt & Woo, 1991; Reichardt et al., 1991, 1992). Future
studies on genotype-phenotype correlations will address a
possible relationship between galactosemia mutations and
biochemical phenotype. This kind of analysis proved very
rewarding in the case of phenylketonuria (PKU; Okano et al.,
1991).
The CpG dinucleotideis a hot spot for mutations in humans
because they can undergo oxidative deamination of 5methylcytosines (Cooper & Youssouffian, 1988). Two CpG
mutations, R148W (Reichardt et al., 1992) and R333W
(Reichardt et al., 1991), have been reported in galactosemia.
Here we report a third substitution that could have arisen by
oxidative deamination of a cytosine in a CpG dinucleotide: the
S135L polymorphism (cf. Figure 1B). Thus, 3 of 11 reported
GALT mutations, galactosemia mutations, and polymorphisms
occurred at CpG dinucleotides. These three GALT mutations
follow the rules predicted for deamination of 5-methylcytosine
since they are all C to T transitions (Cooper & Youssouffian,
1988). It is noteworthy that one of the two galactosemia
mutations reported here, L74P, creates a new CpG dinucleotide.
The "Black" variant of galactosemia, commonly found in
African-American patients, is characterized by a substantial
residual capability to metabolize galactose (Segal, 1989). In
this context, it is interesting that the F171S mutation which
was found in a cell line derived from an Irish-American individual (JR154) and has detectable residual activity (Table

Galactosemia Mutations
I) also occurs in a line obtained from an African-American
patient (GM2796). It could be either an ancestral mutation
predating divergence of the races or a recurring mutation or
be the result of genetic admixture which accounts for about
onethird of all genetic markers in African-Americans (Reed,
1969). We favor the latter hypothesis since the F171S mutation appears to be cosegregating with the S135L polymorphism and, therefore, could be linked. Further characterization
of African-American patients will examine these issues.
The overall amino acid sequence identity between human
GALT (Flach et al., 1990), yeast GAL7 (Tajima et al., 1985),
and E. coli galT (Lemaire & Mueller-Hill, 1986) is only about
35%. We had previously found that most galactosemia mutations occur in evolutionarily conserved domains, suggesting
that they are of functional importance (Reichardt & Woo,
1991; Reichardt et al., 1991, 1992). In contrast, polymorphisms were found in variable areas, suggesting that they were
less critical (Reichardt & Woo, 1991). The two mutations
and one polymorphism reported here confirm this hypothesis
since both mutations, L74P and F171S, occur in conserved
domains while the polymorphism, S135L, affects a variable
area (Figure 2). Furthermore, the F171S galactosemia mutation is located in proximity of the putative active-site nucleophile human histidine-186 (Reichardt et al., 1992). This
is the third mutation affecting a residue in proximity of the
proposed active-site nucleophile. The other two are the previously described Q188R and L195P mutations (Reichardt et
al., 1991, 1992). Thus, galactosemia mutations highlight
functionally important domains while GALT polymorphisms
occur in less critical areas. It had been proposed that conserved
patches of amino acid sequence identity might be helpful in
structurefunction considerations (Reichardt & Berg, 1988b),
and our experience with the molecular analysis of galactosemia
seems to support this proposition. Therefore, the molecular
characterization of galactosemia mutations and GALT polymorphisms will provide valuable insights for a future rigorous
biochemical structurefunction analysis of human GALT.
This study will involve an enzymologic examination of the
reaction mechanism of the human enzyme in relation to
functional domains of the GALT polypeptide. Mechanistic
studies of the E . coli galT enzyme (Frey et al., 1982; Field
et al., 1989; Kim et al., 1990) and delineation of functional
domains in human GALT through an exhaustive analysis of
patients will provide the necessary framework for this project.
In summary, we report here the molecular characterization
of two novel galactosemia mutations, L74P and F171S, and
one GALT polymorphism, S135L. Our data support the
proposition that disease-causing mutations highlight functionally important residues while polymorphisms mark less
critical amino acids. A similar pattern has been described in
hemophilia B caused by factor IX deficiency (Bottema et al.,
1991). Thus, we propose that the mutational analysis of galactosemia will provide some of the information necessary to
begin a biochemical dissection of human GALT.
