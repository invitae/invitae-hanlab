SUMMARY
A new a-chain abnormal haemoglobin variant, Haemoglobin Denmark Hill, has
been found in a West Indian woman and also her baby daughter. The haemoglobin
migrates more slowly towards the anode than Haemoglobin A on electrophoresis at
pH 8.6 although it has a "neutral" mutation, a95 (G2) Pro-Ala. The mutation is at
the same site as in two other haemoglobin variants, Haemoglobin G Georgia a95 (G2)
Pro-Leu, and Haemoglobin Rampa a95 (G2) Pro-Ser which also show a reduced
electrophoretie mobility. The amino acid substitution is at the alfi ~ interface and can
therefore be expected to affect the oxygen-binding properties. Haemoglobin Denmark
Hill has an increased oxygen affinity, a reduced haem haem interaction and a somewhat reduced Bohr effect.

INTRODUCTION
The new haemoglobin variant described here was found at King's College
Hospital Annexe in Denmark Hill, South London. It was discovered during a routine
analysis by cellulose acetate electrophoresis at pH 8.6 (Graham and Grunbaum 1) of a
haemolysate from a pregnant West Indian woman aged 3 ° years. Both haemoglobin
(Hb) A and Hb A 2 were accompanied by slower moving variants. She showed no evidence nor history of anaemia or of any other abnormality which might be attributed
to the abnormal haemoglobin. At the 36th week of her pregnancy her haemoglobin
level was ~2 g/Ioo ml, 3.94" lO6 red cells per #1 with a mean corpuscular volume of 87
fl, and mean corpuscular haemoglobin of 3° pg.
The pregnancy followed a normal course without complications, and she was
delivered of a daughter who had inherited the abnormal haemoglobin; a small
quantity of fast moving haemoglobin in the position of Hb Bart's was also noted.

Hybridisation of the abnormal haemoglobin with canine haemoglobin was
carried out by the method of Huehns et al. 6, and starch-gel electrophoresis of the
separated chains by the method of Chernoff and PettitL
The abnormal haemoglobin was isolated by c h r o m a t o g r a p h y on Sephadex CM5o and further purified by repeated discontinuous paper electrophoresisL Globin was
prepared b y precipitation with acid acetone at - - 2 0 °C and the g- and fl-chains were
separated b y c h r o m a t o g r a p h y on c a r b o x y m e t h y l cellulose ( W h a t m a n CM23) in 8 I~1
urea buffers using a linear gradient from o.oo5 to o.o5 M Na2HPO 4 at p H 6.7 (Clegg
et al.S). The eluting buffer had a higher concentration of Na2HPO4 than the usual
o.o3 M in order to ensure that the abnormal a-chain was eluted from the colunm;
however, the abnormal t~-chains were eluted at the same position as normal a-chains.
The pooled fractions containing the a- or the fl-chains were allowed to react with
ethyleneimine and the protein was isolated by freeze-drying after removal of urea and
salts b y gel filtration on a column of Sephadex G-25 (coarse) equilibrated with o.5°,0
formic acid in water. Fingerprints of tryptic digests of the aminoethylated a- and fichains were prepared (Sick el al. 9) and stained with ninhydrin and reagents for specific
amino acids. The core of the aminoethylated a-chain was washed with buffer, p H 6. 4,
and water and then digested with pepsin in 0.05 .X'IHC1 at 37 °C for 5 h. Fingerprints
of the peptic digest of the "core" were prepared in a similar manner to the fingerprints
of tryptic digests except that electrophoresis was carried out at p H 3.5Biochim. Biopkys. Acta, e78 (t07e) 459 464

For amino acid analysis the peptides were eluted from lightly stained preparative fingerprints with 6 M HC1 and hydrolysed in sealed tubes at Io8 °C for 24 or 48 h.
The hydrolysates, after removal of the HC1 ira vacuo, were analysed on a Locarte
Amino Acid Analyser. Peptides which were electrically neutral at pH 6. 4 were purified
by electrophoresis at pH 3.5 before analysis. In order to determine the sequence of the
first residues of the mutant peptide it was eluted with o. 5 M NH4OH, and then
degraded by the Dansyl-Edman technique (Grayl°).
To determine the oxygen affinity of Hb Denmark Hill, HI) A and the abnormal
haemoglobin were separated in the carbonmonoxy forms by chronmtography on CMSephadex. The haemolysate was treated with sodium dithionite in the presence of CO
to reduce methaemoglobin before it was applied to the column. The pooled fractions
containing the Hb A and Hb Denmark Hill were concentrated to about IO% by ultrafiltration. The haemoglobin solutions were equilibrated with o.o 5 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.6, by gel filtration on a small column (i cm × 8 cm) Sephadex G-25
coarse beads, and adjusted to a concentration of 2-5°..o (w/v)i The carbonmonoxy
haemoglobin was converted to oxyhaemoglobin by illmnination of the solutions in a
rotating tonometer filled with oxygen (Kilmartin and Rossi-Bernardin).
The oxygen dissociation curves were determined using a continuous recording
apparatus (Imai e~t al. 12,1a) constructed by Professor H. Morimoto. Measurements were
performed on 6-ml lots of o.I~o haemoglobin solution in o.I M potassium phosphate
buffers of various pH values containing o.5 mM EDTA, The measurements were made
at a temperature of 2o °C using light of wavelength 488 nm. The concentration of the
methaenloglobin before and after each measurement was estimated from the ratio of
the absorbance at 576 and 5o8 nm.
RESULTS

Structure of Hb Denmark Hill
The amount of abnormal haemoglobin was estimated to be 19/o
o/ of the total by
means of the separation on Sephadex CM-5o.
The methods which did separate the abnormal haemoglobin also revealed a
second Hb A2, which migrated just behind Hb A 2 on paper and cellulose acetate. This
suggested that the haemoglobin differed from Hb A in its a-chain, thereby forming
variants of both Hb A (a2Xj32) and Hb A 2 (a2x@. This was further corroborated by
dissociation of the haemoglobin and recombination with canine haemoglobin. Starchgel electrophoresis of the mixture of hybrid haemoglobins revealed a n c~2human/~2 canine
hybrid with a lower electrophoretie mobility than normal.
Starch-gel electrophoresis of the globin chains in 6 M urea did not show a
variant a-chain with an electrophoretic mobility different from that o f a A chains. This
suggested that the difference between the variant and Hb A might be due to a neutral
nmtation which did not affect the electrophoretic mobility of the a-chain after
unfolding in 6 M urea, but did affect the mobility of the intact tetramer in some
electrophoretic systems. The fingerprint of the tryptic digests of the aminoethylated
e- and fi-chains and of the peptic digest of the a-chain core did not show any obvious
at)normalities. It was therefore necessary to analyse all the tryptic peptides of the achain. It was found that one of these peptides a T p X I (g 93-99) (Gerald and Ingram 1~)
differed from normal in having no proline and having instead one residue of alanine

haemoglobin has a higher oxygen affinity. The values of n, the Hills constant, (2. 41.8) were also lower than normal, indicating a reduced haem haem interaction. However, the value of n for the Hb A fraction itself was somewhat lower (2.6) than the
value normally obtained (3.o). This m a y be a consequence of the rather large amounts
of methaemoglobin in the solutions.
A plot of logl0P ~ against p H gives a measure of the Bohr effect as the slope of
the curve gives the value of d - - logloPUdpH. When the data were plotted in this way
it was found that the slope of the curve for H b Denmark Hill was less steep than that
for Hb A indicating that the Bohr effect was somewhat reduced. It was difficult to
estimate this effect accurately owing to the uncertainty of the value of logP~ at the
highest pH.
DISCUSSION

The abnormality of H b Denmark Hill occurs in an important interface of the
tetramer; the al/32 contact (Perutz et al. 15) in which, besides others, six consecutive
residues of the a-chain are involved, FG 3-5 and G 1-3 (a91-96). In the deoxy structure FG4, FG5, GI and G2 are in contact with tryptophan fl37 (C3) of the/3~ chain,
while in the oxy structure FG4, GI and G2 are in contact with the tryptophan. Two
other haemoglobins which have substitutions at a95 (G2) have been described. They
are H b G Georgia a6 a95 (G2) Pro-Leu, and H b R a m p a 17 a95 (G2) Pro-Ser. Both have
reduced electrophoretic mobility at p H 8.6 despite having neutral mutations. As mutations at this site would be expected to interfere with the structure of the interface, it
is not surprising that both Hb G Georgia and Hb R a m p a show altered oxygen affinities ;
both haemoglobins having decreased h a e m - h a e m interactions and increased oxygen
affinities (Smith et al?S).
Perutz has shown by model building that the introduction of the polar serine
residue in H b R a m p a would cause a disturbance of the structure of the al/32 interface
and permit water to enter this cleft. However, in Hb Denmark Hill the change is from
proline to alanine, which would only slightly affect the hydrophobic properties of this
region. The side chain of alanine, a methyl group, is much less bulky than the side
chain of proline which consists of the three methylene groups of the pyrrolidine ring.
Two atoms of the proline are in contact with six atoms of tryptophan/537 (C3) in the
