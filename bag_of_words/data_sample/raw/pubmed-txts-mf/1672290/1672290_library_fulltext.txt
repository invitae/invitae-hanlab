By direct sequence analysis of 94 mutant phenylalanine
hydroxylase
alleles using polymerase chain reaction-based
techniques, we identified a C to T transition
in exon 7 of the
human phenylalanine
hydroxylase
gene that is associated
with RFLP haplotypes 1 and 4. A leucine for proline substitution at position 281 can be predicted from the nucelotide
sequence of the mutant codon. Expression analysis in cultured mammalian
cells after site-directed
mutagenesis
proved that the base substitution
is a disease causing gene
lesion. Dot-blot hybridization
analysis using allele-specific
oligonucleotides
revealed that 25% of all mutant haplotype
1 alleles in the German population
hear this mutation. In
addition,
this mutation
could be detected on one mutant
haplotype 4 allele. The fact that this mutation is associated
with only 25% of all mutant haplotype
1 alleles suggests
that multiple mutations may be associated with this haplotype. The occurrence of several different mutations would
be in agreement with the clinical heterogeneity
observed in
the group of patients whose PKU alleles belong to haplotype 1. c 1991 Academic Press, Inc.

INTRODUCTION

Classical phenylketonuria
(PKU), the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism, results
from the absence or reduced activity of the liver enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which leads
to hyperphenylalaninemia
(HPA). Mental retardation and neurological abnormalities are prominent
features of the disease (for reviews, see Striver et al.,
1988, 1989). Early detection (Guthrie test) and treatment with a phenylalanine-restricted
diet essentially
prevent severe mental retardation as a consequence
of the disease. Despite efficient and early treatment,
however, many affected children still have learning
disabilities and develop psychological and emotional
difficulties (Levy and Waisbren, 1987).

At least 46 distinct PAH chromosomal haplotypes
(HT) have been observed in European populations
(Woo, 1988). Interestingly, only 4 of these 46 haplotypes (HT l-4) account for more than 80% of all mutant alleles in Europeans (Daiger et al., 1989). Molecular analysis has uncovered a tight association of mutant haplotype 2 and 3 alleles with two specific
mutations, providing strong evidence for linkage disequilibrium (DiLella et a/., 1986, 1987; Marvit et al.,
1987). Both mutations have been proven to be the
disease causing molecular lesions. All patients who
are either homozygotes or compound heterozygotes
for these particular mutations are affected by severe
PKU (Giittler et al., 1987). However, hyperphenylalaninemia of varying severity has been documented in
patients who do not have mutant haplotypes 2 and/or
3 and the associated mutations. The disorder in patients not carrying these particular haplotypes with
the associated mutations very often is characterized
by a large heterogeneity with respect to the phenotype. This clinical heterogeneity, which is probably
due to varying levels of residual enzyme activity, suggests the existence of multiple mutations at the PAH
locus.
Recently, a number of additional mutations in the
PAH gene have been described (Lichter-Konecki
et
al., 1988; Abadie et al., 1989; Dworniczak et al., 1989;
John et al., 1989: Lyonnet et al., 1989; Wang et al.,
1989; Okano et al., 1990). At least two of these are in
linkage disequilibrium with haplotype 1 and 4 alleles
in European populations (Abadie et al., 1989; Dworniczak et al., 1989; Okano et al., 1990). Since the association between any of the reported mutations and
haplotypes 1 and 4 is only partial, a heterogeneity of
molecular defects linked to these two haplotypes can
be predicted. In the present paper, we report a new
frequent missense mutation that is linked to haplotypes 1 and 4 in the German population and that
causes severe PKU.

MATERIALS

AND

METHODS

Patients
Forty-seven unrelated German families with at
least one child affected by HPA were investigated; 40
patients have classical PKU, 4 patients have mild
PKU, and 3 patients have non-PKU HPA, according
to the criteria of Striver et al. (1989). Haplotype analysis of these families has previously been reported (Aulehla-Scholz et al., 1988).
Isolation and Characterization of Genomic
DNA Clones
Genomic DNA clones covering the complete human PAH gene were isolated from a bacteriophage X
EMBL3 library (Clontech Laboratories) by use of the
full-length PAH cDNA probe that has kindly been
provided by S. L. C. Woo (Kwok et al., 1985). Identification and further characterization of exon-containing restriction fragments were performed according to
standard procedures (Sambrook et al., 1989). At least
300 bp of intronic sequence flanking each exon was
determined.
Amplification and Direct DNA Sequencing
of Eron 7 Region
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and preparation of single-stranded templates were performed according to the procedure described by Spiegelberg et
al. (1989). Amplification primers used were AP 287
and AP 423. Single strands resulted from reamplification using identical primers in a ratio of 1:50 (AP
287:AP 423). Unlabeled AP 287, AP 423, or the exonspecific oligonucleotide SP 429 served as sequencing
primer (Fig. 1).
Dot-Blot Hybridization
fa) DNA.
One microliter of the PCR reaction
diluted into 50 ~1TE buffer was added to 250 ~1denaturing solution (0.4 N NaOH, 25 mM Na,EDTA).
This mixture was transferred directly onto Biodyne
transfer membrane (Pall, Glen Cove, NY) using a microsample filtration
manifold device. Resultant
filters were processed and analyzed by hybridization
with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes (normal
probe: 5’-CGAACCGTGAGTACTGTCCT,
sense
DNA strand; mutant probe: 5’-AGGACAGTACTCACAGTTCG, antisense DNA strand) as described elsewhere (Saiki et al., 1986).
(b) RNA. Total cellular RNA was isolated by
the guanidium thiocyanide method of Chirgwin et al.
(1979) and extensively digested with DNase I. Sample
and filter preparation, prehybridization, and hybridization using a 32P-labeled PAH cDNA probe were

performed according to Sambrook et al. (1989). After
hybridization, filters were washed twice in 2X SSC,
0.1% SDS at room temperature and twice in 0.1X
SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 60°C.
Site-Directed Mutagenesis of PAH cDNA
Specific base substitution was generated in a PAH
cDNA fragment by site-directed mutagenesis in the
plasmid pDR/PAH-n according to a modified procedure described by Nelson and Long (1989). Plasmid
pDR/PAH-n was constructed by introducing the entire coding sequence of the PAH cDNA starting at the
SmaI site 11 bp 5’ to the start codon ATG and the
complete 3’.untranslated
region int,o the blunted
BamHI cloning site of bacterial expression vector
pDR540 (Pharmacia). Oligonucleotides used for in uitro mutagenesis by PCR are listed in Table 1. In the
first amplification reaction a 67-bp DNA fragment
was generated using primer A, which introduced the
mutation; primer B; and PAH cDNA as template.
The fragment was gel-purified and utilized as primer
in a second amplification reaction with PAH cDNA
as template. This reaction was run as a single cycle of
2 min at 93”C, 1 min at 5O”C, and 10 min at 72°C.
After addition of primers C and D, 30 additional cycles (40 s, 93°C; 40 s, 50°C; 90 s, 72°C) were carried
out. The expected 706-bp fragment was gel-purified
and digested sequentially with ApI1 and BamHI, resulting in a 474-bp restriction fragment (position
1036-1510 of PAH cDNA). This fragment was cloned
into A~II/BamHI-digested
plasmid pDR/PAH-n following standard procedures. The resulting plasmid
was named pDR/PAH-m281.
For expression studies
in monkey COS cells, the respective restriction fragments were cloned into the eukaryotic expression
vector pSVL (Pharmacia). This construct was designated pSVL/PAH-n
or pSVL/PAH-m281.
DNA sequence analysis revealed that except for the mutagenized site no further mutation was introduced by PCR
or cloning.

pSVL-vector
and 500 pg DEAE-dextran
(mol wt,

medium containing chloroquine diphosphate (final
concentration, 80 PM) was added. After 2.5 h the cells
were treated with DMSO shock medium for 150 s
(Lopata et al., 1984). The DMSO medium was discarded, and the cells were washed twice with PBS and

268 bp was obtained from amplification of the exon 7
region. Amplified DNA was electrophoresed on agarose gels to confirm the size of the expected band.
Direct sequencing of single-stranded DNA templates,
obtained from unbalanced amplification, confirmed
that this fragment contained exon 7.
Identification of the Missense Mutation
in the PAH Gene
For rapid screening all 94 PKU alleles under investigation were analyzed simultaneously. To facilitate
sequence analysis, the A, C, G, and T sequencing reaction products were electrophoretically analyzed separately on four 6% acrylamide gels. With this approach
mutations can be identified easily by appearance of
additional signals within a specific sequence ladder
compared to all others (data not shown). This analysis revealed that 7 of 94 PKU alleles showed an additional T caused by a C - T transition at the second
base of codon 281 (nucleotide 1064 in PAH cDNA
(Kwok et al., 1985)), resulting in substitution of Pro
(CCT) by Leu (CTT). The mutation was confirmed
by sequencing single-stranded PCR products that had
been amplified independently. All seven patients are
heterozygous for this mutation. Amplification of genomic DNA by PCR enriches both the mutant and the
normal exon 7 sequence. Direct sequencing of this
template mixt.ure therefore results in compound sequence ladders as shown in Fig. 2.
Association of the Missense Mutation
with Haplotypes 1 and 4
Direct sequence analysis of exon 7 of the parental
PKU alleles showed that six mutant haplotype 1 alleles and one mutant haplotype 4 allele bear this particular mutation (data not shown). To confirm linkage disequilibrium between this mutation and mutant
haplotypes 1 and 4, dot-blot hybridization analysis
using allele-specific oligonucleotide probes was performed (Fig. 3A). This investigation demonstrated
that except for the mutant alleles already mentioned,

Expression

Analysis

To investigate whether this missense mutation
causes PKU in affected patients, expression studies
in mammalian cells and bacteria were carried out.
The mutation was introduced into the normal PAH
cDNA in eukaryotic and prokaryotic expression vectors by site-directed mutagenesis. For analyzing expression in mammalian cells, monkey COS cells were
transfected with the respective constructs in a transient expression assay. After 72 h of culturing, t.he
cells were harvested and crude extracts subjected to
further analysis.
-Testing the enzymatic activity of the product of the
cotransfected CAT reporter gene demonstrated that

ET

AL

gene transfer efficiency was identical in all experiments (data not shown).
-The PAH activity assay showed that extracts from
cells transfected with pSVL/PAH-n
were able to convert [14C]phenylalanine into [14C]tyrosine, whereas
extracts from cells transfected with pSVL/PAH-281
did not exhibit any activity (Fig. 4A).
-Dot-blot
analysis of serially diluted total RNA samples showed identical steady-state levels of the normal or mutant mRNA present in transfected cells
(Fig. 4B).
-Western blot analysis utilizing polyclonal antibodies against human PAH revealed complete absence of
immunoreactive
PAH, whereas extracts of cells
transfected with the normal cDNA containing expression vector displayed a protein band at about 50
kDa that comigrates with the authentic protein synthesized in human liver. Even on heavily overloaded
gels (400 pg protein/lane) PAH protein was not detectable in cells t.ransfected with the mutated cDNA
clone (Fig. 4C).
Expression analysis in bacteria confirmed the results obtained in t.he mammalian system. No residual
PAH enzymatic activity was detectable in crude extract,s of bacteria transformed with the mutated
cDNA containing expression vector (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
We report the characterization of a new PAH mutat,ion associated with haplotypes 1 and 4 in the German population. The mutation is characterized by a
nucelotide substitution in exon 7 of the PAH gene and
results in a Pro2” + Leu2” amino acid exchange. Expression studies in mammalian cells as well as in bacteria showed t.hat phenylalanine hydroxylase activity
is completely abolished by this mutation. Western
blot analysis demonstrated that the absence of detectable activity is due to the absence of immunoreactive
PAH prot.ein, although normal amounts of PAH
mRNA are produced in cells transfected with respective expression vectors. It can be speculated that the
mutation in codon 281 causesan unstable PAH molecule that is rapidly degraded within the cells. It is very
unlikely that the structurally altered protein is nonimmunoreactive because the antiserum recognizes
multiple epitopes of PAH and is able to detect even
subfragments of the enzyme.
To correlate the in vitro findings with the in uiuo
effect of the mutation, the clinical data of the patients
who carried the missense mutation in codon 281 were
reexamined. All patients exhibit classical PKU, although with differing severity (Table 2). In our panel
of patients no individual is homozygous for this mutation. In two cases(Patients 14 and 33) the mutation
in the second mutant allele is unknown. Three pa-

tients (18, 20, 26) are compound heterozygotes;
the
second allele carries the Argz61 --, Glnz61 missense
mutation recently described by Okano et al. (1990).
These patients exhibit a mild form of PKU. This is
probably due to the residual enzymatic activity in the
liver of these patients resulting from the PKU allele
that bears the mutation in codon 261. This amino acid
substitution
obviously does not have a profound effect
on PAH activity because patients who are homozygous for this lesion exhibit a very mild form of PKU
(own data; Okano et al., 1990). Two patients are compound heterozygotes
for Prozal + Let?** and either
Arg408 --* Trp40s (Patient 39) or Arg15’ - Gln15’ (Patient 56). The latter mutations
are known to cause

classical PKU. The clinical findings in Patient 56
provide evidence that the missense mutation in codon
281 impairs enzymatic activity drastically because he
showed high serum phenylalanine
levels before dietary treatment
(Table 2).
Direct sequencing and dot-blot hybridization
analysis of normal and mutant PAH alleles of all haplotypes present
in the German population
demonstrated a linkage disequilibrium
between this mutation and mutant haplotypes 1 and 4. About 25% of all
mutant haplotype 1 alleles (6 of 25) bear this particular mutation, whereas only one haplotype 4 allele (1 of
28) shows this nucleotide substitution.
These data
demonstrate
that in contrast to mutant haplotypes 2

198

DWORNICZAK

and 3, haplotypes 1 and 4 are associated with several
different mutations.
This has been suggested earlier
by correlation
of phenotypic
and genotypic data of
various patients
exhibiting
heterogeneous
clinical
manifestations
(Lichter-Konecki
et al., 1988).
Two further aspects concerning the possible origin
and effect of the mutation of the second base of codon
281 should be added. First, nucleotide 1064 is part of a
CpG dinucleotide (the G is the first base of intron 7)
and the mutation results in a CG - TG transition.
Reports of point mutations
causing genetic diseases
in humans show that at least 35% occur within CpG
doublets (Cooper and Youssoufian,
1988). Mutations
of this type are thought to be due t.o an accidental
deamination of a 5-methylcytosine,
leading to a transition to thymines (Coulondre et al., 1978; Wang et al.,
1982). Our results provide further evidence that the
CpG sequence motif is a mutation hot spot in the human PAH gene, as already suggested by Abadie et al.
(1989). Second, the mutation affects the exon/intron

splice site. The role of specific bases in the splicing of
higher eukaryotic pre-mRNAs has been extensively
studied and systematic analysis of known RNA splice
function sequencesof eukaryotic protein coding genes
confirmed the Chambon rule that the S- and 3’.splice
sites conform to consensus sequences (Breathnach
and Chambon, 1981). Mutations at these sites frequently abolish normal splicing and there are several
examples in which alterations at the splice donor site
result in skipping of the preceding exon (DiLella et al.,
1986; Weil et al., 1988). Until now, only very few mutations have been reported in exon residues of 5’.
splice sites (Chehab et al., 1987; Vidaud et al., 1989),
whereas several point mutations have been detected
in intronic residues (Shapiro and Senapathy, 1987;
DiLella ef at., 1986). Whether the reported mutation
has functional consequences with respect to splicing
remains to be investigated. Our present. findings suggest that if the transcript is spliced correctly, the stability of the mRNA is comparable to normal and
translation results in a protein that is catalytically
inactive.
