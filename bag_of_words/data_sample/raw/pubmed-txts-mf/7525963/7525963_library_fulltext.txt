patients
F Chevalier-Porst, A M Bonardot, R Gilly, J P Chazalette, M Mathieu, D Bozon
Abstract
The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene of 600
unrelated cystic fibrosis (CF) patients
living in France (excluding Brittany) was
screened for 105 different mutations.
This analysis resulted in the identification of 86% of the CF alleles and complete
genotyping of 76% of the patients. The
most frequent mutations in this population after AF508 (69% of the CF chromosomes) are G542X (3-3%), N1303K (1P8%),
W1282X (1P5%), 1717-lG-.A (1P3%),
2184delA+2183 A-+G (0 9%), and R553X
(0-8%).

The gene involved in cystic fibrosis (CF), the
most common genetic disease among white
populations, has been isolated and sequenced.'-3
The protein encoded by this gene, named cystic
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR), contains 1480 amino acids, has two
membrane associated domains, two ATP binding folds (NBF), and a large highly charged
domain (R) containing phosphorylation sites
for protein kinases A and C. The most common
mutation responsible for CF is a deletion, in
exon 10 (first NBF domain), of a triplet coding
for a phenylalanine at position 508 (AF508) of
the CFTR protein. This mutation has been
found with an overall frequency of 68% but
with marked variation in populations of different geographical origin.4 Further genetic
studies have identified more than 300 different
mutations in this gene (Cystic Fibrosis Genetic
Analysis Consortium (CFGAC)).s
In this study a panel of 105 mutations'"5 has
been tested on a sample of 600 unrelated CF
patients living mostly in the eastern part of
France, where ethnic heterogeneity is an
important factor. Identification of the most
frequent mutations in a given population is
essential for genetic diagnosis and carrier risk
assessment.

Material and methods
SAMPLE COMPOSITION

Mutation analysis was performed on 600 unrelated CF patients and their families. The diagnosis of CF was made on the basis of at least
two positive sweat tests and on clinical findings.
This CF population is composed mostly of
patients of French origin (about 87%) but also
of mixed European origin and North African

origin (Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco).

METHODS

Fourteen exons of the CFTR gene and their
flanking intron-exon junctions were amplified
according to Zielenski et al'6 from genomic
DNA. Methods used to detect mutations are:
(1) heteroduplex formation followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE),'7 (2)
allele specific oligonucleotide hybridisation
(ASO), (3) restriction enzyme digestion showing created or abolished sites. Mutations
detected by the abolition of a restriction enzyme
site were confirmed by ASO. (4) PCR with
modified primers followed by restriction enzyme digestion.'819
Haplotype analysis with marker/enzyme
pairs XV2C/TaqI and KM19/PstI were performed and are named A, B, C, and D according to Estivill et alP0 when the phase in the
family is known.

Results
THE

AF508 MUTATION

The CFTR gene analysis presented here shows
that among the 1200 CF chromosomes tested,
827 (69%) carry the AF508 mutation and 373
(31%) carry another mutation: 310 patients
(51-5%) are AF508 homozygotes, 207 patients
(34 5%) are compound heterozygotes for
AF508 and another mutation, and 83 patients
(14%) have two other mutations.
SCREENING FOR OTHER MUTATIONS

The 104 other mutations tested are located in
14 different PCR products corresponding to 14
exons and their splice junctions. At the beginning of this work, the choice of regions to study
was influenced by the number of mutations
described and their frequency. Then with the
rapid increase in the number of mutations identified, the choice was influenced by the origin of
the population.
Among the 104 other CFTR mutations
tested on the 373 non-AF508 CF chromosomes,
none of the following 58 mutations were found:

In exon 10, a C to G substitution at nucleotide

chromosome, a particular pattern when exon 10

sequencing of the PCR product of exon 20 from
this patient showed a G to A substitution at
nucleotide 3980 changing an arginine at position 1283 into a lysine (R1283K) (fig 2). It has
not been established if R1283K is a disease
causing mutation as the arginine at this position
is not conserved in the related proteins.'
R1283K can be detected by two different restriction enzyme digestions: abolition of the
MnlI site or creation of an MboII site giving a
pattern similar to G1244E on agarose gel electrophoresis.2' The presence of this new mutation highlights the necessity of verification by
ASO hybridisation for mutations detected by
abolition of a restriction enzyme site.
We also identified four other mutations
which have already been reported, a nonsense
mutation in exon 4 (Y122X)22 and three
frameshift mutations in exon 13, 1918delGC,
2118del4, and 2372del8.2'
This study underlines some other factors.
The identification of R334W in two affected
sibs and the study of the segregation of this
mutation through the family showed that the
mother, without a history of CF, was homozygous for R334W. Further clinical investigations
showed that she had a positive sweat test
(80 mmol/l) and was pancreatic sufficient. This
mutation has previously been described as a
"mild" mutation.24
As reported by Kalin et al,25 the two CF
chromosomes (from unrelated patients) positive
for S1251N also carry the polymorphism
F508C,26 but two other CF chromosomes bearing F508C are negative for S1251N and have
unknown mutations.
The splice mutation 711 + 1G-+T, first described with a high frequency in CF families
living in Quebec,27 was found in three homozygous and two compound heterozygous patients
originating from North Africa. This mutation,
also associated with haplotype A, accounts for
5% of CF chromosomes in this population and
most of the other North African CF chromosomes carry unidentified mutations.
In our study, W1282X has a higher frequency than in the rest of France (CFGAC).
This mutation has been reported with a high
frequency (60% of CF chromosomes) in the
Ashkenazi Jewish population.28 The cause of
this frequency in our sample is unknown as the
origin of these 18 chromosomes is variable
(from the north east to south east of France).

The mutation 3905 insT, described with a
frequency of about 9% in Swiss CF chromosomes29 has been found in our study in a large
gypsy population where it is associated with
AF508.
Discussion
The present study gives a representative view of
the frequency of 105 CF mutations in an important sample of the CF population (600
patients).
From our data, the molecular pathology of
the CFTR gene is exceedingly heterogeneous in
our population: only 86% of the CF alleles
identified with 47 different mutations (out of
105 tested). Most of the unidentified mutations
are probably very rare and almost "private", so
that systematic sequencing of these chromosomes would be necessary, but this procedure
represents an unrewarding amount of work.
Most of the identified CF alleles belong to
haplotype B (96%), while only 62% of groups
A and D and 46% of groups C were identified.
Consequently, for the patients with non-B
chromosomes, polymorphism study (RFLP
and microsatellites) will be necessary to identify
the heterozygotes and allow prenatal diagnosis
for the family. At the end of this study, mutation and haplotype analysis made 98 5% of the
families informative.
Besides informativeness, the identification of
the most frequent mutations in a given population is necessary for genetic counselling for at
risk couples when one of the partners is a
proven heterozygote. For the other partner,
who has an initial risk of being a carrier of 1 in
25, the screening of the seven mutations AF508,
G542X, N1303K, W1282X, 1717-1G-+A,
2184delA+2183A-.G, and R553X allows a
better estimation of this risk; it drops to 1 in 120
if this screening is negative.
Our data also indicate that the goal of population screening for CF mutations (identification
of 90 to 95% of the CF alleles) will be very
difficult in this population of mixed ancestry
because many different mutations will have to
be tested. It seems very unlikely that a frequent
but still unknown mutation will be identified, as
many European CF chromosomes have already
been sequenced.
