Diverse Point Mutations Result in Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD)
Polymorphism in Taiwan
By Tang K. Tang, Ching-Shan Huang, May-Jen Huang, Ka-Bik Tam, Chiao-Hwa Yeh, and Chieh-Ju C. Tang
Glucose-6-PHOSPHATE dehydrogenase (GGPD; EC 1.1.1.49)
deficiency is the most common human enzymopathy, affecting more than 200 million people worldwide. Although
greater than 400 variants have been described based on
clinical and biochemical criteria, little is known about the
molecular basis of these GGPD deficiencies. Recently, the
gene that encodes human G6PD has been cloned and sequenced, which enables us t o examine directly the heterogeneity of G6PD at the DNA level. During the past 10 years, we
examined the G6PD activity in 21,271 newborn Chinese
infants (11,400 males and 9,871 females) and identified 314
(2.8%) males and 246 (2.5%) females having low GGPD
activity. The G6PD gene from 10 randomly selected affected
individuals and their relatives was polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) amplified, subcloned, and sequenced. Our results
indicate that at least four types of mutation are responsible
for the G6PD polymorphism in Taiwan. The first type of
mutation (487 G -+ A) was found in an affected Chinese with
a G t o A change at nucleotide 487, which results in a (163)Gly
t o Ser substitution. The second type of mutation (493 A -+ G)
is a novel mutation that has not been reported in any other

ethnic group and was identified in two affected Chinese. This
mutation causes an A t o G change at nucleotide position 493,
producing an (165)Asn t o Asp substitution. Interestingly, the
487 G + A and 493 A -+ G mutations create Alu Iand Ava II
recognition sites, respectively, which enabled us t o rapidly
detect these two mutations by PCR/restriction enzyme (RE)
digestion method. The third mutation (1376 G 4T) was
found in four affected Chinese. This mutation causes a G to T
change at nucleotide position 1376 that results in an (459)Arg
t o Leu substitution. The 1376 G -+ T mutation seems t o be
the dominant allele that causes G6PD deficiency in Taiwan.
Finally, two affected Chinese were identified as having the
fourth mutation (1388 G -+ A). This mutation causes a G t o A
change at nucleotide 1388 that produces an (463)Arg t o His
substitution. Our studies provide the direct proof of the
genetic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency in the Chinese
populations of Taiwan and the PCRJRE digestion method is
suitable for simultaneous detection of the 487 G -+ A and 493
A --z G mutations.

the identification of four G6PD mutations by direct cloning
and sequencing of the G6PD gene isolated from affected
Chinese with G6PD deficiency in Taiwan. The molecular
defects of these G6PD mutations will be discussed.

LUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE dehydrogenase (G6PD;
E C 1.1.1.49) is an X-linked enzyme. It plays an important role in the generation of NADPH, which is required for reductive biosynthesis and for detoxification of
hydrogen peroxide and other compounds in mature red
blood cells. G6PD deficiency predisposes to a number of
diseases, including drug- or food-induced acute hemolytic
anemia, severe chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia,
and neonatal jaundice. Until now, more than 400 G6PD
variants have been described by extensive biochemical
studies that include measuring the G6PD activity, the
electrophoretic mobility of the enzyme, its pH optimum
curve, the Km values for its substrates, the enzyme thermostability, and the use of substrate
Fortunately, before many G6PD variants had been described, a standardized procedure for biochemical analysis
of G6PD deficiency were established by the World Health
Organization (WHO)? However, even with these standardized methods, it is still difficult to ensure that the G6PD
variants that were considered identical may prove to be
different. For example, the G6PD A- variant, which was
previously regarded as homogeneous mutant, is the result
of at least three different mutations.4.’ Conversely, different
variants such as G6PD Dallas, Birmingham, and Sassari all
turn out to be identical to G6PD
Other similar cases have also been reported.’
Recently, the gene encoding human G6PD was cloned
and the coding sequence derived from cDNA clones has
been determined?” This finding allows the direct examination of mutations that cause the heterogeneity of G6PD
variants. It is clear that, instead of painstaking biochemical
characterization, the determination of the nucleotide sequences of different G6PD variants will be best performed
to determine differences between variants. Indeed, using
this approach, the identification of mutations of the G6PD
gene has been successfully e~tablished.’~~’’

Norwalk, CT). The reactions were performed on a DNA thermal
cycler (Cetus) as follows: denaturation for 35 cycles at 94°C for 1.5
minutes, annealing at 58°C for 1.5 minutes, and elongation at 72°C
for 3 minutes.
Subcloning and DNA sequencing. The PCR-amplified products
were purified on a 1.0% low-meltingagarose gel (Seaplaque; FMC
BioProducts, Rockland, ME). The purified DNA was phosphorylated and blunt end-ligated into a Sma I-digested phosphatasetreated pGEM7Zf( +) vector (Promega-Biotech, Madison, WI).
DNA sequencing of the cDNA clones was performed by the

PCR products were electrophoresed on a 3% agarose gel (NuSieve
3:l; FMC BioProducts) containing ethidium bromide.
RESULTS

G6PD activity assay. The normal mean value of G6PD
activity at 30°C was first established for the Chinese
population in our laboratory. It was 8.10 f 2.04 IU/g
hemoglobin (Hb) for newborn babies, 6.46 2 1.24 IU/g Hb
for children, and 5.24 2 1.01 IU/g Hb for adults. Using an
automated enzyme-linked method (see Materials and Methods), we examined 21,271 (11,400 males and 9,871 females)
Chinese newborn infants. Our results showed that 314
(2.8%) males and 246 (2.5%) females had low G6PD
activity. Among these, 10 randomly selected subjects and
some of their relatives, who were considered to be G6PD
deficient in this screening, were further analyzed at the
DNA level.

Determination of the G6PD mutations. The G6PD gene
consists of 13 exons and 12 introns spanning approximate 20
kb of genomic DNA." The coding region is located in exons
2 to 13. The entire coding regions of G6PD gene from
normal and G6PD-deficient individuals were PCR amplified using eight sets of primers (Table 1). Each amplified
fragment was subcloned and sequenced.
At least four different types of G6PD mutations were
identified in 9 of 10 subjects examined (Fig 1 and Table 2).
The first type of mutation (487 G + A ) was found in a
Taiwanese with a G to A change at nucleotide 487 that
results in a (163)Gly to Ser substitution. The second type of
mutation (493 A -+ G) different from the wild-type sequence G6PD B was originally found in a male Hakkanese.
This novel mutation, which has not been reported in any
other ethnic group, has an A to G change at nucleotide 493,
resulting in the substitution of (165)Asn to Asp (Fig 1 and
Table 2). Interestingly, the 487 G + A and 493 A -+ G
mutations create A h I andAva 11 recognition sites, respectively, which are useful for later distinction between the
normal and mutant alleles (Table 2). The 493 A + G
mutation was also identified in a Taiwanese (Fig 2A, lane 5)
by the PCRIAva I1 method described in the next section.
The third type of mutation (1376 G -+ T) was identified in a
Taiwanese, which showed a G to T change at nucleotide
1376 resulting in an (459)Arg to Leu substitution (Fig 1).
The same mutation was also identified in her affected
daughter and three other unrelated individuals with G6PD
deficiency (Table 2). Finally, the fourth type of mutation
(1388 G + A), found in both a Hakkanese and a Taiwanese
(Table 2), was a G to A change at nucleotide 1388 that
results in an (463)Arg to His substitution (Fig 1). A
summary of G6PD mutations in these affected Chinese of
Taiwan is listed in Table 2.
IdentiJicationof 487 G - + A and 493 A -+ G mutations by
PCRIRE digestion method. Because the mutations occurring at nucleotide positions 487 and 493 create Alu I and
Avu I1 sites, respectively, this finding enable us to directly
examine these two mutations without sequencing the whole
gene, but, instead, by simply cleavaging the PCR products
with appropriate RE. Because these two mutations are only
6 bp apart, a primer set (Pl/P2) was designed to amplify a
130-bp DNA fragment that encompossed both mutations
(see Materials and Methods). Simultaneous examination of
the 487 G + A and 493 A += G mutations can be simply
achieved by digestion of the same PCR product with
appropriate RE.
Figure 2A shows the detection of 493 A + G mutation by
PCR/Ava I1 digestion method. Because an internal Ava I1
site is present in the 130-bp PCR-amplified product, two
fragments (119 and 11bp) were generated in normal allele.
However, in patients with 493 A -+ G mutation, three
fragments (86, 33, and 11 bp) were produced. In Fig 2A
(lane 5), a major (86 bp) and a weak (33 bp) band were
identified in an affected male Taiwanese, which indicated
the presence of 493 A + G mutation. The 11-bp fragment is
too small to be detected in this gel. The same mutation was
also found in an affected female Hakkanese (Fig 2A, lane

6), whose son had previously been identified as having a
point mutation at position 493 (Fig 1). Two major bands
(119 bp and 86 bp) seen on the gel indicated the heterozygous status of this female patient. The PCR-amplified
fragments from two normal (lanes 2 and 3) and one male
patient (lane 4; Taiwanese) did not show the presence of
493 A + G mutation.
Using a similar approach, the affected male Taiwanese
with a previously described 487 G --.,A mutation (Fig 1) was
analyzed by PCRIAlu I digestion. Because two internal Alu
I sites are present in the normal allele, four fragments (17,
20,45, and 48 bp) instead of three (17,45, and 68 bp) were
produced from the mutant allele (487 G --., A). However,
the separation of 45- and 48-bp fragments is indistinguishable, and because of their small size, 17- and 20-bp
fragments were undetectable in the agarose gel. Therefore,
only one major band (45 bp + 48 bp) was actually seen in
the mutant allele (Fig 2B, lanes 3 and 4). However, in a
normal individual, two major fragments (45 bp and 68 bp)

were detected (Fig 2B, lane 2). Our results indicate that the
PCR/RE digestion method is suitable for the detection of
487 G --* A and 493 A --.,G mutations.
DISCUSSION

The prevalence of G6PD deficiency varies greatly throughout the world. In some Asiatic populations, G6PD deficiency is known to exist with a relatively high frequency."' In
Taiwan, the current Chinese population may be divided
into four groups (Taiwanese, Mainland Chinese, Hakkanese, and aborigines) based on their origins and migration times.
Taiwanese is the largest Chinese population, descending
from emigrants who left Mainland China during the 17th to
19th centuries. Most of these emigrants were from Fuchien
province located on the southeast coast of China. The
second largest population in Taiwan is Mainland Chinese,
who had resided originally in many provinces throughout
Mainland China and migrated to Taiwan during the period

between 1948 and 1950. The third population is Hakkanese
(Taiwan-Hakka), originally from Chung Yuan, who emigrated from the Kwangtung and Fuchien provinces on the
southern coast of China, and who came to Taiwan primarily
during the 16th and 17th centuries. The native Taiwan
aborigines are a much smaller group, containing at least
nine distinct tribes whose ancestors are believed to have
arrived in Taiwan from Mainland Asia several thousand
years ago.
Among these four groups, the Hakkanese has been
reported as having the highest prevalence (4.52%) of G6PD
deficiency.m The prevalences for other populations in
Taiwan are 1.57% (Mainland Chinese), 0.33% (Taiwanese), 3.5% (aborigines, Ami tribe), and 0.3% (aborigines,
all other tribe), respectively.".2'
We reported herc a relatively high prevalence (2.6%) of
G6PD deficiency among 21,271 newborn Chinese infants.
Nucleotide sequence analysis of the DNAs isolated from 10
of these patients and their relatives indicates that at least
four types of mutation are responsible for the G6PD
polymorphism in the Chinese of Taiwan (Fig 1 and Table
2)The first type of mutation (487 G + A) was identified in
a Taiwanese. The single base change results in a (163)glycine
to serine substitution. The same mutation was also found in
G6PD Mahidol variant," which has been reported to be one
of the most common deficient variants in South East Asia.
The second type of mutation (493 A + G ) is a novel
mutation that has not been reported in any other ethnic
groups and was identified in a Hakkanese and a Taiwanese.
The 493 A + G mutation results in an (165)Asn to Asp
amino acid substitution in the G6PD protein. The biochemical features of this mutation have not been characterized.
Interestingly, both 487 G + A (163 Gly + Ser) and 493
A + G (165 Am + Asp) mutations are located in exon 6,
which is close to the putative G6P-binding domainZ'.*' and
the single amino acid change that occurred at these two

positions is identical with the G6PD from
rat,%
and human9(Table 3). In addition, both 487 G + A and 493
A + G mutations createAlu I andAvu I1 sites, respectively.
In this report, we designed a specific primer set (Pl/P2)
that may allow to simultaneously detect both mutations in
the same PCR-amplified product by the PCR/RE digestion
method (Fig 2).
The third type of mutation (1376 G + T) was identified
in three Taiwanese and one Hakkanese. This single base
mutation leads to one amino acid change from (459)Arg to
Leu that is conserved in both human' and rata (Table 3).
The same mutation was also found in G6PD Canton
variant2' and three other Chinese G6PD variants (TaiwanHakka, Gifu-like, and Agrigento-like) in Guangdong,
China." Finally, a Taiwanese and a Hakkanese were
identified as having 1388 G + A mutation. This mutation,
causing a single amino acid substitution from (463)Arg to
His, is highly conserved in human," rat,%and Drosophilu"
(Table 3). The same mutation was also identified in five
other Chinese variants from Southern China.?xInterestingly, both mutations (1376 G + T and 1388 G + A) are
located in exon 12, which is close to the putatively NADPbinding domain- in exon 10.

GGPD POLYMORPHISM IN TAIWAN

In this report, 10 unrelated Chinese with low G6PD
activity were examined. At least four types of mutation have
been identified in the Chinese population of Taiwan. The
Taiwanese and Hakkanese who have been screened with
G6PD deficiency contain 493 A -+ G, 1376 G +T, and 1388
G -+ Amutations (Table 2). Interestingly, none of the three
mutations described here are specific for the G6PD deficiency in either Taiwanese or Hakkanese. This could be
partially due to the intermarriage between Taiwanese and
Hakkanese after they moved to Taiwan. In addition, among
10 subjects examined, only one Taiwanese was found to
contain 487 G + A mutation. At the present time, it is
difficult to tell whether this mutation is specific for Taiwanese or not. Further analysis of more patients may answer
this question.
It is interesting to note that the 1376 G -+ T mutation
seems to be the most common allele that causes the G6PD

deficiency in Taiwan, because 4 of 10 subjects examined had
this mutation, whereas the mutations occurring at nucleotide 493, 1376, and 1388, respectively, are three major
alleles that make up 80% (8 of 10) of the disease gene.
These results were further confirmed by our later studies in
which the total sample population was increased to 94
affected Chinese (Chang et al, manuscript in preparation).
In addition, among 10 subjects examined, one individual
did not show any of these four known mutations, which
suggests that some unidentified mutation(s) could lead to
the G6PD deficiency in the Chinese of Taiwan.
