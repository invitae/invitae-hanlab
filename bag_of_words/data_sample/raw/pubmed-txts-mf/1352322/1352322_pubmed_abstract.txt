Two new point mutations have been detected in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene of a patient with a clinical diagnosis of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The patient is a compound heterozygote, in whom the mutant allele inherited from his English father has a single base substitution of A for G in exon 3, changing the codon for residue 80 in the mature protein from glutamic acid to lysine. The mutant allele inherited from his mother, who is of Irish origin, has a single base pair deletion in the codon for residue 743 in exon 15 that causes a frameshift and introduces a new stop codon in the adjacent position. The glu80 to lys mutation results in a transport-defective phenotype and a mature protein that migrates abnormally slowly on nonreduced SDS-PAGE, but normally under reducing conditions; this was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and expression in vitro. The deletion in exon 15 results in a null phenotype in which the putative truncated receptor protein cannot be detected in cultured skin fibroblasts and the amount of mRNA derived from the allele is reduced. The glu80 to lys mutation was found in a further five unrelated individuals in a sample of 200 FH patients from the London area and in 11 from a sample of 77 FH patients from Manchester. Haplotype analysis suggested that all the patients had inherited this allele from a common ancestor. The deletion in exon 15 was not found in the London sample, nor in any unrelated individuals in the Manchester sample.
