Summary
Partial gene deletion is the major cause of mutation leading to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and
Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Partial gene duplication has also been recognized in a few cases. We
have conducted a survey for duplication in 72 unrelated nondeletion patients, analyzed by Southern blot
hybridization with clones representing the entire DMD cDNA. With careful quantitative analysis of hybridization band intensity, 10 cases were found to carry a duplication of part of the gene, a frequency of 14%
for nondeletion cases (10/72), or 6% for all cases (10/181). The extent of these duplications has been
characterized according to the published exon-containing HindIII fragment map, and in six of the 10
duplications a novel restriction fragment that spanned the duplication junction was detected. The resulting
translational reading frame of mRNA has been predicted for nine duplications. A shift of the reading
frame was predicted in four of the six DMD cases and in one of the two intermediate cases, while the
reading frame remained uninterrupted in both BMD cases. RFLP and quantitative Southern blot analyses
revealed a grandpaternal origin of duplication in four families and grandmaternal origin in one family. In
all five families, the duplication was found to originate from a single X chromosome. Unequal sisterchromatid exchange is proposed to be the mechanism for the formation of these duplications.
Introduction

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common and severe neuromuscular disease in man. It occurs with an incidence of about 1/3,300 male births
and has an X-linked recessive mode of inheritance.
Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is a clinically less
severe form of the dystrophy, and it is allelic to DMD
(for review, see Worton and Thompson 1988).
The cloning of the DMD gene and the identification
of its protein have made it possible to characterize mutations of the gene at both the DNA and protein level.
So far, the majority of the detectable mutations at this

locus are of the deletion type, which accounts for about
60% of all mutations (den Dunnen et al. 1987; Forrest
et al. 1987; Koenig et al. 1987; Darras et al. 1988;
Baumbach et al. 1989; Gillard et al. 1989). Deletions
are not uniformly distributed throughout the gene, and
two deletion-rich regions have been identified (Koenig
et al. 1987; Darras et al. 1988; Wapenaar et al. 1988;
Baumbach et al. 1989; Gillard et al. 1989). There is
no apparent correlation between the size of the deletion and the severity of the disease, and sequences
deleted in DMD patients may also be deleted in BMD
patients (Hart et al. 1987; Liechti-Gallati et al. 1987;
Davies et al. 1988). However, deletions identified in most
DMD patients were predicted from sequence analysis
to have shifted the translational reading frame, whereas
deletions identified in most BMD patients have maintained the reading frame (Malhotra et al. 1988; Monaco
et al. 1988; Baumbach et al. 1989; Gillard et al. 1989),

Duplication Mutation at the DMD Locus
thus providing an explanation for the phenotypic differences in most deletion patients.
Duplication of part of the DMD gene has also been
revealed in a few patients. These duplications were
identified by probing the patients' DNA with both
genomic probes (Bertelson et al. 1986; den Dunnen et
al. 1987; Hu et al. 1988) and cDNA probes (Greenberg
et al. 1988; Hu et al. 1988). However, an extensive study
on duplication similar to that carried out with deletion
has not been described. In the present report, we present our findings on the systematic study of gene duplication in 72 unrelated DMD and BMD patients in
whom no deletion of any exon was found. We report
the frequency of duplication, the pattern of its distribution, and the genotype/phenotype comparison (i.e.,
frameshift vs. in-frame duplication, as compared with
severity of the disease). We also report the origin of
duplication in two families, results which, when combined with those for three other families previously
reported by us, suggest a preferential male origin of the

duplication.
Subjects and Methods
Patients
Eleven boys, two of whom were brothers, were found
to have duplications. All have been followed for several
years in the Muscular Dystrophy Clinic of the Hospital
for Sick Children. The diagnosis of DMD or BMD was
based on clinical findings including grossly elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) activity, pseudohypertrophy
of the calf muscles, electromyographic abnormalities
characteristic of myopathy, muscle biopsy findings consistent with muscular dystrophy, the patient's age when
the diagnosis was made, and the progression of muscle
weakness. Patients in this study were classified as DMD
if they became wheelchair-bound before the age of 12
years and as BMD if still ambulant at age 16 years. Patients who became wheelchair-bound at ages of 12-16
years were classified as intermediate phenotype. The
patients were also evaluated for disease severity by using
a numerical scale which divides the disease severity into
five categories: 1 = severe DMD; 2 = milder DMD;
3 = intermediate; 4 = severe BMD; 5 = milder BMD
(Gillard et al. 1989). Four patients under the age of
16 years were also classified for disease phenotype by
comparing the clinical findings with those of members
of each class at a similar age. The phenotypic classification of the 11 patients is shown in table 1.
Nine of the 11 patients are isolated cases with no

683

family history, and the other two (HSC935 and
HSC1511) are affected brothers with no other family
history. CK activity has been measured in mothers of
seven isolated cases. Five mothers (for patients HSC627,
1045, 1337, 1417, and 1575) had an elevated CK level
and thus are presumptive carriers; in two isolated cases
(HSC689 and HSC679) the mother's CK level was normal, but since the sister of HSC689 had an elevated
CK level, the mother is also considered a presumptive
carrier.
Probes
The XJ (DXS206) probes and the cDNA probes
(cdnal and cdna5) that detect the first 20 exons of the
gene were isolated in our laboratory (Ray et al. 1985;
Thompson et al. 1986; Burghes et al. 1987). Additional
cDNA probes (cDNA4-5a, cDNASb-7, cDNA8, and
cDNA9-14) from Dr. L. M. Kunkel's laboratory were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection,
and other genomic probes were gifts from Drs. L. M.
Kunkel (the pERT probes [DXS164], J-Bir[DXS270],
and 99-6 [DXS41]), G. J. B. van Ommen (754 [DXS84]
and P20 [DXS269]), J. L. Mandel (C7 [DXS28]), and
K. E. Davies (OTC). The cloning of these probes has
been described elsewhere (Aldridge et al. 1984; Davies
et al. 1985; Dorkins et al. 1985; Hofker et al. 1985;
Monaco et al. 1985, 1987; Koenig et al. 1987; Wapenaar
et al. 1988).
Southern Blot and Densitometric Scanning Analyses

DNA used in the present study was extracted from
blood leukocytes or from the lymphoblastoid cell lines
of patients, their family members, and normal individuals. DNA concentrations were quantified using a spectrophotometer and also by monitoring the intensity of
ethidium bromide staining on a test gel. DNA close
to equal amounts was used in each lane in order to determine the dosage difference of hybridization band intensity. The DNA was digested to completion with the
appropriate restriction enzyme, separated on 0.6%0.8% agarose gel by electrophoresis, and transferred
to Hybond-N.m membrane (Amersham). The membranes were hybridized with 32P-dCTP random-primed
DNA probes (Feinberg and Vogelstein 1983).
The autoradiographic film was scanned using a transmission densitometer (computing densitometer model
300A; Molecular Dynamics). The area under each peak
(peak value) (see fig. 3) represents the intensity of each
hybridization band. The peak area was divided by the
total peak area of all bands in that sample lane to ob-

tain the relative peak value, i.e., the relative band intensity. Owing to the fact that the bands with double (duplication patient) or triple (duplication carrier) intensity
increase the total peak area and therefore alter the relative peak value, a normalization factor is required. To
obtain the normalization factor for a duplication patient, the bands showing single intensity in a normal
male and similar intensity in the duplication case were
selected; and the ratio of mean peak values of these
bands for the normal male and for the duplication case
provides the appropriate normalization factor. All the
relative peak values from the duplication case were then
multiplied by this factor. To obtain the normalization
factor for a duplication carrier, the bands showing single intensity in a normal male and double intensity in
the duplication carrier were selected. For the normal
male and the duplication carrier the ratio of mean peak
values of these bands (i.e., the normalization factor).
was obtained by dividing the mean peak value of the
normal male with half the mean peak value of the carrier. All the relative peak values from the carrier were
then multiplied by this factor. Because the hybridization band intensity is estimated according to the ratio
of the intensity of each band to that of all bands in

the same sample lane, the results are not affected by
variation of DNA quantities. Multiple exposure of the
autoradiographic film was used to ensure the appropriate linear intensity response of all the hybridization
bands.
Results

Gene Duplication

Ten of the 72 unrelated nondeletion patients were
found to have partial gene duplication. This was shown
by probing the patients' DNA, digested with HindIII
and EcoRI, respectively, with clones representing the
entire DMD cDNA. In each of the 10 cases, one or
more exon-containing fragments corresponding to a set
of contiguous exons hybridized with double intensity,
indicating the duplication of these exons. Patient
HSC935 and his elder brother HSC1511 both were
classified as BMD and were found to carry an identical
duplication of exons 2-7. Two restriction enzymes were
used in the analysis to avoid ambiguous results due either to the small size of some exon-containing fragments or to comigrating fragments and to confirm any
duplication results obtained. DNA from a normal male

Duplication Mutation at the DMD Locus

68S

and a normal female was used as the hybridization intensity standard. All blots were reprobed using a genomic
probe known to reside outside the gene, in order to avoid
miscalculation of the band intensity due to possible variation in loading of DNA. The HindIII fragments that
contain the duplicated exons as well as the cDNA probes
used to detect these duplications are summarized in table 1 and figure 1. Four of the 10 duplications (HSC627,
678, 689, and 1575) had previously been recognized
using genomic probes and were later confirmed with
cDNA probes (Hu et al. 1988, 1989). These four cases
are included in the present report for the purpose of
phenotype/genotype comparison as well as for calculating the duplication frequency. Examples of Southern
blot analysis for the six new duplications are shown
in figure 2. The duplication of specific bands was confirmed by scanning the autoradiographic film by using
a transmission densitometer. The scanning results are
in agreement with the visual observation. An example
of the densitometric analysis for the duplication case
HSC1417 and his family is shown in figure 3 and table 2.
In six of the 10 duplications, an altered-size restriction fragment was detected (figs. 1, 2B, 2C, and 4). We
believe that in each case this fragment contains the duplication junction (Hu et al. 1988), since it was detected
in the presence of all the normal size fragments, was
only detected with a probe close to the junction (i.e.,

near one end of the duplicated region), and could be
detected using more than one restriction enzyme (figs.
2B, 2C; Hu et al. 1988; data not shown). Therefore,
it is unlikely that this novel fragment either represents
a polymorphic allele or results from other types of DNA
rearrangements such as deletion or insertion, since with
a deletion one or more bands would be missing and
with an insertion the presence of two, instead of one,
novel fragments is the most likely outcome (see Discussion for details). The identification of the same novel
fragment in carrier mothers and sisters but not in other
individuals of the family further confirmed that the
altered-size fragment segregates with the duplication,
a result consistent with a duplication junction fragment
(fig. 4; data not shown).
Frameshift and In-Frame Duplications

It is known that some exons of the DMD gene do
not contain an integral number of triplet codons (Koenig et al. 1988; Malhotra et al. 1988; Baumbach et al.
1989; Koenig et al. 1989), and duplication or deletion
of a DNA segment containing such an exon would be
expected to cause a shift of the translational reading
frame of the mRNA. Because the intron/exon boundaries of parts of the DMD gene as well as the nucleotide sequence of the entire DMD cDNA have been determined, the resulting translational reading frame can

quences of duplications on translational reading frame
whether the junction of duplication lies within or outside an exon. In four of the nine duplications (cases
627, 679, 1045, and 1337) in which we have predicted
the reading frame, the junction can be detected with
cDNA probes, and this raised the possibility that the
junction might lie within an exon. However, we were
able to show that in each case the junction does not
lie within an exon, since at least one of three restriction
enzymes (HindIII, EcoRI, and BglII) gave a normal
restriction-fragment pattern (Koenig et al. 1987; Hu
et al. 1988; Darras and Francke 1988; authors' unpublished data) with no junction fragment (figs. 2A and
2F; data not shown). In addition, we confirmed the extent of the duplication in the two cases: in case 627
by showing with an exon 20-specific subclone that the
junction fragment contains exon 20 and in case 679
by probing patient DNA with two probes -J-Bir and
a subfragment of cDNA 5b-7 -flanking the duplicated
region (Gilgenkrantz et al. 1989; authors' unpublished
data); both probes detect single intensity bands on
HindIl-digested DNA with no junction fragment.
Recently, muscle specimens from two ofthe duplication patients (HSC627 and HSC1337) have been analyzed with western blotting technique using antibodies
directed against the DMD protein, dystrophin. On the
basis of DNA analysis, both of these duplications had
been predicted to have a shift of the reading frame and
were therefore predicted to produce a prematurely truncated protein. Western blot analysis showed that a
smaller protein with the predicted molecular weight
could be detected in both cases (D. E. Bulman, E. G.
Murphy, E. E. Zubrzycka-Gaarn, R. G. Worton, and

689

Duplication Mutation at the DMD Locus
P. N. Ray, personal communication). Because of the
difficulty in obtaining muscle samples, we have not been
able to apply western blot analysis to other duplications.
Origin of Duplication
We have previously traced the origin of duplication
to the maternal grandfather in three of the families of
the patients summarized here (patients HSC627, 689,
and 1575). We have now determined the origin in two
of the three additional 3-generation families (probands
HSC679, 1337, and 1417). In the three families, the
mother and the proband were found to carry the same
duplication, as shown by the triple (mother) and double (patient) intensity of the same exon-containing fragments detected in their DNA (figs. 3 and 5; data not
shown) and also, in two cases (HSC679 and 1337), by
the detection of an identical duplication junction fragment in the patient and his mother (fig. 4B; data not
shown). This indicates that in each case the mother is
a carrier of the duplication and that she has transmitted the chromosome carrying the duplication to her son
and, in one case (HSC1417), to her daughter as well.
The maternal grandparents of two patients (HSC1337
and 1417) were shown not to carry the duplication in
their somatic cell (leukocytes) (figs. 4B and 5), and therefore in these two families the duplication most likely
arose in the germ line of one of the maternal grandparents. In the family of HSC679, the maternal grandmother was found to carry the duplication in her somatic cells (data not shown). Therefore, it is not possible
to trace the origin of the duplication in this family.
In order to determine in which grandparent the duplication arose, RFLP analysis was carried out using probes
within and flanking the DMD gene. As can be seen
in figure 6, several intragenic as well as flanking markers were informative in both families, indicating a >99%
probability that the maternal grandfather's X chromosome was inherited by the proband HSC1337 and that
one of the maternal grandmother's X chromosomes was
inherited by the proband HSC1417.
Discussion

Partial gene duplication has recently been recognized
as one type of molecular defect leading to a genetic
disease. To our knowledge, this has only been demonstrated in two individuals with a genetic disease other
than DMD or BMD. In one case (Lehrman et al. 1987),
a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia was found
to be a compound heterozygote with two different mutant alleles of the LDL (low-density lipoprotein) recep-

Figure 5 A, Southern blot analysis of the case HSC1417 family. DNA was digested with HindIII and hybridized with a cDNA
probe cdna la (Burghes et al. 1987). Two bands (8.2 kb and 4.1 kb)
(indicated by asterisks) in the patient show an intensity similar to
that of the same bands in the normal female (46,XX), while the rest
of his bands show an intensity equal to that of the same bands in
the normal male (46,XY). This indicates the duplication of these
two bands in this patient. These two bands in the mother and sister
of the patient show an intensity approximately triple the single intensity of the same bands in the normal male or 1.5 times the intensity of the double intensity bands in the normal female, while other
bands in these females show the normal double intensity. This confirms
that the mother and sister of the patient are carriers of the duplication. Their carrier status was first suggested by elevated CK level.
The duplication (patient) and triplication (mother and sister) of the
8.2-kb band can best be appreciated by a change of the ratio of intensity in this band and the 7.8-kb band. This ratio is approximately
1:2 in the normal individuals but has been changed to 1.1 in the
patient and in his mother and sister. The triplication of these bands
has been confirmed by densitometric analysis. All bands in the maternal
grandparents show an intensity similar to that in normal individuals,
indicating that they do not carry such a duplication in the somatic
cells. B, Southern blot analysis of the case HSC1337 family. DNA
was digested with HindIII and hybridized with the cDNA probe
cDNA8 (Koenig et al. 1987). Three bands (7.0 kb, 3.7 kb, and 3.1
kb) (as indicated by asterisks) in the patient show an intensity similar
to that of the same bands in the normal female (46,XX), while the
rest of his bands show an intensity equal to that of the same bands
in the normal male (46,XY), indicating duplication of these bands
in this patient. These bands in the mother of the patient show an
intensity approximately triple the single intensity of the same bands
in the normal male or 1.5 times the intensity of the double intensity
of these bands in the normal female. This confirmed the carrier status of this mother, which had been suggested earlier by elevated CK
level. The detection of an identical junction fragment in the patient
and his mother further confirmed her carrier status (fig. 2B). Both
the maternal grandparents have normal intensity bands, and no junction fragment is detected in them, indicating that they do not carry
the duplication in their somatic cells. A control band (C) of 5.3 kb
is shown at the bottom of both autoradiographs and is detected by
the flanking probe 99-6 (Aldridge et al. 1984).

Duplication Mutation at the DMD Locus
tor gene, one of which had a duplication of seven exons.
This duplication mutant allele produced an elongated
LDL receptor with severely reduced binding capacity
for LDL. The other case was a patient with LeschNyhan syndrome, an X-linked recessive disease, in
whom it was shown that two of the nine exons of the
HPRT (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase) gene are duplicated (Yang et al. 1984). The duplication mutant gene produced an mRNA with increased
size consistent with the size predicted on the basis of
DNA analysis, and the resulting enzyme (HPRT) had
no measurable activity (Wilson et al. 1986).
Evidence of gene duplication in the DMD locus was
first provided by Bertelson et al. (1986), who reported
a DMD patient with a double intensity hybridization
band detected with the intragenic genomic probe,
pERT87-15. Subsequently, den Dunnen et al. (1987)
detected a double intensity band with an intragenic
genomic probe, J-Bir, and with the field-inversion gel
electrophoresis technique. We had conducted a survey
for duplication in 120 unrelated DMD and BMD patients (Hu et al. 1988). Using a limited number of
genomic probes and a cDNA probe that detects the first
16 exons of the gene, we detected three duplications
plus nine deletions in these patients. Because the probes
used in that survey covered only about one quarter of
the gene, the frequency of duplication (as well as deletion) was known to be underestimated. As well, it was
recognized that the relative frequency of duplication
versus deletion might not be accurate. The use of cDNA
probes of the entire DMD gene was necessary in order
to obtain accurate estimates of the frequency of duplication and deletion as well as the ratio of the two.
Recently, Gillard et al. (1989) in our laboratory have
completed a study of deletion in 181 unrelated DMD
and BMD patients including the 120 cases mentioned
above. Southern blot analysis was carried out by using
probes representing the entire DMD cDNA, and 109
deletions were found. With the same approach, we have
searched for duplications in the remaining 72 nondeletion patients, and 10 duplications were identified.
The estimated frequency of deletion (60%) is about
10 times higher than that of duplication (6%). It is apparent that this is mainly due to the existence of the
deletion-rich region defined by (a) the last four exoncontaining HindIII fragments (ECHFs) detected by
cDNA probe Sb-7 and (b) all the ECHFs detected by
cDNA probe 8 (Baumbach et al. 1989; Gillard et al.
1989). More than two-thirds of our deletions (80/109)
(Gillard et al. 1989) but less than one-third of our duplications (3/10) were found in this region (table 1 and

691

fig. 1), i.e., with at least one endpoint contained within
this region. When deletions and duplications found in
this region are excluded, the remaining deletions (29)
are still four times more frequent than duplications (7).
There are at least two possibilities that may contribute
to the much higher frequency of deletion. First, even
though unequal chromatid exchange would be expected
to generate deletion as well as duplication with equal
frequency (Weatherall and Clegg 1979; Vogel and Motulsky 1986), other mechanisms may also exist that can
only produce deletion. In fact, many deletions found
in other genetic diseases appear not to result from unequal chromatid exchange but rather to be generated
from a single chromatid (Vanin et al. 1983; Lehrman
et al. 1985; Nicholls et al. 1987). This type of intrachromatid deletion would not be expected to be a
mechanism for generating duplication. It may be reasonable to assume that most deletions in the deletionrich region described above resulted not from unequal
chromatid exchange but by a mechanism producing only
deletion, since far more deletions than duplications were
found in this region (over 25 times more). Second, duplications may not always be stably inherited, in that the
duplicated region may undergo spontaneous deletion.
There are two recent reports supporting this hypothesis. In one case (Yang et al. 1988), the Epstein-Barr
virus-transformed lymphoblasts from a Lesch-Nyhan
patient with a partial duplication of the HPRT gene
were found to have undergone spontaneous deletion
of the duplicated region. In the second case (Gitschier
1988), a female was found to carry three different X
chromosomes in her germ-line cells: a deletion of part
of the factor VIII gene, a duplication of part of the factor VIII gene, and a normal copy of the gene. Because
both the deletion and duplication mutations had arisen
on the same X chromosome and because cloning and
restriction-mapping results were not consistent with a
reciprocal event for the generation of the deletion and
duplication, it was suggested that the duplication might
be a precursor to the deletion. It also remains a possibility that some duplications and deletions in the DMD
gene may not cause disease phenotype. If so, the true
ratio of deletion versus duplication could be different
from that observed in the patients.
Tandem duplication of a DNA sequence creates a
duplication junction flanked by two segments of DNA
which are normally separated in the genome. Therefore, the detection of a single duplication junction fragment can be taken as strong but not unequivocal evidence that the duplication is of tandem organization.
The cloning of the duplication junction and the map-

692

ping of both ends of the duplicated region in two of
our duplications (HSC627 and 689) have confirmed
the tandem organization of these duplications (authors'
unpublished data). We know from the literature that
tandem duplication of DNA sequences can be generated by two mechanisms, namely, unequal chromatid
exchange and DNA slippage. The latter has been found
to be involved in short DNA motifs (probably less than
10 bp) (Dover 1989). In our cases the duplicated region
is large (100 kb or larger), and therefore the DNA slippage mechanism is unlikely the one. The insertion of
DNA, which would create two junctions at the site of
insertion (Gitschier 1988; Kazazian et al. 1988), can
also generate a duplicate copy on a chromatid, but the
chance for the duplicated copy to be arranged in tandem with the original copy would be expected to be
very low and therefore is less likely the mechanism here.
Deletions appear to occur with approximately equal
frequency in DMD and BMD (Forrest et al. 1987; Hart
et al. 1987). Sequences deleted in DMD patients may
also be deleted in BMD patients, and the size of deletion does not appear to correlate with the severity of
the disease. It has been proposed (Monaco et al. 1988)
that DMD may result largely from frameshift deletions
while BMD usually results from deletions that maintain the translational reading frame. The same hypothesis has also been proposed for duplication (Hu et al.
1988). Studies carried out with deletions showed that,
though exceptions exist, the reading-frame hypothesis
holds true for most deletions (Malhotra et al. 1988;
Monaco et al. 1988; Baumbach et al. 1989; Gillard et
al. 1989; Koenig et al. 1989). In the present study,
frameshift duplication accounts for four of the six DMD
cases and for one intermediate case while in-frame duplication accounts for two BMD cases in addition to one
intermediate and two DMD cases (table 1), suggesting
that this hypothesis in general also holds true for duplications.
An exception to the reading-frame hypothesis is the
in-frame duplication of exons 3 and 4 that results in
two cases with severe phenotypes (one DMD and one
intermediate). This is especially noteworthy since in two
cases a larger in-frame duplication of exons 2-7, which
spans the smaller duplication of exons 3 and 4, gave
rise to the milder BMD (table 1 and fig. 1). At this point
we do not have an explanation for this unusual finding,
but we suspect that this might be due to structural differences of the resulting proteins. It has been reported that
dystrophin and alpha-actinin share their greatest similarity over a putative actin-binding N-terminal region that
corresponds to about amino acids 14-240 of dystro-

Hu et al.

phin, and this domain covers exons 2-8 (Hammonds
1987; Koenig et al. 1988). Therefore, the duplication
of exons 2-7 results in the duplication of almost the
entire putative actin-binding domain. As a result, the
structure and function of this domain might be partially preserved. The duplication of exons 3 and 4, on
the other hand, results in the duplication of only part
of this domain, and this may lead to a severe disruption
of the structure - and therefore of the function - of this
domain. However, since the function of dystrophin has
not been definitively determined, the above explanation remains only a speculation.
The duplication of specific exons provided a marker
to study the origin of the mutation. In conjunction with
RFLP haplotype analysis, the chromosome that carries
the duplication can be assigned specifically to the family member in whom the duplication originated. Such
analyses were carried out in the present study with two
families in which the affected boy and his mother both
carried a duplication while the grandparents did not.
In one family (HSC1337) it was found that the maternal grandfather's X chromosome was transmitted to
the proband (fig. 6A). Since the grandfather neither carries the duplication in his somatic cells (leukocytes) nor
shows any sign of this disease, the duplication most
likely arose in his germ line. In family two (HSC1417),
it was one of the maternal grandmother's X chromosomes that was transmitted to the proband (fig. 6B).
Since the grandmother does not carry the duplication
in her somatic cells (leukocytes), the duplication most
likely arose in her germ line. It is possible, however,
that in one or both of these grandparents the duplication arose in an embryonic cell prior to segregation of
the germ line. In such a case the resulting mosaicism
might be detectable in some non-germ-line tissues, but
only the leukocytes were investigated in the present
study. There is also the possibility that one or both of
these duplications arose in a postzygotic somatic division in the mother of the proband. If this happened,
it must have been at a very early embryonic stage, since
the duplications are clearly present in both mothers'
somatic cells as well as in their germ cells. Also, the
unequal crossover event would have had to occur between the sister chromatids of the mother's duplicationbearing X chromosome, since crossing-over between
nonsister chromatids of the mother's two X chromosomes would have resulted in the exchange of the flanking RFLPs of the duplication-bearing X chromosome
received by her son and her daughter. No such switch
of the flanking RFLPs was found.
The demonstration of a male origin of duplication

Duplication Mutation at the DMD Locus
in the DMD locus would indicate the involvement of
an intrachromosomal event such as unequal sisterchromatid exchange. In addition to the case described
in the present study (HSC1337), we have elsewhere
reported three other DMD duplications with a male
origin (Hu et al. 1989) (table 1), suggesting that duplications may arise more frequently by an intrachromosomal mechanism than by an interchromosomal mechanism such as unequal crossing-over in meiosis. It is
interesting that the only duplication (HSC1417) that
we found to display a female origin also indicates an
unequal sister-chromatid exchange event. If this duplication had resulted from nonsister chromatid exchange,
the polymorphic alleles flanking the duplicated region
would have been recombined. However, no recombination of flanking RFLPs was found.
We were able to study the DNA from mothers of seven
isolated duplication cases (five DMD [HSC679, 689,
1337, 1417, and 1575] and two intermediate [HSC627
and 1045]), and all seven were found to carry the duplication. In addition, five of the seven mothers had
elevated CK levels, and this further confirmed their carrier status. This indicates that none of these seven duplications originated as new mutations in the mother.
Roses (1988) has recently reported a study of 15 DMD
families in which a deletion has been identified. Fourteen of the 15 mothers were found to carry the deletion. Even though the number of cases is too small for
statistical analysis, these findings on duplication and
deletion are unexpected in view of the theoretical expectation that one-third of DMD patients are new mutants, an expectation which is supported by the majority
of population studies (Bobrow et al. 198 8). Further analysis of the population aspects of DMD, combined with
molecular analysis, may clarify such apparent discrepancies.
One possibility that could lead to fewer new mutants
than predicted by Haldane's (1935) rule is a higher rate
of mutation in sperm than in ova. Our finding that four
duplications originated in a male (the maternal grandfather) and that only one originated in a female (the
maternal grandmother) would be in agreement with this
view. It is known that in human germ-cell development,
all oocytes can be formed by as few as 23 cell divisions
occurring before birth, while several hundred cell divisions are needed for the formation of sperm (Vogel and
Rathenberg 1975). If there is no selection and the chance
for a chromatid exchange event per cell division is equal
in male and female, it would be expected that mutant
sperm would accumulate during spermatogenesis, i.e.,
the frequency of a sperm carrying a mutant gene would

693

be higher than the frequency of an ovum carrying a
mutant gene. Since unequal sister-chromatid exchange
would be expected to be associated with DNA replication, it is therefore likely that duplications do occur
more often in male than in female. However, the above
explanation assumes that most (if not all) of the duplications are generated in mitosis. Because all five duplications traced to a grandparent were transmitted to only
a single offspring, there is no evidence of germ-line
mosacism, and a meiotic exchange event cannot be ruled
out. Wagstaffet al. (1985) have reported a very interesting finding which might lead to an explanation for a
preferential male origin of duplication at the DMD locus. Using haploid yeast strains as experimental material, they observed that meiotic intrachromosomal exchange events occurred at least 10 times more frequently
in the absence of a homologous chromosome than its
presence. They further suggested that, in the absence
of a homologous chromosome, synaptonemal complexes, which are normally required for homologous
chromosome pairing, would mediate sister-chromatid
pairing, thus resulting in the very high intrachromosomal recombination frequencies seen during haploid
meiosis. Since the DMD locus does not have a homologous counterpart on the Y chromosome, a much higher
frequency of meiotic intrachromosomal recombination
might be expected at this locus. This explanation does
not seem to hold for deletion, however, since a recent
study (Darras et al. 1988) of 13 deletion families has
revealed male origin of the mutation in five families and
female origin in eight, a result not suggesting a higher
mutation rate in male.
In conclusion, the present study suggests the following: (1) Partial gene duplication accounts for the mutation in about 6% of patients with DMD and BMD.
Duplications were found to occur at a much lower rate
than did deletions, and this may imply that mechanisms
other than unequal chromatid exchange play an important role in the generation of deletions at this locus.
(2) Duplications that are expected to shift the translational reading frame tend to lead a more severe clinical
phenotype than do duplications that maintained the
reading frame. (3) Duplications appear to originate more
often in male than in female. This might be due either
to the differences in the germ-cell development in male
and in female or to the lack of homologous pairing
of the DMD region in meiosis. (4) The finding that in
all five cases ascertained the duplication originated from
a single X chromosome would suggest that unequal
sister-chromatid exchange is the most common mechanism for the generation of duplication in DMD and

694

BMD. Whether this type of chromosomal exchange also
takes place in other parts of the human genome remains
to be seen.
