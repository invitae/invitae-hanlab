Two novel missense mutations in the cystathionine -synthase gene
in homocystinuric patients

Received: 12 December 1994 / Revised: 2 February 1995

Abstract Direct sequencing of the coding region of the
cystathionine [3-synthase (CBS) gene in two h o m o c y s t i n uric patients revealed the presence of two novel missense
mutations. The first mutation, a 1111G ~ A transition, resuited in the substitution of the evolutionary conserved
valine-371 by a m e t h i o n i n e residue (V371M) and created
a new NlalII restriction site. The second mutation, a G---~A
transition at base-pair 494, resulted in an a m i n o acid
change from cysteine to tyrosine (C165Y) and abolished a
BsoFI restriction site. Both mutations were found in a
c o m p o u n d heterozygous state with the previously described 833T ~ C transition.

Introduction
Homocystinuria caused by cystathionine ~-synthase (CBS)
deficiency is an i n b o r n error of m e t h i o n i n e m e t a b o l i s m
and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The pred o m i n a n t clinical manifestations of the h o m o z y g o u s state
are arteriosclerosis, thromboembolic complications, skeletal abnormalities, ectopia lentis and mental retardation
(Boers 1986; M u d d et al. 1989). The large range in the
severity of the clinical features and in the biochemical response to therapy suggests genetic heterogeneity of the
CBS gene. CBS, a pyridoxal-phosphate-requiring enzyme,
catalyzes the synthesis of cystathionine from homocysteine and serine (Finkelstein and Martin 1984). To date,

14 mutations have been reported in the coding region of
the CBS gene (Kraus 1994), which has been m a p p e d to
21q22.3 (Mtincke et al. 1988). In this report, we describe
the identification of two new missense mutations in this
coding region.

Materials and methods
Patient 1 was a 33-year-old man who suffered from ectopia lentis,
osteoporosis, scoliosis and mental retardation. He also showed typically marfanoid features, such as arachnodactyly and dolichostenomelia. Therapy consisted of the daily administration of 750 mg
pyridoxine, which reduced his total homocysteine levels to 35
gmol/1 (control levels 8-18 ~tmol/1). Patient 2 was a 44-year-old
male patient with many of the clinical features of homocystinuria:
ectopia lentis, thrombosis, seizures, arachnodactyly and scoliosis.
Family examination showed that a sister and a brother were also
affected. All were pyridoxine-responsive.
For mutation detection, RNA was extracted from cultured fibroblasts (Chomczynski and Sacchi 1987) and first-strand cDNA
was synthesized by standard methods. The cDNA product was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using three sets of
oligonucleotides (Table 1). The generated PCR fragments covered
the entire coding region and were subsequently subjected to direct
sequencing according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Applied Biosystems, Forster City, CA, USA).

Results and discussion
Direct sequence analysis of the entire coding region of the
CBS gene in patient 1 showed a novel 1111G --~ A transition and the previously described 833T --+ C (I278T; Hu
et al. 1993) missense mutation (data not shown). The observed G-to-A transition resulted in an amino acid exchange from valine to methionine at codon 371 of the mature protein (V371 M) and introduced a new NlaI[I restriction site. Both transitions were confirmed at the genomic
DNA level by NlaIII and BsrI restriction analysis, respectively. The substituted valine-371 residue appears to be
highly conserved in homologous proteins in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic species (Fig. 1). Evolutionary conservation may indicate the functional relevance of an amino
acid in the structure and function of the mature protein.
Thus, this mutation is thought to interfere with the normal
functioning of the CBS protein.
Patient 2 was found to be a compound heterozygote for
the 833T --~ C missense mutation and a novel 494G ~ A
transition. This latter transition resulted in a substitution
of cysteine-165 by tyrosine (C165Y) in the CBS protein
and abolished a BsoFI restriction site. The putative amine
acid is located in the catalytic domain of the protein (J. P.
Kraus, personal communications). This G-to-A transition
may disrupt a disulphide bond in this catalytic domain.
The disruption of a disulphide bond could interfere with
intermolecular interactions and consequently with the catalytic activity of the protein. However, the present data
provide no indications whether these two new missence
mutations are compatible with pyridoxine responsiveness

NKNI

in vivo, because the other mutation (833T --~ C) is associated with responsiveness both in the homozygous and in
the compound heterozygous states (Hu et al. 1993).
