Abstract
A specific type of gene mutation affecting the LDL receptor
has been found in many Finnish patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The mutant allele is characterized by a
9.5-kb deletion extending from intron 15 to exon 18. Molecular
cloning and sequencing of a cDNA segment corresponding to
the deleted allele indicated that the mutant receptor differs
radically from the normal one because of loss of the domains
encoded by exons 16, 17, and 18. The carboxy-terminal portion
of the normal receptor, comprising the amino acids 750-839,
has been replaced by an unrelated stretch of 55 amino acids.
The mutant allele was found to occur in 23 (50%) of 46 unrelated FH patients with an established functional defect in the
LDL receptor. In cultured fibroblasts from the FH patients
with the 9.5-kb deletion, both receptor-mediated binding and
internalization of 'l25-LDL were lower than normal, the
former, on average, by 25%, and the latter, on average, by 50%.
This combined functional defect probably results from both
impaired attachment and impaired internalization of the mutated receptor. It remains to be investigated whether this Finnish type of LDL receptor gene mutation, here designated
FH-Helsinki, occurs in other ethnic groups.

Introduction
The pathogenesis of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)' was
shown by Brown and Goldstein (1) to be the genetically determined lack of functional LDL receptors. As the function of
LDL receptors is to carry plasma LDL particles to their intracellular sites of catabolism, any mutation resulting in defective
function of LDL receptors must impair clearance of plasma
LDL. Such receptor-mediated impairment results in accumulation of LDL in the circulation and produces the clinical
picture of FH. This leads to the clinical sequelae of FH, such as
premature coronary heart disease (2).

Studies on functional defects in LDL receptors have defined four different pathogenic entities leading to defective
clearance of plasma LDL: (a) defective synthesis ofthe mRNA
for the receptor, (b) defective transport of the receptor precursors from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex, (c)
defective binding of LDL to the receptor, and (d) failure ofthe
cells to internalize the receptor-bound LDL (1). At the level of
DNA structure, the cause of the disease has been found to be
more heterogeneous than would be expected from the functional classification alone (1, 3-16). The numerous mutations
at the DNA level provide a spectrum of tools for learning more
about the normal functioning of the receptor, but such diversity hampers attempts to develop diagnostic aids based on recombinant DNA techniques. This applies especially to genetically heterogeneous populations, which are likely to contain
many different mutations of the LDL receptor gene. In genetically homogeneous populations, in contrast, the LDL receptor
gene is likely to be affected by fewer mutations; hence, there is
a higher probability that among the FH patients in such populations one specific type of LDL receptor mutation will be
especially frequent (9, 12, 17).
In genetic terms, the Finnish population forms a relative
isolate and has its own panel of inherited diseases ( 18). In this
population a specific type of LDL receptor mutation has been
found to occur in at least one-third of unrelated patients heterozygous for FH (19). Restriction enzyme mapping of the
mutant allele (19) and sequencing of a genomic DNA fragment containing the mutation point (15) suggest that this Finnish type of mutation is due to a deletion of - 9 kb extending
from intron 15 to exon 18. However, these studies did not
permit an analysis of the exact structure of the carboxy-terminal portion of the mutated receptor protein, since it was not
possible to determine whether intron 15 and part of exon 18
are cleaved off from the mature mRNA or preserved.
In this paper we report the detailed structure of the Finnish
type of mutated LDL receptor. The functional characteristics
of the altered receptor were also investigated. The mutation
was found to alter the carboxy-terminal end of the receptor
and to produce a phenotype in which internalization of LDL is
defective.
Methods
Patients. In our search for heterozygotes for FH, we initially identified
a total of 600 patients from the records of the Lipid Outpatient Clinic
of the University Hospital of Helsinki, all having fasting serum total
cholesterol levels 2 9.5 mmol/liter (2 370 mg/dl). For the study, we
selected 46 patients using the following additional criteria: presence of
primary hyperlipidemia; presence of tendon xanthomas; a hypercholesterolemic first-degree family member; and a positive history of premature coronary heart disease in the family. The study group consisted
of 21 males and 25 females aged 46±12 yr (range 28-80 yr), and having

relative body weights of 1 16±17% (according to the Metropolitan Life
Insurance Tables). 12 patients had a history of myocardial infarction
and 27 had overt signs ofcoronary heart disease. Four normolipidemic
patients undergoing minor surgery for nonmalignant diseases served as
controls. All patients and controls were of Finnish origin and unrelated.
Southern blot analysis ofDNA. DNA was prepared from leukocytes
obtained from 20 ml of venous blood (20). DNA (5-10 pg) was digested with Bam HI and Pvu II under the conditions recommended by
the manufacturer, fractionated by gel electrophoresis on 0.6% agarose,
and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were hybridized in a
medium containing 6X standard saline citrate (SSC) ( I X SSC denotes
0.15 M NaCl and 0.0 15 M trisodium citrate), 5X Denhardt's solution,
50% deionized formamide, 0.25% SDS, 100 Mg/ml salmon sperm
DNA, and a 1-2 X 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled 0.95-kb LDL receptor
cDNA probe covering exons 1 1-17 (19). The probe was labeled by a
random oligonucleotide priming technique, using a commercial kit
(Amersham International, Amersham, UK) (21). After hybridization
for 16-20 h at 42°C, the filters were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at
room temperature and in 0.2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42°C. Autoradiography of the dried filters was conducted by exposing them to Kodak
XAR films (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) for 2-3 d at -70°C.
cDNA cloning. To clone a cDNA molecule corresponding to the
mutant LDL receptor commonly occurring in Finland, fibroblasts
were first cultured (for details, see below) from a patient (FH 10)
known to carry the deleted gene. Total RNA from 1-2 X 108 cells
was isolated using the LiCl-urea method (22) and enriched for
poly(A)-containing RNA by oligo(dT)-cellulose affinity chromatography (23). For the synthesis of cDNA, 2Mg of the mRNA was used (24).
The cDNAs were methylated and ligated to Eco RI linkers. After
cleavage with Eco RI, the linker-containing cDNAs were ligated to Eco
RI-cleaved, alkaline phosphatase-treated Xgtl I arms (Amersham International). The DNA was packaged in vitro and amplified in Escherichia coli Y1090 cells. About 1 X I05 phage plaques were plated out,
transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled
LDL receptor probe extending from exon 11 to exon 17 (19). One
positive clone with an insert 2.4 kb in size was selected; this hybridized
with an exon 15-specific oligonucleotide probe, but not with an exon
16-specific probe (15). The insert was cleaved by Eco RI digestion and
subcloned into the pGEM-4 vector for sequencing.
Polymerase chain reaction. For unequivocal determination of the
cDNA sequence around the putative deletion point (15), another strategy was used involving the DNA amplification technique with the aid
of the thermoresistant polymerase enzyme (New England Biolabs,
Beverly, MA). First, 2 MAg of poly(A)-containing RNA from patient FH
10 was used for synthesizing the first cDNA strand directed by an exon
18-specific primer (complementary to nucleotides from 3,604 to
3,621, 5'GGAAGCACTAGGTGGGCG3'; see references 25 and 26).
Second, the amplification reaction for these RNA-DNA hybrids was
carried out using methods described by Saiki et al. (27). One of the
nucleotide primers (5CAGCTCCACAGCCGTAAGG3') extended
from nucleotide 2,193 to nucleotide 2,211 of exon 15 (25, 26) and the
other was the exon 18-specific primer used for the synthesis of the first
cDNA strand (see above). 25 amplifying cycles were performed. Onethird of the amplified material was fractionated by electrophoresis on
1.2% agarose, and the amplified cDNA fragment (- 600 bp in size)
was eluted from the gel with a commercial kit (Geneclean, Bio 101
Inc., La Jolla, CA) and sequenced directly without further subcloning.
Sequencing. Sequencing of double-stranded DNA was performed
by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method (28), using the
enzyme Sequenase (United States Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH).
The first sequencing primer was selected from exon 15 (5'CAGCTCCACAGCCGTAAGG3'; see above) and the second primer according
to a stretch at the 3' end of the sequence that had been determined with
the first primer (5ACCTTCTCTCACTTGGG3'). A hydropathicity
plot of the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA was constructed with the algorithm described by Kyte and Doolittle (29), using
a window of nine amino acids.

Isolation ofplasma lipoproteins and lipid assays. Any lipid-lowering drugs were withdrawn at least 4 wk before the blood samples were
taken, and the patients were advised to continue their cholesterol-lowering diet. After an overnight fast, blood samples were collected in
0.1% EDTA, and plasma, the LDL fraction (d = 1.006-1.063 g/ml),
and the HDL fraction (d = 1.063-1.215 g/ml) were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation at 4°C (30). Plasma total cholesterol, total
triglycerides, and the cholesterol contents of isolated lipoprotein fractions were measured by colorimetric enzymatic methods (Boehringer
Mannheim Biochemicals, Mannheim, FRG).
Preparative isolation and radioactive labeling ofLDL. Blood from
healthy normolipidemic donors was collected in 0.1% EDTA, and the
LDL fraction (d = 1.020-1.050 g/ml) and lipoprotein-deficient serum
(LPDS; d > 1.21 g/ml) were prepared by sequential ultracentrifugation
at 4°C (30). LDL was radiolabeled with 1251I using the iodine monochloride method as modified for lipoproteins (31). The specific activities
of different preparations ranged from 32 to 168 cpm/ng protein.

Fibroblast cultures. Skin biopsies were taken from controls from
the inguinal region, and from patients from the antecubital region.
Fibroblasts were grown in monolayer and maintained in a humidified
atmosphere (5% C02) at 37°C in 75-cm2 stock flasks containing 10 ml
of standard growth medium. This medium consisted of Eagle's MEM
supplemented with penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 ,g/ml), 2
mM glutamine, and 10% (vol/vol) FCS (Gibco, Paisley, Scotland). The
studies were undertaken between the 5th and 16th passages of the
cultures.
Binding, internalization, and degradation of labeled LDL. All experiments were performed according to a standard format. Confluent
monolayers of fibroblasts from stock flasks were dissociated with a
solution containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA, and seeded at a
concentration of 1 X I05 cells/dish into 60 X 15-mm dishes containing
2 ml of standard growth medium (day 0). On day 3, when the cells were
in early logarithmic growth, they were washed with Dulbecco's PBS,
after which 2 ml of fresh medium containing 10% (vol/vol) human
LPDS was added (final protein concentration, 5 mg/ml). The experiments were performed on day 5 when the cells had been incubated
with LPDS for 48 h and were still preconfluent and actively dividing, as
documented with [3H]thymidine. At this stage of cell growth no correlation was found between the number of cells per dish and the activity
of the LDL receptors. The experiments were started by replacing the
medium with fresh medium containing LPDS and '25I-labeled LDL
(16 Mg protein/ml) in the absence or presence of a 20-fold excess of
unlabeled LDL. The monolayers were incubated for 5 h at 37°C, after
which the medium was removed and precipitated with TCA. The
acid-soluble fraction was treated with hydrogen peroxide, extracted
with chloroform to remove free iodine, and counted to determine the
amount of '251-labeled acid-soluble material formed by the cells and
released into the medium (degraded '251-LDL) (32). The monolayers
were then treated with heparin and the amount of '25I-labeled LDL
released by the heparin was counted to determine how much had been
bound to the LDL receptors present on the cell surface (bound 1251I
LDL) (33). After heparin treatment, the monolayers were dissolved in
0.2 N NaOH and an aliquot was counted to determine the amount of
'251-LDL present inside the cells at a steady state (internalized 12511
LDL). The quantities of LDL receptor-mediated binding, internalization, and degradation of '251I-LDL were calculated by subtracting the
values for binding, internalization, and degradation in the presence of
excess unlabeled LDL from the corresponding values obtained in the
absence of excess LDL. The results were correlated with the total
protein content of the cells, as measured by the method of Lowry et al.
(34), using BSA as standard. As an index of the rate of internalization
relative to receptor binding, the amount of '251-LDL present within the
cells at 5 h and the amount of '251-LDL degraded by the cells during the
5-h incubation period were added together and divided by the amount
of receptor binding at S h (internalization index) (35). In each assay,
two of the four control cell lines were analyzed in parallel with three to
seven FH cell lines. All determinations were done in duplicate; the
results of each pair did not differ by more than 3%.

Results
Molecular characterization of the mutant mRNA and the corresponding receptor protein. Hybridization of DNA samples of
FH patients with the LDL receptor 3' probe revealed that 23 of
the 46 FH patients (50%) displayed only the normal 17.5-kb
fragment when Bam HI was used for digestion and the normally occurring polymorphism (14- and/or 16-kb fragments)
when DNA was cleaved with Pvu II (Fig. 1). The remaining 23
patients (50%) showed an additional hybridizable fragment

with both enzymes (an 8-kb fragment with Bam HI and an
11-kb fragment with Pvu II), indicating that they carried the
LDL receptor gene deletion which is prevalent in Finland (Fig.
1; see references 15 and 19).
To ascertain the structure of the mutated protein corresponding to the deleted gene, a fibroblast cDNA library of a
heterozygous FH patient (FH 10) was first constructed. Genomic cloning and partial sequencing of this mutant allele had
earlier demonstrated that a DNA segment extending from intron 15 to exon 18 in the 3' region of the LDL receptor gene is
deleted. In light of this information it was reasoned that the
normal and mutant alleles could be separately identified from
the cDNA library: cDNA clones containing the normal allele
would hybridize with both exon 15- and exon 16-specific
probes, while cDNA clones containing the mutant allele would
only hybridize with an exon 15-specific probe. With this strategy, one positive clone containing a 2.4-kb cDNA insert corresponding to the mutant allele was identified.
DNA sequencing over the mutation site and the areas
flanking this, whether performed with the cDNA clone (see
above) or the amplified cDNA sequence (see Methods) as
template, gave identical information (Fig. 2). From its 5' end
on, the nucleotide sequence of the mutant allele is identical
with that of the normal one up to the last nucleotide of exon
15. After a stretch of 245 nucleotides, the sequence of the
mutant cDNA returns to the normal receptor cDNA sequence
from nucleotide 3,391 of exon 18 onwards. The bridging
stretch of 245 nucleotides between the exon sequences mentioned above is identical to that obtained by sequencing the
corresponding DNA area of a genomic clone from the same

patient (15, and unpublished data), showing that this 5' portion
of intron 15 is present in the mature mRNA. The translational
reading frame of exon 15 continues along this DNA stretch for
164 bp before a stop codon is reached. This sequence is expected to encode the carboxy-terminal end of the mutant protein (Fig. 2). The resulting mutated protein is deduced to be
identical with the normal protein in amino acids 1-749 and
totally different beyond that (Fig. 2). The mutated LDL receptor protein contains 804 amino acids as compared with the
839 normally found in the LDL receptor (25).
The 3' ends of the mutant LDL receptor gene and its normal counterpart, as well as the postulated splicing mechanisms
of the mutant mRNA, are illustrated schematically in Fig. 3.
According to the present and published data (25, 26), the size
of the deletion is 9,500 bp. The mutant allele should direct
the synthesis of a 4.5-kb mRNA species, i.e., one of a length
not significantly different from that (4.2 kb) previously estimated on RNA hybridization blots (15).
The hydropathicity profiles of the carboxy-terminal ends
of the normal (amino acid sequence data from reference 25)
and the mutant LDL receptor are illustrated in Fig. 4. This
part of the normal receptor is characterized by a strongly hydrophobic region of 22 amino acids that traverses the membrane and so anchors the receptor to the cell (25). In the mutated receptor, in contrast, this part is replaced by a weakly
hydrophobic region comprising two short stretches of 7 and 16
amino acids with mean hydropathicity indexes of 0.8 and 0.9,
respectively (Figs. 2 and 4).

Functional properties of the mutated receptor. To investigate the functional properties of the mutated LDL receptors,
fibroblasts from skin biopsies were cultured and their abilities
to bind, internalize, and degrade '25I-LDL were then investigated. In four control cell lines the mean amount of receptor
binding after standard incubation for 5 h at 37°C was 178±52
ng (mean±SD) 251I-LDL/mg cellular protein. At this time the
cells contained 1,064±229 ng '25l-LDL/mg cellular protein,
and a total of 3,155±1,044 ng of the labeled apoprotein had
been degraded by the fibroblasts. Relative values for binding,
internalization, and degradation were estimated by setting the
average of the respective values for control cell lines in each
assay at 100% and calculating the percentage values for the FH
heterozygote cell lines.
The fibroblasts from the 23 heterozygous patients with FH
who had the 9.5-kb deletion (Figs. 5 and 6, open circles), as
compared with normal subjects, bound slightly smaller
amounts of 'l25-LDL (mean, 75% of normal), but both internalization and degradation of the labeled LDL were more
markedly impaired. The respective mean values for internalization and degradation were only 49 and 48% of normal (Fig.
5). The values of the relative internalization index (normal
value = 2; 100% [internalization] + 100% [degradation]/100%
[binding]; see Methods) were calculated for each individual
cell line. Those with the Finnish type of LDL receptor gene
deletion showed poorer ability to internalize LDL in relation
to binding of LDL (mean 1.28; range, 0.76-1.88) (Fig. 6).
In the fibroblasts from the 23 patients with the heterozygous form of FH without the 9.5-kb deletion (Figs. 5 and 6,
closed circles), the binding of I251-LDL was, on average, only
about half of normal (Fig. 5). Internalization (mean value,
48%) and degradation (mean value, 49%) of '25I-LDL were
impaired approximately in proportion to the defect in binding.
However, in terms of internalization efficiency, these FH heterozygotes were heterogeneous. Thus, some of the patients had
a near-normal internalization index and could be categorized
as "binding defective" (33), and some had a clearly low internalization index, and so could be designated as "internalization defective" (35).

hyperlipidemia was due to accumulation of extra cholesterol
in the lipoprotein fraction of density 1.006-1.063 g/ml, i.e.,
the LDL fraction.
Discussion
We found previously that about one-third of patients with FF1
in Finland have a common LDL receptor gene mutation due
to a large deletion at the 3' coding region of the gene (19). The
present investigation precisely defines the structural and functional characteristics of the receptor protein encoded by the
mutant allele. The mutation is here designated as FH-Helsinki, according to the residence of the first proband identified.
The work of Brown, Goldstein, and co-workers has demonstrated that exon 16 and the 5' part of exon 17 of the LDL
receptor gene encode the membrane-spanning region of the
receptor, while the 3' part of exon 17 and a small portion of
exon 18 encode its cytoplasmic domain (26). Both these domains are essential for the proper functioning of the receptor.
The present study shows that the FH-Helsinki allele lacks
exons 16 and 17, and about one-third of exon 18. The splicing
acceptor site in exon 18 has also been deleted, and in accordance with this a copy of a portion of intron 15 is included in

the mature LDL receptor mRNA. The receptor protein encoded by the mutant allele is deduced to be 35 amino acids
shorter than its normal counterpart, with a carboxy-terminal
part beyond residue 749 bearing no resemblance to that of the
latter (Fig. 2).
Many of the large rearrangements within the LDL receptor
gene so far described involve Alu sequences at either one or
both ends of the deletion (3, 6-8, 10, 1 1). Two patients with
FH had a large deletion in the 3' coding region of the LDL
receptor gene, ranging from 5 (FH 274; see reference 3) to 7.8
kb (FH 781; see reference 10) in size. Both deletions extend
from an Alu sequence in intron 15 to an Alu sequence in exon
18, but the Alu sequences involved are different (Fig. 7). The
mature mRNAs corresponding to these two alleles differ in
length (10). The location of these deletions is similar, but not
identical, to that present in the FH-Helsinki allele. The FHHelsinki allele does not involve Alu sequences at either end of
the deletion and it encodes a mRNA molecule that is shorter
than those corresponding to the mutant genes in patients FH
274 and FH 781 (Fig. 7). But although the three mutations
differ at the DNA and RNA levels, the corresponding proteins
are likely to be identical. In each case the splicing acceptor site
in exon 18 has been deleted. Accordingly, the mature mRNA
always includes a copy of the 5' part of intron 15, which in all
three cases contains an identical stretch of 164 nucleotides
continuing the reading frame of exon 15 before a termination
codon (UAA) is reached (Fig. 7).
In both of the patients studied by the Dallas group, fibroblast culture assay revealed defective internalization of LDL
particles (3, 10). We found that in the fibroblasts from patients
with one FH-Helsinki allele internalization of '251I-LDL was
likewise impaired, giving rise to an internalization-defective
phenotype. This was as expected, since an intact cytoplasmic
domain is known to be essential for internalization of LDL
particles (5, 36). Furthermore, fibroblasts of some of the pa1112

781, and FH-Helsinki: structural comparison of the 3' ends of the
normal and mutant alleles and their corresponding mRNAs. Exons,
introns, and Alu sequences are indicated by closed bars, solid lines
and striped bars, respectively. Exon numbers are indicated above the
normal gene. Note that the mutations in FH 274 and FH 781 involve Alu-Alu recombinations, whereas no Alu sequences are involved at either end of the deletion in FH-Helsinki. The corresponding regions of the mature mRNAs are depicted below each gene with
solid segments joined by dashed lines. All three mutant mRNAs are
expected to encode an identical receptor protein. The mutations FH
274 and FH 781 are described in references 3 and 10.

tients with the FH-Helsinki allele also showed defective binding of '25l-LDL. This suggests that the deletion has not only
brought about loss of structures essential for clustering of receptors into coated pits and their subsequent internalization,
but has also caused impairment of the attachment of the receptor to the cell membrane (Fig. 8). Indeed, the carboxy-terminal domain of the mutant receptor has a relatively low hydropathicity index value, averaging < 1 (Fig. 4), which does
not fulfill the requirements for a membrane-spanning region
(29). It remains to be investigated whether the mutant receptors encoded by the FH-Helsinki allele are secreted into the
culture medium and, if so, whether secretion of the mutant
receptors takes place in vivo.
The present study adds a third example to the category of
LDL receptor gene mutations that are prevalent in a particular
population and have been characterized in detail at the DNA
level. In the majority of French Canadians with FH, the disease is due to a large deletion eliminating the promotor region
and the first exon ofthe LDL receptor gene (12). The Lebanese
mutation created a premature termination codon at amino
acid 660, which results in the synthesis of a truncated receptor
protein (9). In all three cases the enrichment of a specific mutant allele can easily be explained as a "founder gene" effect.
The same explanation may apply to the high prevalence of a
specific LDL receptor gene mutation in South Africa, as
judged by haplotype analysis with restriction enzymes (17); the
exact molecular defect in this allele has not yet been reported,
however. In Lebanon and South Africa the prevalence of FH is
considered to be exceptionally high, with an estimated frequency of 1 in 100 (2, 9). Whether the prevalence of FH in
Finland is also exceptionally high remains to be determined.
The possible occurrence of the FH-Helsinki allele in other
populations likewise remains to be studied.

Figure 8. Schematic picture of the
normal LDL receptor and its mutated FH-Helsinki counterpart. The
carboxy-terminal end of the mutated receptor is truncated and
differs from the normal one. Hydropathicity index values and LDL
binding data suggest that the attachment of the mutant receptor to the
cell membrane is unstable, resulting
in partially defective binding and
markedly impaired internalization
of LDL particles.
