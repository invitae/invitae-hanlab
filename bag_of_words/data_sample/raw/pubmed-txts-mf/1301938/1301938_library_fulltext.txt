Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting from mutation of the
HEXA gene encoding the a-subunit of the lysosomal enzyme, p-N-acetylhexosaminidaseA (Hex A).
first detected by Akli et al. (GeWe have discovered that a Tay-Sachs mutation, IVS-9+ 1 -A,
nomics 11:124-134, 1991), is a common disease allele in non-Jewish Caucasians (10/58 alleles
examined). A PCR-based diagnostic test, which detects an NlaIII site generated by the mutation,
revealed a frequency among enzyme-defined carriers of 9/64 (14%). Most of those carrying the allele
trace their origins to the United Kingdom, Ireland, or Western Europe. It was not identified among 12
Black American TSD alleles or in any of 18 Ashkenazi Jewish, enzyme-defined carriers who did not
carry any of the mutations common to this population. No normally spliced RNA was detected in PCR
products generated from reverse transcription of R N A carrying the IVS-9 mutation. Instead, the low
levels of mRNA from this allele were comprised of aberrant species resulting from the use of either of
two cryptic donor sites, one truncating exon 9 and the other within IVS-9, spliced to exon 10.
Numerous additional splice products were detected, most involving skipping of one or more surrounding exons. Together with a recently identified allele responsible for Hex A pseudodeficiency (TriggsRaine et al. Am J Hum Genet, 1992), these two alleles accounted for almost 50% (29164) of TSD or
carrier alleles ascertained by enzyme screening tests in non-Jewish Caucasians.

INTRODUCTION
Tay-Sachs disease (TSD, G,,
gangliosidosis
type I) is a recessively inherited lysosomal storage
disorder resulting from a defect of the a-subunit of
p-hexosaminidase A (Hex A; subunit structure,
aUp; reviewed in Neufeld, 1989; Sandhoff et
al., 1989; Gravel et al., 1991). Mutations of the
HEXA gene, encoding the a-subunit, have been
shown to be responsible for Tay-Sachs disease and
its variants. Many of these have been investigated
in populations with an elevated incidence of the
disease, including Ashkenazi Jews ( Triggs-Raine
et al., 1990; Paw et al., 1990; Grebner and Tomczak, 1991; Landels et al., 1991), French Canadians (Andermann et al., 1977; Myerowitz and

Hogikyan, 1988; Hechtman et al., 1992; Fernandes et al. , 1992), and Moroccan Jews (Vecht et
al., 1983; Navon and Proia, 1991; Drucker et al.,
1992).
In the general population, a much larger collection of mutations is being enumerated, although
these are generally being identified in single or
small numbers of cases (Akli et al., 1991; Mules et
al., 1992; Triggs-Raine et al., 1991). Recently, we
screened for mutations in six non-Jewish TSD pa-

tients by heteroduplex and single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis after PCRdependent amplification of individual exons and
splice junctions (Triggs-Raine et al., 1991). We
analyzed 12 mutant alleles but 4 of them, one in
each of 4 patients, remained unidentified.
We now report that the unidentified allele in all
4 patients is a base substitution at the IVS-9 donor
splice junction, earlier described in a French patient by Akli et al. (1991), and show that the
mutation can be detected by a modified SSCP procedure. We also established a diagnostic test for
the mutation and determined that it accounts for a
high proportion of mutant alleles in non-Jewish
Caucasians. PCR studies on reverse transcripts
(RTIPCR) were used to show that no normal
mRNA was synthesized from this allele.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DNA Sources and Isolation

DNA from cultured fibroblasts from two patients and one fetus diagnosed with infantile TaySachs disease (HSC lines 904, 1943, and 3026)
and one patient with the juvenile variant (HSC
cell line 1721) originated from the Hospital for
Sick Children in Toronto. These samples were included in a previous study in which one Tay-Sachs
disease allele from each cell line was identified
(Triggs-Raine et al., 1991).
DNA obtained from leukocyte pellets or sonicates from patients, obligate carriers, and enzymedefined carriers of Tay-Sachs disease were from the
Boston, California, Toronto, and Baltimore TaySachs disease prevention programs. Some of these
samples have been used in previous studies (TriggsRaine et al., 1990, 1992; Mules et al., 1992). DNA
was isolated from fibroblasts or leukocytes as described (Hoar e t al., 1984).
DNA Amplification
Amplification of DNA sequences containing individual HEXA exons was done as described
(Triggs-Raine et al., 1991). Direct sequencing of
PCR products was performed by the method of
Winship (1989). In some cases, oligonucleotide
primers internal to the PCR products were used as
sequencing primers.

SSCP Analysis
SSCP analysis (Orita et al., 1989) was performed using a 32P-labeled PCR products as described (Triggs-Raine et al., 1991), except that
alternative gel buffer systems were 1 x TBE/IO%
glycerol, 0.5 x TBE/S% glycerol, or 1 x TBE/no

glycerol. Gels were run at 12 mA overnight (1620 hr), 7.5 mA overnight, or at 40 W for 2.5 hr,
respectively.
Screening for the

+ 1 IVS-9G+A

Mutation

The G+A mutation at the + 1 position of IVS9 generated an NlaIII restriction site which is absent in normal DNA. The mutation was detected
by PCR amplification of the surrounding sequences
in genomic DNA, followed by digestion of a 10-20
~1 aliquot with Nla 111 and electrophoresis in 8%
polyacrylamide or 3% agarose. AnNlaIII site was
introduced into the 5' (sense) primer as a control
for complete digestion (see Fig. 2 for primer sequences).
RNA Studies

RNA isolation was by the method of Chirgwin
et al., (1979). RT/PCR conditions were as described (Triggs-Raines et al., 1992). RTIPCR
products were gel-purified in 5% polyacrylamide
and subcloned into dephosphorylated, blunt-end
digests of pBS+ vector using standard methods
(Sambrook et al., 1989). Double-stranded plasmid
sequencing was done using the reagents and protocol supplied in the Sequenase kit (United States
Biochemical Corp. )
RESULTS

PCR products generated from all 14 exons were
sequenced directly for three of the four cell lines
(904, 3026, and 1721). In addition to the mutations previously identified ( ATG477-478in 904;
IVS-2
1 G + C in 3026; G1496A in 1721), we
detected the simultaneous presence of G and A at
the + 1 position of IVS-9 (Fig. 1). These results
indicated that the second mutant allele in these

found among 18 Ashkenazi Jewish, enzymedefined carriers from the Toronto Tay-Sachs
Screening Program who did not carry any of the
mutations common to this population (TriggsRaine et al., 1990). Of the 19 individuals with this
allele, 14 traced their ancestry to Ireland, the
United Kingdom, or Central or Western Europe;
one was Mexican; four carriers are of unknown
background.
Since this mutation was previously undetected
by SSCP analysis, we investigated modifications of
the SSCP procedure which would permit its identification. We found that by decreasing the glycerol concentration of the gel matrix or, more strikingly, by reducing it to zero, a significant band
shift became readily apparent in DNA samples
containing the mutation (Fig. 3B,C).
Analysis of mRNA

We examined the impact of the IVS-9 + 1
mutation on splicing of the a-subunit
mRNA to determine the amount and nature of the
species formed. These studies were done on cell
line 904 which contained the ATG47,-478deletion in exon 5 as the second allele. Two mRNA
species were possible, one containing the ATG
deletion and the other with the normal sequence
at that site. They could be distinguished after RT/
PCR amplification by the loss of a DdeI site due to
the deletion mutation (Triggs-Raine et al., 1991).
This procedure showed a large excess of mRNA
containing the ATG mutation (data not shown).
In order to investigate the mRNA species derived from the IVS-9 mutation, we used an RT/
PCR specific for this allele (Fig. 4A). T h e RT/
PCR, spanning exon 4/5 to exon 11, produced a
reduced amount of amplification product when
mRNA from HSC 904 was used compared to control mRNA, despite using a 32 cycle PCR (Fig. 4B,
lane 1 vs 2). We examined the RT/PCR product to
determine whether there was any normally spliced
sequence at the exon 9/10 junction. This was done
by digesting the product with AlwNI, which would
cleave only the cDNA synthesized from normally
spliced RNA, since the restriction site overlapped
the junction. The RT/PCR product from normal
DNA was successfully cut by AlwNI (Fig. 4B, lane
4)while DNA from 904 was not cut at all (lane 3).
Thus, no normal splicing was observed as a result
of the IVS-9 mutation.
When the allele-specific amplification was expanded to include exon 12, we began to see numerous splice products and evident heteroduplexes
trailing the main bands (Fig. 5A). These were gel-

patients was a G-A substitution at the
1 position of the donor splice site of IVS-9.
We established a PCR-based diagnostic test for
the mutation in genomic DNA in which the normal and mutant alleles could be distinguished by
an NlaIII site generated by the mutation. Digestion
of the 167 bp PCR product with NlaIII was expected to give fragments of 149 and 18 bp for normal DNA versus 82, 67, and 18 bp for mutant
DNA (Fig. 2A). Digests of amplified DNA from
all four patient cell lines indicated the presence of
the mutation in coupling with a normal allele in
each case (Fig. 2B).
We used the NlaIII diagnostic test to screen for
the mutation among several groups of DNA samples. The results indicate that the mutation is relatively common among TSD alleles outside the
Jewish community, present in 10/58 affected individuals and obligate carriers and 9/64 enzyme-defined carriers in our sample (Table 1). However,
the mutation was not detected among 12 unrelated
Black American TSD alleles, 8 of which have been
identified (Mules et al., 1992). Further, it was not

gel (Fig. 5b). All lacked the AlwNI site (data not

9/10 splice junction. Two types of splicing abnormalities were detected. First, either of two alternative cryptic donors were used in place of the
normal exon 9 donor site (Fig. 6), one within exon
9 40 nucleotides upstream of the splice junction (at
9i in the figure, which is nucleotide 1034 of the
complete HEX4 cDNA) and the other in intron 9
17 nucleotides downstream of the normal donor
site (at 90 in the figure). Although our reaction
conditions were not quantitative, it is clear that
the major products were of the 9i-10 or 90-10 form
(Fig. 5A, band 1).
The other type of abnormality observed was
exon skipping. Clones were detected which lacked
exon 8; lacked 11; lacked 10 and 11; or lacked 9,
10, and 11 (variously represented in bands 2-5,

MUTATION COMMON IN NON-JEWISH TSD

erogeneity among non-Jewish TSD alleles, it is
now apparent that two mutant alleles account for
almost half of enzyme-defined, non-Jewish carriers
(9 20164, Table 1). Several other mutations were
seen more than once in our pool of 122 disease
(TSD or variants) or carrier alleles from unrelated,
non-Jewish Caucasians (Table 1). They include
the 4 bp insertion in exon 11 ( TATC,,,,, Myerowitz and Costigan, 1988) and the Gly-269-Ser
substitution in exon 7 (G805A, Navon and Proia,
1989; Paw et al., 1989), which have usually been
associated with Ashkenazi Jewish TSD or adult
variant, respectively, and the exon 8 deletion of
Phe-304 or -305 (ATTCPI0or 9 1 3 ) , first seen in
Moroccan Jews (Navon and Proia, 1991) and now
proving to be more widely distributed (Akli et al.,
1991; Mules et al., 1992).
Consistent with the infantile clinical phenotype
associated with the IVS-9 mutation, no normal
splicing was detected at the exon 9/10 junction in
reverse transcripts from a patient cell culture carrying the allele. Instead, we found that two cryptic
splice sites near the inactivated normal junction,
one inside exon 9 and one just inside intron 9,
coupled with the use of the acceptor site at exon
10, accounted for the majority of the low levels of
mRNA detected from this allele. Both sequences
are compatible with the consensus sequence for
donor splice junctions, AGJgt(a/g)agt(where ‘‘I”
denotes splice), and contain the obligatory gt (underlined) that defines the position of the splice site
(Senapathy et al., 1990). Other splice products
included a variety of exon skips, involving one or
more surrounding exons, including exon 9, although it is not clear if all these abnormal products
are associated with the splice mutation.
The IVS-9 donor splice junction is unusual in
that it contains a C residue in the minus 1 position
(Fig. 6); only 5% of 3724 donor splice sites in a
recent GenBank survey contained a C at this site
(Senapathy et al., 1990). The normal IVS-9 donor
splice sequence thus contains a CpG. Such dinucleotides are prone to mutation because the C residue of the CpG is frequently methylated and
methylcytosine is readily converted, via deamination, to thymidine (Coulondre et al., 1978). Occurrence of such an event at the antisense CpG at
this junction would result in a G+A substitution
at the 1 position. CpG dinucleotides account for
over a third of human polymorphisms and deleterious mutations (Barker et al., 1984; Cooper and
Youssoufian, 1988; Koeberl et al., 1989) and may
explain the repeated occurrence of the same mutations in diverse populations (Mitsuo et al.,

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have identified a G+A substitution at the
1 position of IVS-9 in cell lines
from three non-Jewish, Caucasian patients with
infantile or variant TSD. We took advantage of a
mutation-generated NlaIII restriction site to devise
a PCR-based diagnostic test and found the mutation in 4 more affected individuals (including the
fourth cell line previously analyzed by Triggs-Raine
et al., 1991), 3 independently ascertained obligate
heterozygotes, and 9 enzyme-defined carriers, all of
whom were non-Jewish (enzyme-defined carrier
frequency 9/64=14%, Table 1). It was not seen
among Black American disease alleles or Ashkenazi Jewish carriers tested.
Triggs-Raine et al. (1992) have determined that
another allele, C739T, responsible for Hex A
pseudodeficiency, accounted for 32% of nonJewish TSD carriers ascertained by enzyme screening. Thus, despite early evidence of extreme het-

1990). This may be the case for some TSD mutations (Paw et al., 1991).
The IVS-9
1 G-+A mutation was found in
individuals of Irish, United Kingdom, European,
and Mexican background, as well as in the French
patient cited earlier. In concurrent studies, it has
been shown to be the predominant disease allele in
the Pennsylvania Dutch (Mules e t al., 1992) and
was detected in a Louisiana Cajun individual (McDowel1 et al., 1992). Whether this is a very old
mutation that has become widely distributed or
one that has been introduced repeatedly will require haplotype studies of the HEX4 gene to resolve.
During the preparation of this manuscript, it
came to our attention that Landels et al. (1992)
have identified the same IVS-9 1 G-+A mutation in TSD carriers and patients from the British
Isles. They suggested that the mutation may have
been of Celtic origin as it was found twice as often
in individuals of Irish, Scottish or Welsh descent
compared to those of English origin.
