Abstract
We studied metabolic, polypeptide and genetic variation in
eight glutaric acidemia type II (GA II) patients with electron
transfer flavoprotein (ETF) deficiency. As measured by 3Hfatty acid oxidations in fibroblasts, #-oxidation pathway flux
correlated well with clinical phenotypes. In six patients with
severe neonatal onset GA II, oxidation of 19,10(n)-3H1palmitate ranged from 2% to 22% of control and of [9,10(n)3H] myristate, from 2% to 26% of control. Of two patients with
late onset GA II, one had intermediate residual activities with
these substrates and the other normal activities. Radiolabeling
and immunoprecipitation studies revealed that three of the six
neonatal onset GA II patients had greatly diminished or absent
a- and fi-ETF subunits, consistent with a failure to assemble a
stable heterodimer. Another neonatal onset patient showed
normal synthesis of ,-ETF but decreased synthesis of a-ETF.
Two neonatal onset and two late onset GA II patients showed
normal synthesis of both subunits. Analysis of the pre-a-ETF
coding sequence revealed seven different mutations in the six
patients with neonatal onset GA II. The most common mutation was a methionine for threonine substitution at codon 266
found in four unrelated patients, while all the other mutations
were seen in single patients. No mutations were detected in the
two patients with late onset GA II. (J. Clin. Invest. 1992.

transfer of electrons between several mitochondrial matrix dehydrogenases and the main electron transport chain ( 1). Both
deficiencies are inherited as autosomal recessive traits (2). ETF
is a heterodimer consisting of an a and a p subunit (a-ETF and
,B-ETF), both nuclear coded and synthesized in the cytosol.
a-ETF, but not f3-ETF, is synthesized as a precursor (pre- aETF) larger than the mature form (3). The pre-a-ETF cDNA
coding region comprises 999 base pairs encoding 333 amino
acids, with molecular masses of precursor and mature a-ETF
estimated to be 35 and 32 kD, respectively (4). Although clinical and enzymatic heterogeneity has been well documented in
ETF-deficient GA II patients (2, 5), the molecular basis of this
defect is less well understood, with only one patient reported as
having a glycine to valine substitution at codon 157
(Vall57Gly) in the sequence of pre-a-ETF (6).
In this study, we have examined the biochemical and polypeptide phenotypes and the molecular defects in eight ETF-deficient GA II patients. We measured the oxidation of[9, 10(n)3H]palmitate and -myristate to quantitate ,B-oxidation flux in
GA II cells. We investigated the biosynthesis of both ETF subunits in fibroblasts from these eight patients by radiolabeling
and immunoprecipitation with anti-ETF antiserum. Furthermore, we have studied pre-a-ETF cDNA using GC-clamped
denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE; 7-9), singlestranded conformation polymorphisms (SSCP), direct DNA
sequencing, and restriction endonuclease analyses to characterize the molecular defects in these patients.
Methods

Introduction
Glutaric acidemia type II (GA II)' is an inborn error of fatty
acid and amino acid metabolism characterized by hypoketotic
hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and a characteristic organic
aciduria. The disease is due to a defect in either electron
transfer flavoprotein (ETF) or ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF-QO), two mitochondrial enzymes required for the

Fibroblast and cell culture. Fibroblasts were grown in Eagle's minimal
essential medium with Earle's balanced salts, L-glutamine, and nonessential amino acids (JRH Bioscience, Lenexa, KS) containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and antibiotics
(penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamycin, Sigma Chemical Co., St.
Louis, MO). Control cultures were established from the foreskins of
three healthy male infants and from skin biopsies of seven females and
three males in whom the diagnosis of GA II was ruled out on the basis
of clinical and biochemical analyses and tritiated palmitate assay results. The ETF-deficient GA II patients 1430 (10), 1728 (11), 1803,
1863, 1903, 1916, and 1966 (2) have been described previously. Patient 1430 was identified by Indo et al. (6) as patient YH 1313 and by
Loehr et al. (2) as patient 1902. Patient 9001 developed hypoglycemia,
hyperammonemia, and metabolic acidosis soon after birth. The diagnosis of GA II was made after identification of characteristic plasma
acylcarnitine and urine organic acid profiles (personal communication, Dr. G. J. Mick, University of Rochester).
Materials. Chemicals purchased were of the highest grade available. Tran35S-label (1,000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) was purchased from
ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA). Fixed protein A-positive Staphylococcus aureus cells and deoxynucleotide triphosphates were purchased
from Boehringer-Mannheim Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Entensify was from DuPont-New England Nuclear (Wilmington, DE). Antisera against pig ETF were raised in New Zealand white rabbits as de-

Dr. F. Frerman, University of Colorado, Denver, CO, and Dr. C.
Thorpe, University of Delaware, Newark, DE. Taq DNA polymerase
and PCR buffer were from Perkin Elmer Cetus (Norwalk, CT). The
oligonucleotide primers were synthesized on a model 391 DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). [9,10(n)-3H]myristic and -palmitic acids and deoxyadenosine 5'-a-[35S] thiotriphosphate, triethylammonium salt (1,000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml)
were purchased from Amersham Corp. (Arlington Heights, IL). Random hexamer was from Pharmacia, Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). Mo-MLV
reverse transcriptase was from Bethesda Research Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). RNAsin was from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI).
Fok I and Nla IV were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).
Tritiated palmitate and myristate oxidations. Oxidation of
[9,10(n)-3H]palmitate (20 MM) and -myristate (80 MM) to 3H20 in
fibroblast monolayers was quantitated as described earlier (5, 13).
Immunoprecipitation ofradiolabeledETFsubunits. Immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-ETF antiserum was carried out according to
Ikeda et al. (14), except that the cells were incubated with labeling
medium for 12 h instead of 1 h and that two of the four S. aureus pellet
washes with NaCI, Tris, Triton, deoxycholate, and SDS, and the two
H20 washes were omitted. The immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10% gels as described by Laemmli (15). The
gels were treated for fluorography with Entensify and exposed onto
X-OMAT AR film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) at -80°C.
RNA preparation. RNA was extracted from cultured fibroblasts
according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (15), with the
omission of the reprecipitation step and the addition of a second wash
with 75% ethanol. The final RNA pellet was resuspended in diethyl
pyrocarbonate-treated water and kept at -80°C until used.
cDNA synthesis. Approximately 1 Mg of total RNA was mixed in a
20-Ml reaction volume containing 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.3,5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 2.5 4M
random hexamer, 20 U of RNAsin and 50 U of Mo-MLV reverse
transcriptase. The reverse transcription reaction was performed using a
DNA thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer Cetus) as follows: 10 min at 23°C,
45 min at 37°C, 5 min at 99°C, and 5 min at 5°C.

DNA amplification. The entire coding region ofthe gene was ampli-

fied in five overlapping segments. The primer sequences were designed
from the published sequence of pre- a-ETFcDNA (4). For each pair of
primers, a 39-bp GC-rich sequence was added at the 5' end of one of the
primers to allow optimum analysis by DGGE (9). To the 20-M' reverse

transcriptase reaction mixture were added 80 Ml of a solution containing 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.25 mM MgCl2,0.5MM of
each appropriate primer and 2 U of Taq DNA polymerase. The samples were overlaid with 70 Ml of mineral oil. The amplification reaction
was performed for 35 cycles in a thermal cycler using the following
cycle conditions: 30-s denaturation at 94°C, 30-s annealing at 55°C,
and 1-min extension at 72°C. The final extension was for 5 min. A
10-Ml aliquot of the amplification product was electrophoresed on a
1.5% agarose gel to confirm successful amplification.
DGGE. The optimum gradient condition and length of electrophoresis were determined for each amplified DNA segment by performing
perpendicular DGGE and running travel schedule gels as described
elsewhere (17). 17 Ml of amplification product was mixed with 5 Ml of
loading buffer (30% glycerol, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mM EDTA
and 0.1% orange G), and loaded on a 7% (14% for segment 1) polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1, acrylamide:N,N'-methylene bisacrylamide)
containing the appropriate linear gradient of DNA denaturant (Table
I). Electrophoresis was carried out at 60°C at 150-V constant voltage
for the appropriate length of time (Table I), as described. Gels were
stained with ethidium bromide.
Purification of PCR products for DNA sequencing. 200 Ml of the
amplification product was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel. The
DNA fragment was recovered by cutting the desired band from the
agarose gel, freezing at -20°C overnight, and centrifugation in a Costar
spin-XO.22 Mm cellulose acetate filter unit. The eluate was mixed with 1
Ml of glycogen (20 mg/ml), 0.2 vol of SM ammonium acetate, and 2.5
vol of isopropanol and left 30 min on ice. The precipitated DNA was
pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with 70% ethanol, dried, and
resuspended in 30 Ml of water. In order to sequence independently two
different alleles from a single individual, some samples were electrophoresed on a denaturing gradient gel containing a narrow denaturant
range (10%) centered on the empirical melting point ofthe DNA fragments. The segments of the gel containing the DNA fragment corresponding to each allele were excised, soaked in water for 15 min, and
incubated overnight with 2 vol of 0.5 M ammonium acetate, 10 mM
magnesium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.1% SDS at 37°C with
shaking (18). The supernatant was centrifuged in a Costar spin-X 0.22
Mm cellulose acetate filter unit to remove residual gel fragments. DNA
was precipitated with ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and
resuspended in water. The DNA resulting from a 350-Ml polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) reaction was resuspended in 15 Ml of water.
Direct sequencing of double-stranded DNA. The sequencing reaction based on the dideoxy termination method of Sangeret al. (19) was
performed using Sequenase 2.0 sequencing kit (United States Biochem-

reactions. A I0-M1l reaction containing 7 Al of purified DNA, 2 Ml of
reaction buffer, and 25 pmol of the appropriate primer was incubated
at 950C for 4 min and immediately transferred to a dry ice-ethanol bath
for 1 min. Immediately after thawing, a mixture containing 1 Al of Mn
buffer, 1 Al of [35S]dATP, 2 Al of a 1:20 dilution of labeling mix, 1 Al of
dithiothreitol, and 2 sl of a 1:8 dilution of Sequenase enzyme was
added. The labeling reaction was performed for 8 min at room temperature. Termination was performed for 5 min as described by the manufacturer except that it was performed at 40'C. Sequencing reactions
were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gels. Gels were transferred onto Whatman Inc. (Clifton, NJ) 3MM paper, dried, and autoradiographed with Kodak X-OMAT AR film.
Identification of SSCP. DNA amplification was performed as described above, except that the reaction volume was scaled down to 10 Ml
and contained 4 MCi of [35SJdATP. 1 vol of PCR product was mixed
with 3 vol of a solution containing 95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA,
0.05% bromophenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol. 5 Ml of this mixture was heated at 950C for 4 min and loaded onto 6% nondenaturing
polyacrylamide gel (49:1, acrylamide:NN'-methylene bisacrylamide)
containing 5% glycerol in 0.5 x Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. Electrophoresis was carried out in 0.5 x Tris-borate-EDTA buffer at room temperature at 20 W of constant power for 11 h for segment 3 and 6 h for the
other segments (20, 21). Gels were transferred onto Whatman 3MM
paper, dried, and autoradiographed with Kodak X-OMAT AR film.
Restriction enzyme studies. 10 U of the appropriate enzyme were
mixed with 20 Al of PCR product. The mixture was incubated at 370C
for 4 h (Fok I) or overnight (Ma IV). The digested product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.

Results

Tritiatedfatty acid oxidation by intactfibroblast monolayers.

We assayed (3-oxidation flux in patients' fibroblasts using
[9,10(n)-3HJ-palmitate and -myristate as (-oxidation substrates (Table II). [3H]palmitate oxidation measures oxidation
flux of medium- and long-chain fatty acids, whereas [3H]myristate oxidation reflects more sensitively impaired me-

dium-chain fatty acid oxidation. All patients with severe neonatal onset GA II had very low [3H]palmitate oxidations, with
values ranging from 2% to 22% of the control mean. [3H]myristate oxidation was also significantly impaired for these
same patients, with values of 2-26% of control. For all but
patient 1728, [3H]palmitate oxidation was more impaired
than was that of [3H] myristate. All these values are consistent
with the severe generalized block in intramitochondrial acylcoenzyme A dehydrogenation and (3-oxidation observed in severe neonatal onset GA II. Late-onset GA II patients 1903 and
1966 yielded distinctly different results. In patient 1903, [3H]palmitate oxidation approached the normal range (2 60% of
control) at 55% of control, whereas [3H]myristate oxidation
was more clearly abnormal at 31% of control. In patient 1966,
both [3H]palmitate and [3H]myristate oxidations were normal at 79% and 107% of control, respectively. These findings
are consistent with their mild clinical phenotypes (2).
Immunoprecipitation of ETF subunits. In GA II fibroblasts, we radiolabeled newly synthesized ETF polypeptides
and immunoprecipitated the labeled molecules with anti-ETF
antiserum. The experiments were repeated independently two
to six times for each patient, with consistent results. Two bands
of the expected sizes (33 and 30 kD for a- and (3-ETF subunits,
respectively) were seen after SDS-PAGE of immunoprecipitated samples from control cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 5). These two
bands were not seen when an excess of unlabeled pig ETF was
added to the immunoprecipitation mixture before the addition
of the antiserum or when preimmune serum was used in place
of anti-ETF antiserum, confirming that these two bands were
indeed the a- and (3-ETF subunits. In multiple experiments,
both subunits were detected in patients 1728, 1803, 1903, and
1966 with no gross alterations in size or amount of either (Fig.
1 B, lanes 1, 3, 7, and 8). Although immunoprecipitation of
samples from patient 9001 also revealed that both subunits
were synthesized, the amount of a subunit synthesized appeared less than in control cells (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). Both subunits were markedly decreased in samples from patient 1863
(Fig. 1 A, lane 1). Neither a nor ,8 subunits were consistently
detected in samples from patients 1430 and 1916 (Fig. 1 A,
lanes 3 and 6).

tide changes, including point mutations (7-9). Samples containing a base change appear on DGGE either as a single band
ofabnormal migration when homozygous or as multiple bands
(usually four bands corresponding to two homoduplexes and
two heteroduplexes) when heterozygous (.17). The entire coding region of the gene was amplified in five overlapping segments selected to contain only one melting domain when analyzed by perpendicular GC-clamped DGGE. Sequences of the
five pairs of primers, size of the amplified product, PCR and
DGGE conditions are indicated in Table I. Agarose gel analysis
of the amplified products revealed a single band ofthe expected
size in all 13 control and 6 GA II cell lines, except for patient
1916 which showed two bands when segment 5 was amplified,
one of the expected size and a second, smaller one. Analysis of
the different DNA fragments by DGGE revealed a marked
molecular heterogeneity of GA II. The entire procedure (RNA
isolation, cDNA synthesis, amplification, and DGGE analysis), was repeated independently at least twice for each segment
from each patient, with identical results in each case. Analysis
of segment 1 failed to reveal a mutation in any ofthe eight GA
II patients (data not shown). Analysis of segment 2 showed
that patient 1803 was heterozygous for a mutation (Fig. 2).
This abnormal DGGE pattern was not seen in any of the 13
control or the 7 other GA II patients. Analysis of segment 3 of
patient 1430 indicated the presence of two different mutations,
one on each allele (Fig. 3). Neither ofthese changes were present in the other GA II or control samples. However, a different
DGGE pattern for segment 3 was found in four of the control
cultures, suggesting that they were heterozygous for a normal
polymorphism. DGGE analysis ofsegment 4 indicated the presence of an identical mutation in GA II patients 1728, 9001,
1803, and 1863 (Fig. 4). This mutation was homozygous in
patient 1728 and heterozygous in the three other patients. In
patient 9001, the data indicated the presence of a different mutation on the other allele within the same segment (segment 4).
Analysis of segment 5 showed that patients 1916 and 9001 were
heterozygous for different mutations (Fig. 5). DGGE analysis
of the five DNA segments from patients 1903 and 1966 did not
reveal any nucleotide changes.
SSCP analysis of pre-a-ETF gene. SSCP is a simple and
sensitive alternative assay to DGGE for detecting single nucleotide changes (20). The principles of the techniques are different, making them complementary. In SSCP, a labeled sinU2

gle-stranded DNA fragment is electrophoresed on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel; a nucleotide change alters its
secondary structure and thus its mobility in the gel. SSCP analysis of all five DNA segments did not detect any additional mutations (data not shown). Moreover, SSCP analysis of segment
3 indicated that patient 1430 was heterozygous for only one
mutation, missing the mutation in the other allele detected by
DGGE analysis within the same segment.
Sequence analysis. The DNA fragments shown by DGGE
analysis to contain nucleotide changes were sequenced. Some
DNA samples were first purified by agarose gel electrophoresis.
In other cases, we separated both alleles on DGGE and sequenced them independently. Sequencing was done at least
twice for each patient. In all cases, the DNA sequence obtained
exactly matched the published sequence except for the mutations (Fig. 6). The nucleotide changes detected by sequencing
in controls and GA II patients are summarized in Table III.
Sequencing of segment 2 from patient 1803 revealed a heterozygous G to A transition at position 346, changing a glycine
residue to an arginine at codon 116 (Glyl 16Arg; Fig. 6 A). 4 of
13 controls, but no GA II patients, were shown on DGGE to be
heterozygous for a change in segment 3. Sequencing this DNA
segment showed a heterozygous C to T transition at nucleotide
512, replacing a threonine with an isoleucine at codon 171
(Thri 7 1Ile; data available on request). DGGE analysis of segment 3 from patient 1430 showed a pattern consistent with the
presence of a different base change in each allele. Indeed, sequencing the lowest band revealed an 18-bp deletion (nucleotides 453 to 470), removing six amino acids (codons 152 to
157: dell 52-157; Fig. 6 B). Sequencing the other band showed
a T to G transversion at position 470, causing a valine to glycine change at codon 157 (Val 1 57Gly; Fig. 6 C). The 18-bp
deletion did not allow the formation of heteroduplexes with the
allele containing the 470 transversion, consistent with only two
homoduplex bands being observed on DGGE.
On the basis of the DGGE analysis of segment 4, the same
nucleotide change was present in both alleles from patient 1728
and in one allele from patients 1863, 1803, and 9001. Sequencing the PCR product from patient 1728 revealed homozygous
C to T transitions at position 797, replacing a threonine residue

9001 confirmed the presence of a homoduplex for this same
mutation. Sequencing revealed that the other mutation detected by DGGE in segment 4 from patient 9001 was a deletion
encompassing nucleotides 808-810 or nucleotides 809-811,
and resulting in the deletion ofvaline at codon 270 (delVal270;

detected by agarose gel electrophoresis of segment 5 from patient 1916 showed a 66-bp deletion in frame from nucleotides

273-294 (del273-294; Fig. 6 E). Again, this deletion did not
allow heteroduplex formation with the wild-type allele, explaining the presence of only two homoduplex bands on
DGGE analysis.

Glutaric Acidemia Type II: Mutations

Restriction endonuclease studies. We designed restriction
endonuclease assays to provide an alternative to DGGE analysis for detecting some ofthe nucleotide changes described. The
Thr 71 Ie change found in four control cell lines removed a
Fok I restriction site. As expected, agarose gel electrophoresis of
Fok I digested segment 3 DNA from cells without this mutation produced loss of the 382 6bp band (Fig. 7 A, lane 3) and
appearance of new bands, consistent with sizes of 178 and 208
bp (Fig. 7 A, lane 4). In contrast, in digested segment 3 DNA
from four cultures with this transition, an additional band was
seen consistent with a size of 382 bp, corresponding to the
uncut homoduplex (Fig. 7 A, lane 4). This result independently confirmed that those four cultures are heterozygous for
the Thri 7 1le mutation.
Because the dell 52-157 or the Val I57Gly mutations did
not create or remove any known cutting sites, we designed an
antisense primer to be used with primer 3/i to introduce a
restriction site in this region. The primer was a 25-mer encompassing G471 to G495 in which G474 and T475 were replaced
with two C. This modification introduced a Nla IV restriction
site when either of the two mutations was present, but not in
the amplified product from normal cells. Electrophoresis analysis of the Nla IV digested DNA from patient 1430 confirmed
the coexistence of both the del 152-157 and Val I57Gly mutations (Fig. 7 B: lanes 2 and 4).
Similarly, neither the Thr266Met nor the deletion of codon
270 produced a restriction site change. We designed a 30-mer
primer encompassing T747 to A796 in the sense strand, in

PCR products was incubated overnight at 37°C with 10 U of NlaIV.
The undigested (lanes I and 2) and digested (lanes 3 and 4) products

del152-157 predicts the presence of two bands of 201- and 183-bp
sizes after electrophoresis of undigested PCR product amplified from
patient 1430 (lane 2). Because the Vall57Gly and dell52-157 mutations create a NlaIV site, NlaIV digestion of the PCR product derived from patient 1430 is expected to give two products of 178- and

which A794 was replaced with a G. Amplification with this
primer and with primer 4/2 produced a 64-bp fragment containing a Fok I restriction site when the Thr266Met was present
in the template. As predicted, products amplified from normal
template and analyzed on a 5% NuSieve GTG agarose gel remained intact on Fok I digestion. In contrast, the 64 bp product from patient 1728 was completely cut. Digestion of products amplified from patients 1803 and 1863 only partially cut
the 64-bp fragment, confirming heterozygosity for the
Thr266Met mutation. Digestion of products amplified from
patient 9001 also partially cut the original fragment. However,
the uncut fragment was slightly smaller than the uncut fragments from control cells or from patients 1803 or 1863. These
data confirm the presence of the Thr266Met change in one
allele and of the deletion of codon 270 in the other in patient
9001 (results not shown).

Discussion
In this study, we investigated metabolic, polypeptide, and genetic heterogeneity in eight GA II patients. d-Oxidation flux
was severely defective in the six early onset GA II patients and
intermediate or normal in two patients with late-onset disease.
The results of our biosynthetic studies correlated well with both
the clinical and metabolic phenotypes. ETF polypeptide levels
were decreased or absent in four of the six early onset GA II
patients, and normal in the remaining two early-onset patients
and the two late-onset patients. We also identified point mutations and deletions in the pre-a-ETF cDNA in all six patients
with early-onset GA II, but no mutations in the two late-onset
patients.
We can correlate metabolic, polypeptide, and genetic variations in these GA II patients. Patients 1903 and 1966 both
presented with a late-onset form of GA II. Patient 1903 had a
clinical presentation limited to the neurological system and
only excreted small amounts of typical GA II metabolites,
whereas patient 1966 had an extremely mild clinical and biochemical GA II presentation. Whereas Loehr et al. (2) could
not correlate their residual ETF activities with their clinical
phenotypes, our tritiated fatty acid assays clearly separated patients 1903 and 1966 from the other GA II patients. Indeed,
although ETF activities in patients 1903 and 1966 were decreased to 6% and 2% of control, respectively, 3H-fatty acid
oxidations were intermediate in patient 1903 and normal in
patient 1966. We have made analogous observations previously in long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency, where clinical severities correlated well with [3H]palmitate oxidations, but not with enzyme activities, suggesting that tritiated fatty acid assays reflect more closely the actual
physiologic fl-oxidation flux (22). Patients 1903 and 1966 also
synthesized normal amounts of a- and fl-ETF polypeptides
and had no pre-a-ETF cDNA mutations detected by DGGE
and SSCP.
The six early-onset GA II patients had generally similar
clinical and biochemical phenotypes and very low 3H-fatty acid
oxidations in fibroblasts, consistent with their severe GA II
phenotypes. In contrast to the biosynthesis studies done by
Tanaka and co-workers (3), we radiolabeled the cells for a
longer period of time (12 h instead of 1 h). Our results probably reflect the steady-state level of the ETF heterodimer,
whereas experiments with shorter radiolabeling periods reflect

synthesis of nascent polypeptides. This experimental difference
explains why we did not detect the (3 subunit in all three patients lacking the a subunit, consistent with the suggestion by
Indo et al. (6) that intramitochondrial 3l-ETF becomes unstable unless bound to a-ETF. Indeed, we detected neither the a
nor the ,3 subunits in patients 1430 and 1916, in agreement
with the immunoblotting results ofLoehr et al. (2), which also
reflect ETF steady-state levels. Our finding decreased levels of
both a and (3 subunits in patient 1863 and normal levels of both
in patients 1728 and 1803, also agree with the results of Loehr
et al. (2). In contrast, the biosynthesis experiments in 1430's
fibroblasts by Ikeda et al. (3) demonstrated faint radiolabeling
of a-ETF but normal j3-ETF biosynthesis. Patients 1430 and
1916 each have one a-ETF allele with in-frame deletions of 6
and 22 amino acids, respectively. This could explain the relative instability of the a-ETF subunit and hence the lack of
mature heterodimer in these patients.
We can also make some conclusions regarding the effects of
individual point mutations on the stability of the a-ETF subunit. Since patient 1728 is homozygous for the Thr266Met
mutation, this mutation, in and of itself, must produce an inactive but stable a-ETF subunit capable of forming a mature
heterodimer, since both the earlierimmunoblotting studies (2)
and our biosynthetic studies show normal amounts of a- and
fl-ETF subunits in this patient. The Glyl l6Arg mutation
found in one allele of patient 1803 also does not destabilize the
a-ETF subunit. Patient 9001 is heterozygous for the
Thr266Met mutation and for a deletion of codon 270. It is
likely that this deletion produces an unstable a-ETF responsible for the decreased amount of this subunit observed in the
immunoprecipitation studies.
GC-clamped DGGE is a sensitive technique for detecting
nearly all nucleotide changes. With this technique we identified
nucleotide changes in both pre-a-ETF alleles from four patients and in one allele from two early-onset GA II patients. In
the two ETF deficient late-onset GA II patients, no base change
was detected. None of the identified changes were detected in
13 control cell lines. Moreover, comparison with the published
rat pre-a-ETF cDNA sequence (23), modified to include the
G likely missing at nucleotide 867 (24), showed that all the
amino acids deleted or modified by these changes were conserved amino acids. This suggests that all the nucleotide
changes identified are mutations responsible for GA II. The
Thr266Met substitution was found in four unrelated patients
and appears to be the most common mutation responsible for
GA II, whereas the other mutations were identified only in
single patients. DGGE and SSCP analyses of segment 4 of patient 1728 indicated homozygosity for the Thr266Met substitution. Since we amplified cDNA and not genomic DNA, we
can not exclude the presence of another mutation in the second
allele producing an unstable RNA or defective transcription.
However, both our immunoprecipitation results and the immunoblotting results by Loehr et al. (2) revealed normal amounts
of a-ETF, suggesting that both alleles carry the Thr266Met
mutation. We do not know if this patient results from a consanguinous union.
A mutation can be missed by DGGE analysis when two
widely separated melting domains are present in the fragment
analyzed. Ifthe domain with the higher melting point contains
only a few nucleotides, its melting may not produce a marked
shift in mobility and its presence may not be detected by
DGGE. This situation is illustrated in the DGGE analysis of

segment 5 in patients 9001, 1863, 1728 and 1803. Although the
C to T transition at position 797 was present in the amplified
DNA segment 5 from these four patients, this mutation was
not detected by DGGE analysis of this segment. The first bases
adjacent to primer 5.1 belong to a small melting domain of
much higher melting point than the rest of segment 5. Indeed,
perpendicular DGGE of a DNA fragment amplified with
primers 4.1 and 5.2 showed the presence of two melting domains with melting points of 53% and 35%. It appears likely
that the first bases of segment 5 actually belong to the same
melting domain as segment 4. This illustrates the importance
of amplifying overlapping DNA segments when performing
DGGE analysis.
Patient 1430 has been previously studied by Indo et al. (6).
They concluded that this patient (their YH 1313) was homozygous for a T to G transversion at nucleotide 470. However, we
identified this same mutation in only one allele from this patient, and found an 18-bp deletion in the other allele. Indo et al.
devised a PCR method to detect the 470 transversion using an
upstream primer encompassing T443 to G469. This primer
would have been unable to anneal to the allele containing the
453-470 deletion. This would have resulted in the amplification of only the allele with the transversion, leading them to
conclude that patient 1430 was homozygous for the 470 transversion. In patients 1863 and 1916, only one allele appeared to
carry a mutation, while the other was identical to the wild type.
Other possible explanations is that the undetected mutation
involves the regulatory sequences of the gene that we did not
analyze or deletions precluding PCR amplification of one or
several of our cDNA segments. Alternatively, a mutation in the
coding sequence could have been missed by our DGGE assay.
DGGE analysis can miss nucleotide changes present in both
alleles in which the mutant homoduplex migrates at the same
position as the wild type homoduplex. This is illustrated by the
G to A transition detected in segment 2 from patient 1803. The
wild-type and mutant homoduplexes were only separated with
a 10% denaturant gradient, but not with the usual 25% gradient.
In two ETF-deficient late onset GA II patients (1903 and
1966), no changes were detected by our DGGE and SSCP assays. This result can be explained by a mutation located in
regulatory sequences or by a mutation in the coding sequence
undetected by our assay. Alternatively, these patients may have
a mutation in the gene coding for the (3 subunit of ETF. Although most of the ETF defects involve the a-subunit, some
patients have been described with # subunit defects (25). In
addition to the mutations detected in GA II patients, we also
identified a polymorphism in four normal controls. This polymorphism replaces a threonine for an isoleucine at codon 171.
We did not find any cell cultures homozygous for this base
change. Because all our control cultures demonstrated normal
tritiated palmitate oxidation (data available on request), we
can not predict the functional consequences of this nucleotide
change being present on both alleles. However, since we found
this mutation in 4 of our 13 controls and not in any GA II
patients, it is unlikely that this change would produce GA II.
Further studies are needed to clarify this point.
We used two other techniques besides DGGE to reveal nucleotide changes in the pre-a-ETF sequence in these patients.
SSCP revealed no additional mutations in any segment of this
coding sequence. SSCP appeared slightly less sensitive than
DGGE, in that it missed the Val257Gly mutation found in
Glutaric Acidemia Type II: Mutations

patient 1430, as well as the segment 5 C to T transition at
position 797. SSCP analysis also confirmed the DGGE results
that only one allele carries a mutation in patients 1863 and
1916. Restriction endonuclease analyses of amplified DNA
segments also confirmed the existence of the Thrl 7 llle mutation in the normal controls, the deletions of codons 152-157
and Vall 57Gly mutations in patient 1430, both the homozygous and heterozygous Thr266Met mutations in patients 1728
and 1803/ 1863, respectively, as well as the Thr266Met and the
codon 270 deletion in patient 9001. These results confirm the
accuracy and sensitivity of DGGE in detecting nucleotide
changes responsible for genetic diseases. This simple and sensitive technique allowed us to rapidly screen the pre- a-ETF gene
for mutations causing GA II. Identification of mutations responsible for GA II should help our understanding ofthe interactions between the a- and f3-ETF subunits, the various acylcoenzyme A dehydrogenases and ETF-QO.
