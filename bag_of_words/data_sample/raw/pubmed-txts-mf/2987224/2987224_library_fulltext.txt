RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Functional competence of this patient’s @-globin genecontaining theTATA box mutation (ATAAAA to ATACAA) was
monitored relative to a reference @-gene using transient
expression assays in HeLa cells (6,8,9). An a-globin control
was co-transfected with each gene to monitor for variations
in transfection efficiency, total RNA was isolated after 48 h,
and globin-gene transcripts were detected following annealing
to labeled probes and S1 nuclease digestion.
A sensitive S1 nuclease mapping procedure was employed
using radiolabeled probes of high specific activity for monitoring globin-genetranscripts in thesecells. The method takes
advantage of the 3’-exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase to “nibble” in from the 3‘ end of a DNA fragment in
the absence of added deoxynucleoside triphosphates (12).
“Nibbling” of a cloned genomic DNA fragment is allowed to
proceed until theDNA strand complementary to exon 1,IVS1,
and a portion of exon 2 of the @-globingene is digested (see
“Materials and Methods”). This region is then repaired by
addition of three cold (dA,dG, and TTP) and
one radioactive
triphosphate (dCTP),followed by a cold chase with unlabeled
dCTP tomake the probe full-length. Annealing of this probe
to globin mRNA under R-loop conditions followedby S1
nuclease digestion results in S1-resistant radioactive RNA-

FIG.1. Transient expression of normal and mutant TATA box-containing human @-globingenes in
HeLa cells. The genes were introduced into HeLa cells. Followingtransient expression, RNA was extracted and
globin-gene transcripts were monitored using an S1 nuclease assay as described under “Materials and Methods.”
Resistant fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a high resolution denaturing acrylamide gel, and their
size was determined relative to end-labeled markers made from &XHue111 (lane 1) and pBR322 HpaII (lane 10)
digests. S1-resistant fragments (16-h exposure) from varying levels (25, 5, 2.5, 0.5, and 0 ng) of total reticulocyte
RNA isolated from a patient with sickle cell anemia are shown in lanes 2-6. Results are shown on probing total
RNA (7.5 pg) from HeLa cells following transient expression of an a-gene containing plasmid together with the
cloned normal @-globingene (lane 7), TATA box mutant (lane 8), and the expression vector SVpBR328 (lane 9).
Expression of the a-globin internal control wasused to monitor relative transfection efficiency, and RNA
preparations were simultaneously probed for both @- and a-globin transcripts (lanes 7-9,2.5-h exposure). S1resistant fragment sizes correspond to those expected from DNA sequence analysis (5,13, 14) (i.e. 143 nucleotides
from cap site of @ to 5’ splice of IVSI, 222 nucleotides for exon 2 of (3,and 113 nucleotides from the HinfI site in
a a t position +20 to the5’ splice of IVS1).
