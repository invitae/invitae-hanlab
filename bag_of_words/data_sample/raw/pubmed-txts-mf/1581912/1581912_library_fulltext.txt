Abstract
Recent evidence has implicated germ-line mutations of the p53 gene
as the cause of cancer susceptibility in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome,
associated with the development of breast cancer and other neoplasms.
Furthermore, somatic mutations of the p53 gene have been detected in a
high percentage of non-familial breast cancers. We therefore sought to
identify potential carriers of p53 gene mutations in a cohort of patients
with early onset breast cancer. We examined 126 consecutive patients
who developed breast cancer at or before the age of 40 for mutations of
p53 within conserved regions of the gene. One patient with an inherited
germ-line mutation of the pS3 gene was identified but the functional
significance of this mutation was not clear. It thus appears that only a
small percentage of patients with breast cancer under the age of 40 carry
germ-line mutations of the p53 gene, an observation which has implica
tions for potential screening and risk assessment in such patients.

Consenting patients provided 10 ml of peripheral blood for DNA
isolation, completed a questionnaire about their personal health and
family history, and agreed to a review of their medical record. All
patients provided consent according to institutional standards. One
hundred thirty-two patients were enrolled and 6 were invaluable or
ineligible for the following reasons: 2 refused blood drawing after initial
consent, 2 had intraductal cancer without evidence of invasion, 1 was
41 years of age at diagnosis, and DNA from 1 patient was not success
fully amplified. These patient were excluded from further analysis,
leaving a total of 126 Ã©valuablepatients.
Laboratory Methods. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated
from blood and DNA isolated as described (13). A portion of the p53
gene including exons 5 to 8 was then amplified by the polymerase chain
reaction using primer A (5'-GTAGGAATTCACTTGTGCCCTGACTT-3' and primer B (5'-CATCGAATTCTGGAAACTTTCCACTTGAT-3'). The PCR2 product was subcloned into Lambda Zap

Introduction
The p53 gene is now recognized as the most commonly
mutated gene so far identified in human cancer (1), found in
tumors of the colon (2), lung (3, 4), breast (3, 5, 6), ovary (7),
bladder (8), brain (3, 9) and other sites. These mutations are
generally thought to be somatic, although in many cases this
has not been directly demonstrated. In contrast, inherited p53
gene mutations have recently been reported in patients with the
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (10, 11). These patients have strong
family histories of several tumor types, particularly leukemias,
sarcomas, brain tumors, and breast cancers. Furthermore, the
risk of developing breast cancer before the age of 45, in affected
females, is 18-fold over the general population (12). As in other
inherited cancer susceptibility syndromes, the mode of inherit
ance appears to be autosomal dominant and more than 50% of
affected patients develop cancers before the age of 50 ( 12). On
the basis of these results, we sought to determine how frequently
germ-linep53 gene mutations occurred in breast cancer patients
without the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Accordingly, a group of
young women who had breast cancer at or before the age of 40
years were screened for the presence of constitutional mutations
of p53. Results, reported below, show that such mutations are
rare.
Materials

and Methods

Patient Population. Consecutive women with invasive breast cancer
of any stage diagnosed at <40 years of age who presented to the Johns
Hopkins Oncology Center or the Frederick Regional Cancer Therapy
Center for new evaluation or ongoing management between February
22 and July 12, 1991 were eligible for this study. Greater than 90% of
patients fulfilling these criteria were identified and agreed to participate.

(Stratagene), packaged, and plated at high density. Pooled clones were
sequenced as described (3, 8). Any mutations that were identified were
verified through an independent amplification followed by resequencing. For screening of the newly identified mutation at codon 181, a
smaller fragment of the p53 gene was amplified by the PCR, using
primer A and primer C (5'-CATCGAATTCCACTGACAACCACCCTT-3'). This PCR product was digested with Hae\\ and the
products were separated by electrophoresis through a 7.5% acrylamide
gel.

Results
The characteristics of the patient population are shown in
Table 1. The mean age at first diagnosis of breast cancer was
35.0 Â±4.0 years. Tumor descriptors at the time of diagnosis,
including TNM status and tumor estrogen and progesterone
receptor content were within the expected range for this young
patient group. Thirty-eight % (48 of 126) of patients gave a
history of cancer other than skin cancer in one or more firstdegree relatives. Seventeen patients (13%) had a mother with
breast cancer with a mean age at diagnosis of 48 Â±12 years;
one patient had a sister with breast cancer. Family history was
not available for two women who were adopted at birth. In
addition, 11 patients (9%) had a personal history of a second
cancer, including contralateral breast cancer in 4 patients. Only
one patient was found to harbor a variant p53 alÃ-ele.This
patient was found to have breast cancer at the age of 33 and
subsequently developed a melanotic spindle cell cancer of the
mediastinum at the age of 35. Her maternal grandmother
developed unilateral postmenopausal breast cancer at the age
of 72 and her mother developed bilateral breast cancers in her
late forties (Fig. 1). The patient's healthy 27-year-old sister had
undergone bilateral prophylactic mastectomies at the age of 25
because of the propensity for breast cancer development in her
family. Pathological examination of her breast tissue showed
only mild fibrocystic changes. A sequencing gel documenting
the mutation in this patient is shown in Fig. 2. A point mutation

substitution.
To determine if the mutation was inherited, we examined
DNA from the patient's sister. To facilitate this analysis, we
took advantage of the fact that the codon 181 mutation abro
gated a Haell site. A small portion of the p53 gene was
amplified from the patient, sister, and controls, and the prod
ucts were digested with the Haell. Control DNA samples
produced a single 260-base pair fragment in this assay, while
DNA from the affected patient produced an additional 280base pair fragment (Fig. 3, Lanes 1 and 2, respectively). The
patient's sister was found to have the same 280-base pair
fragment following Hae\\ digestion, indicating that she was a
carrier of the identical p53 change (Fig. 3, Lane 3). It was thus
clear that this change appeared to be inherited and did not
represent a spontaneous mutation in the proband. Unfortu
nately no other family members were available for testing to
further define the mode of inheritance.
Discussion
Only 1 of 126 patients with early onset breast cancer appeared
to carry a germ-line change of the p53 gene. It is noteworthy

the mutant alÃ-ele(290 base pairs) to the wild-type alÃ-ele(270 base pairs) in Lanes

that we chose a laborious method (sequencing pooled clones)
for assessing the prevalence of such mutations in these patients.
Although this method is time consuming, we believe its sensi
tivity for detecting localized mutations within the regions stud
ied is nearly 100%. In contrast, "screening" techniques for such
mutations, such as single-stranded conformational analysis
(14), RNase protection (15, 16), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (17), and chemical cleavage of mismatched bases
(18), are less labor intensive but are also less sensitive. We
considered it possible that a screening technique might not
detect a particular p53 gene associated with early onset breast
cancer, and therefore elected a more laborious sequencing ap
proach. The region sequenced encompassed the site of over
95% of somatic p53 mutations previously discovered (including
those in sporadic breast cancers), and would have detected all
mutations previously identified in the germ line of Li-Fraumeni
patients. It would not have detected mutations in other regions
of the p53 gene outside of the sequenced exons (19).
The one patient we identified with a constitutional p53 var
iant did not have a clinical history typical of those described
with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The change in this patient
resulted in a substitution of cysteine for arginine, a nonconservative amino acid change likely to have significant effects on
protein structure. Moreover, the arginine at codon 181 is highly
conserved among mammalian p53 genes (20), suggesting that
its conservation is important for normal function. The p53
coding region, in general, is not highly conserved, but the great
majority of mutations are at conserved positions (1). It must be
emphasized, however, that we have no direct evidence showing
that the codon 181 change had a functional effect. It is possible
that it is a rare variant distributed within the normal population
and has no association with the breast cancer predisposition
identified in this family.
The young age of the cohort studied was chosen to increase
the likelihood of including patients who had an increased sus
ceptibility to cancer. At most, however, one mutation was
observed in the 126 patients. It is possible that additional
patients had mutations outside the sequenced exons, but there
was little precedent for this possibility in previous studies of
p53 (1). One decision that must be made in the coming years
concerns the advisability of analyzing the p53 sequence of
patients with breast cancer for the purpose of family counseling.
Our studies suggest that, even when very young patients are
considered (those most likely to have a genetic predisposition),
the incidence of such mutations is quite low, and the informa
tion obtained would not be useful to the great majority of
patients studied. Only when an unusual medical history is
apparent, suggestive of a typical Li-Fraumeni syndrome, would

such examinations seem warranted
