Article abstract-A
7-month-old boy died in a demented state after a clinical history characterized by generalized seizures,
psychomotor deterioration, and fumaric aciduria. We found a marked deficiency of both mitochondrial and cytosolic fumarases
in skeletal muscle, brain, cerebellum, heart, kidney, liver, and cultured fibroblasts. Fumarase activities were 30 to 50% compared
with controls in both mitochondria and cytosol from cultured fibroblasts of the parents. Antifumarase cross-reacting material
was present in negligible amounts in the patient’s tissues. Our data indicate that this disease is an autosomal recessive
encephalopathy, due to a single mutation affecting the gene encoding both forms of the enzyme.

The mitochondrial myopathies, or encephalomyopathies, with known biochemical defects are classified
into different groups on the basis of the defective mitochondrial function (ie, defects of transport, substrate
utilization, Krebs’ cycle, respiratory chain, and oxidation-phosphorylation coupling).’Two cases of infantile
progressive encephalopathy due t o deficiency of
fumarase (EC 4.2.1.2), a Krebs’ cycle enzyme, have been
reported so far.2.3Excessive amounts of fumaric and
succinic acids were present in their urines.
In addition, 2 adult siblings with mental retardation
had fumaric aciduria, but fumarase was not measured in
their cells.4 Two different fumarase isoenzymes, 1 located in the mitochondrial matrix, the other in the
cytosol, are present in all mammalian tissues, with the
exception of the brain, where only the mitochondrial
form has been identified.5 Genetic data suggest that, in
mammals, a common gene, located in man on chromosome 1, encodes both fumarase isoenzymes.6-8We
present a study of a 7-month-old infant with a fatal
encephalopathy, fumaric aciduria, and generalized
fumarase deficiency, affecting the cytosolic as well as
the mitochondrial isoenzymes. His parents were
heterozygous for the enzyme defect. Our work strongly
supports the view2p3that human fumarase deficiency is
due to an autosomal recessive mutation affecting a single gene.

Case report. The propositus was born at the 38th week of
gestation by cesarean section. The parents were not consanguineous. His only brother died at 2 days of age of acute
respiratory distress. Birth weight was 2,730 grams, and head
circumference 34.5 cm. The baby developed well until 2112
months when partial seizures were noticed. Seizures were
characterized by clonic movements of the left eyelid, upward
gaze deviation, retroflexion of the neck, and automatic sucking and swallowing. The child was admitted at the Department of Pediatrics of the University of Padova. Neurologic
examination revealed a lethargic baby with permanent deviation of gaze and head to the left side. Marked hypotonia and
delayed psychomotor development were present. Blood and
CSF were normal, except for a mild metabolic acidosis (pH
7.33, HCO, 21 mEq/l, base excess [BE] -4.2 mEq/l); blood
lactate was 3.6 mM (normal, >2.0 mM). Gas liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis of urinary organic acids revealed
marked fumaric aciduria (see Results). EEG showed an abnormally slow background rhythm with multifocal spikes and spikeand-wave complexes, mostly of the left hemisphere. Seizures
were successfully controlled with Na-barbiturate 4 mg/kg/d, and
the patient was discharged. At 5’/z months of age, clusters of
seizures characterized by flexor and extensor spasms ensued.
C T showed diffuse cerebral atrophy with enlargement of lateral ventricles. After 2 weeks, he became extremely irritable
and dyspneic, and an acute pulmonary infection was diagnosed. The abnormal posture became permanent. Severe metabolic acidosis was present (pH 7.29, HCO, 15 mEq/l, BE
-9.5 mEq/l), with blood lactate up to 17.2 mM. Remission of

the infection and of the metabolic acidosis was accomplished
with antibiotic therapy. At age 7 months, he was admitted at the
Istituto Neurologico of Milano because of severe, progressive
psychomotor deterioration. Physical examination showed a
child in moderately good general condition, of normal weight and
height. Microcephaly and hypotonia, however, were prominent;
a mild degree of axial dystonia was present. Deep tendon reflexes
were absent. The child did not react to external stimuli, his
psychomotor organization was very poor, and he was in a vegetative state. GLC analysis of urinary organic acids revealed
fumaric and succinic aciduria (see Results). EEG showed a completely disorganizedbackground rhythm, with diffuse spikes and
spike-and-wave complexes. One week after admission he had
hyperpyrexia, vomiting, and massive repetitive myoclonic jerks.
Marked metabolic acidosis was found (pH 7.26, HCO:, 12 mEq/l,
BE - 12 mEq/l), with blood lactate 4.7 mM. He died 36 hours
later of heart failure.
An autopsy was performed. Gross examination of viscera
was normal. Inspection of the brain, however, showed microcephaly, hypomyelination, and islets of cell heterotopia,
mostly located in the cerebellum, as well as in the occipital and
parietal areas. The latter abnormality was also confirmed by
light microscopy examination (courtesy of Prof. 0. Bugiani,
Dept. of Neuropathology, Istituto Neurologico “C. Besta”).
Examination of the spinal cord was not performed.

Methods. Organic acids and carnitines. Radiochemical determination of plasma free and esterified carnitines was performed
as de~cribed.~
GLC analysis of urinary organic acids was carried out as previously reported: except for the following modifications: 4-heptyl benzoic acid (Aldrich Chimica, Milano)
was used as internal standard, and samples were derivatized
with N-methyl-N-(tert-butyl-dimethyl-silyl)
trifluoroacetamide (Pierce Chem., Oud Beijerland, The Netherlands).
Tissue homogenates and muscle mitochondria. Small samples (50 to 100 mg) of frozen brain cortex, cerebellar cortex,
liver, kidney, and heart from the patient and 2 age-matched
controls were rapidly thawed and homogenized with a Teflon
pestle in 10 volumes of 10 mM K phosphate, p H 7.4. Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 800 X g. The pellet
was discarded and the supernatant used for enzyme assay. In
some experiments, skeletal muscle and brain cortex from the
patient and controls were used for mitochondrial preparation.
Three grams of tissue were homogenized in 8 volumes of 20
mM Hepes, 100 mM KCl, 1mM Na, EDTA, 2 mM mercaptoethanol, 0.3% BSA, pH 7.4. Homogenates were used to
separate a mitochondrial and a cytosolic fraction, as described.1° Soluble proteins from the mitochondrial matrix
were obtained by centrifugation for 1 hour a t 100,000 X g of
sonicated mitochondria.
Fibroblast studies, Fibroblasts were cultured in modified
Eagle MEM supplemented with 10%fetal calf serum and used
for enzyme assay between subculture 5 and 15.” Enzyme
activities were measured in fibroblast extracts prepared by 2
cycles of freezing and thawing of freshly trypsinized cells,
suspended in 10 mM K phosphate, pH 7.4, and followed by 2
cycles of 5 seconds sonication in an ice bath. Fibroblast mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were prepared by the method
of Rhead and Tanaka,I2 modified by omitting the digitonin
step. Mitochondria from each cell line were obtained from 20
flasks (75 sq cm). Pelletted mitochondria were suspended in
300 pl of 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM Na, EDTA, p H 7.5, and
sonicated 3 X 10 sec at amplitude 12 pm. Sonicated mitochondria were centrifuged 1hour a t 100,000 X g, and the supernatant used for enzyme assay. The cytosolic fraction (15,000 X g
for 10 minutes) was tenfold concentrated on Amicon Y M30
membranes (Amicon Corporation, Danvers, MA) before enzyme assay.

Enzyme assay. Fumarase activity was measured in tissue
homogenates, fibroblast extracts, and fibroblast and muscle
mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions by monitoring spectrophotometrically at 240 nm and 25 “C the dehydration of Lmalate (50 mM final concentration) in K phosphate 50 mM,
pH 7.5, containing 1%K-cho1ate.I:’
Control cytosolic and mitochondrial enzyme activities
were measured a t 30 “C,according to the procedures described
for the following enzymes: malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and
NADP-dependent malic enzyme (ME),Io succinate dehydrogenase (SDH),I4 activated glutamate dehydrogenase
(GDH),l5 citrate synthetase (CS),I6lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH),I7 and activated pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
(PDHC).I8
Antibodies against fumarase and Western blots. Antibodies
against purified pig heart fumarase (Sigma Chem. Co., St.
Louis) were obtained by intradermal injection in rabbit of 1mg
of enzyme, mixed with complete Freund‘s adjuvant. Two
booster injections of 1 mg of enzyme mixed with incomplete
Freund’s adjuvant were given after 1and 3 weeks, respectively.
A week later the animal was bled, and the antiserum was stored,
in small aliquots, at -20 “C. Titration assay of the antibodies
showed that complete inhibition of 50 mU of purifiedpig heart
enzyme was obtained by 100 ~1 of immune serum. Immunoreactivity of rabbit antisera with the corresponding human
enzymes was established by Western blot analysis of human
cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions from different tissues,
obtained from controls. Solubilized proteins were separated
by 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters.Ig Immunostaining of
cross-reacting material (CRM) was performed by using a
1:100 dilution of our antifumarase antibody, as described.Ig
The rabbit antibody was highly reactive against a 45-kd protein corresponding to pig fumarase. A lower molecular-weight
band, a minor contaminant or a degradation product of the
commercial preparation, was also identified by our antibody.
However, the 45-kd band, corresponding to purified fumarase,
was the only protein recognized by the antibody in both the
mitochondrial and the cytosolic fractions obtained from several human tissues, suggesting that the 2 isozymes are composed of subunits of identical, or very close, molecular weights,
as recently shown in rat liver.E

Results. Organic acids and carnitines. GLC analysis of
urinary organic acids from the patient’s urine collected
at 3 months of age showed increased excretion of the
following acids: lactic 839 pg/mg creatinine, pyruvic
224, succinic 471, adipic 126, suberic 76, and fumaric
1,137 (highest values found in 20 normal controls aged 3
months to 3 years: lactic 90 pg/mg creatinine, pyruvic
20, succinic 90, adipic 25, suberic 20, fumaric 10).Analysis of samples taken a t 5 months and 7 months of age
gave similar results; in particular, succinic acid was 246
and 364, and fumaric acid was 195and 333 pg/mg creatinine. In these samples, however, an increase of malic
acid to 132 and 539 pg/mg creatinine was also present
(highest value for malate: 50 pg/mg creatinine). In the
last urine sample .collected during the fatal metabolic
attack, a-ketoglutarate was also increased to 1,023 pg/
mg creatinine (highest value for a-ketoglutarate: 80 pg/
mg creatinine). Plasma carnitines at 5 and 7 months of
age were the following: free carnitine 29.9 and 25.2
nmol/ml, short-chain esters 4.9 and 7.1, long-chain esters 0.9 and 1.2 (controls: free carnitine 38.0 5 10.1SD
nmol/ml, short-chain esters 6.8 +- 3.9 SD, long-chain
esters 1.5 k 0.7 SD).

Fumarase activity and Western blots. GLC analysis
suggested the presence of a block of the tricarboxylic
cycle at the level of fumarate hydratase enzyme. We
measured this activity in homogenates from autopsy
tissues of the patient and controls, as well as the activities of a control enzyme of the Krebs’ cycle, CS. CS
activities were in the same range in the brain, cerebellum, liver, kidney, and heart of the patient and controls. Fumarase activities, however, were 0.2% of the
controls’ mean in heart, liver, and kidney, and 2.5% of
the controls’ mean in cerebellum and brain of the patient (table l).,The defect of fumarase shown in the
autopsy tissues was confirmed by analysis of the patient’s cultured fibroblasts. Again, CS activity was normal, but fumarase activity was less than 1%of the mean
value of controls (table 1). Mixing experiments using
cell extracts from the patient and controls ruled out the
presence of soluble inhibitors (data not shown). Total
fumarase activities in fibroblast homogenates from the
child‘s parents were 42.3% and 52.6% of the mean of
controls in the father and the mother, respectively
(table 2). Fumarase activity measured in crude extracts
represents a combination of both the cytosolic and
mitochondrial forms, which are present in all tissues
except the brain.5 In order to ascertain whether the
parents were true heterozygotes for both isozymes, we

prepared mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions from
parents’ fibroblasts. Table 2 shows that the activities of
CS and LDH were comparable in the parents’ and controls’ cell subfractions. Moreover, the ratios of the specific activities of mitochondrial versus cytosolic CS and
of mitochondrial versus cytosolic LDH were similar in
the parents and the controls. However, fumarase activities of the parents were only 21% and 28% of the
control mean in mitochondria, and 42% of the control
mean in the cytosol (table 2). The distribution of
fumarase activity in controls was 155 f 77 SD
nmol/min in mitochondria, and 214 t 66 SD nmol/min
in the cytosol.
Similarly, to better clarify the origin of the enzyme
defect, we separated the mitochondrial and the
cytosolic fractions from brain and skeletal muscle of the
patient and 2 controls. In the cytosol from muscle,
fumarase was less than 1%of the controls’ mean, while
the activities of cytosolic MDH, NADP-dependent
ME, and LDH ranged from 38%to 90% of the controls’
mean values (table 3). In muscle mitochondria, we
found that patient’s fumarase was about 1%of that
found in controls. The activities of 6 mitochondrial
enzymes (CS, PDHC, GDH, MDH, ME, and SDH)
ranged from 33% to 61% of the mean value of controls’
mitochondria (table 3).
To understand whether the observed defects of both
mitochondrial and cytosolic fumarases were associated
with decreased amounts of the enzyme proteins, titration
of the corresponding CRM was performed by Westernblot analysis. Part A of the figure shows the results of
Western blot cytosolic fractions of heart and liver from
the patient and 1 control, immunostained by our antifumarase antibody. Fumarase-CRM was virtually undetectablein the patient’s heart, while a faint band, corresponding to fumarase, was barely detectable in the
patient’s liver. The results of Western blots for mitochondrial fumarase of the brain and muscle from the patient
and 1control are shown in the figure, part B. FumaraseCRM was undetectable in the patient’s brain and barely
detectable in the patient’s muscle mitochondria.

Discussion. Fumarase deficiency was reported in 2
infants with microcephaly, delayed development, hypotonia, and fumaric aciduria.2~~
One patient had virtually
absent fumarase activity in the cytosol and mitochondria and died at 8 months of age.2 The other child had
some residual activity in mitochondria and was still
alive at 6 months of age.3 We studied a 3rd patient who
developed epileptic seizures at 2 months, followed by
progressive psychomotor deterioration; at 5 months he
was demented, and he died at 7 months of a metabolic
attack.
Clinically, fumarase deficiency mainly affects the
human brain, as shown by our patient, as well as by
those previously described2s3all characterized by microcephaly, dementia, and epilepsy. The only noteworthy
pathologic findings of our patient were confined to the
brain. However, examination of the spinal cord was not
done (see Methods). Since the brain expresses only the
498 NEUROLOGY 40 March 1990

mitochondrial enzyme, the clinical phenotype of
fumarase deficiency can be defined as a mitochondrial
encephalopathy.’
Biochemically, our patient had fumaric aciduria associated with succinic aciduria and, occasionally, with
malic aciduria. Succinic aciduria, also reported in the 2
cases previously des~ribed,~J
was probably due to inhibition of glutamate and succinate oxidations in intact
mitochondria by the increased concentrations of fumarate.2 The increased concentration of malate found in
the urine of our patient was surprising, since malate is
the product of the fumarase reaction itself. A possible
explanation is that the block in tricarboxylic cycle
caused accumulation of acetylCoA in mitochondria.
AcetylCoA inhibits PDHC and stimulates pyruvate
carboxylase,lsthe net result being an increased production of oxaloacetate. The latter is easily transformed
into malate by MDH, a bidirectional enzyme. Alternatively, malate might be directly synthesized from
pyruvate by either the cytosolic or the mitochondrial
malic enzyme. The latter is strongly stimulated when
the mitochondrial concentrations of fumaric and succinic acids increase.1°
In the patient’s liver, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle,
and fibroblasts, fumarase was 1%or less as compared
with controls. A small residual activity was measurable
in brain and cerebellum. Mitochondrial and cytosolic
isozymes were equally affected, as demonstrated by the
enzyme assays in muscle subfractions (table 3), as well
as by Western blot analysis of mitochondrial and
cytosolic proteins from different organs (figure). Furthermore, the enzyme deficiency was specific since activities of other enzymes, measured in crude extracts,
were normal (table 1).We obtained similar results in
isolated mitochondria, although the slightly decreased
activities of some of the enzymes used as markers suggest that the organelles of the patient were partially
damaged (table 3).
Therefore, fumarase deficiency in our patient was
generalized to all tissues and affected, to the same degree, both the mitochondrial and the cytosolic isozymes. This is in contrast to the case reported by
Petrova-Benedict et a1,3 in which some 20% residual
mitochondrial activity was present. Since the enzyme
deficiency was expressed in the patient’s fibroblasts,
and the fibroblasts from his parents had approximately
50%of the activity of control cells, we conclude that the
disease, at least in this family, was due to an autosomal
recessive mutation.
In rat liver, SDS-PAGE shows a single band of approximately 45 kd for both fumarase isozymes.8,z0Both
isoforms appear to be homotetramers.20However, electrophoresis performed in nondenaturing conditions
shows that the cytosolic isoform is more anodic than
the mitochondrial isoform. Furthermore, detailed biochemical studies of limited proteolytic products of the 2
pig fumarases show slightly different peptide maps,
suggesting that the 2 isoforms differ in the N-terminal
residues (alanine for the mitochondrial, and glutamine,
or glutamate, for the cytosolic form).21More recent data
obtained in rat liver show that mitochondrial and
cytosolic fumarases are not only encoded by a single

gene but also have identical amino acid sequences.8
Similarly, data obtained from somatic cell hybrids suggest that also the 2 human isoforms are encoded by a
single gene, located on chromosome l.7This view is
strongly supported by our study, which indicates that
(1) an autosomal recessive disease causes deficiency of
both isozymes, (2) isozymes from different human
tissues show an identical electrophoretic mobility in
SDS-PAGE, (3) the parents of our patient had intermediate activity of both mitochondrial and cytosolic
fumarase.
The lack of antifumarase CRM in the patient's
tissues supports the hypothesis that the mutation at the
fumarase locus might either impair the transcription of
the gene or the translation of the corresponding
mRNA(s). Alternatively, the mutation might cause the
synthesis of an unstable, and possibly inactive, enzyme,
vulnerable to rapid degradation by cellular proteases.
Analogous to the situation in mammals, the 2 yeast
fumarases are encoded by a single gene,ssand mutations
at this locus cause the development of yeast strains
deficient in both the soluble and the mitochondrial
enzymes.22A human cDNA clone for liver fumarase has
been identified and made available for clinical studies.23
