Inactivation of both alleles of the RBI gene during normal retinal development initiates the formation of a
retinoblastoma (RB) tumor. To identify the mutations which inactivate RBI, 21 RB tumors isolated from 19
patients were analyzed with the polymerase chain reaction or an RNase protection assay or both. Mutations
were identified in 13 of 21 RB tumors; in 8 tumors, the precise errors in nucleotide sequence were
characterized. Each of four germ line mutations involved a small deletion or duplication, while three somatic
mutations were point mutations leading to splice alterations and loss of an exon from the mature RBI mRNA.
We were unable to detect expression of the mutant allele in lymphoblasts of three bilaterally affected patients,
although the mutation was present in the genomic DNA and transcripts containing the mutations were obvious
in the RB tumors in the absence of a normal RBI allele. The variations in the level of expression of mutant
transcripts suggest deregulation of RBI transcription in the absence of a functional RBI gene product.

The Knudson two-hit hypothesis (21) outlined the genetic
changes associated with the development of heritable and
nonheritable retinoblastoma (RB). In heritable cases, one
allele at the RBI locus on chromosome 13 is inactivated in
the germ line; the second event involves somatic inactivation
of the second allele. Since heritable cases require only a
single somatic mutation to initiate tumor formation, they
most commonly develop bilateral and multifocal tumors. In
the nonheritable cases, both alleles of the RBI gene must
acquire somatic inactivating mutations in a single retinal
precursor cell. Because of the low frequency of somatic
mutation, nonheritable RB is always unilateral and unifocal.
As initially predicted by Knudson (21) and later shown by
Cavenee et al. (4), all RB tumors have mutations in both
alleles of the RBI gene. In 70% of tumors, the second
mutation involves the somatic loss of the normal allele, often
by mitotic recombination and loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
in the RBI locus (4, 9).
A cDNA corresponding to the RBI locus has been cloned
and sequenced (2, 11, 12). The mRNA is ubiquitously
expressed, producing a 928-amino-acid, 105-kilodalton nuclear phosphoprotein, detectable in a variety of tissues (12,
24). Homozygous deletion of RBJ has been noted in several
RB tumors and in other tumor types (12, 13, 17, 18, 23, 24).
However, most RB tumors express a full-length RBI transcript and do not contain RBI gene rearrangements when
analyzed on Northern (RNA) and Southern blots (17). The
two-hit model of Knudson predicts that both RBI alleles in
these tumors must contain subtle mutations leading to functional inactivation of the RBI gene product. Previously, we
demonstrated that subtle mutations, detectable only by
RNase protection, were the predominant types of mutations
in RB tumors (10). To extend our characterization of the
mutations in RBI, we have used RNase protection of RBI
transcripts to locate probable mutations, followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify and sequence the
mutant allele.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell culture and nucleic acid isolation. RB tumor cell lines
(14, 15) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphocytes (34) were grown as described previously. Fresh surgical RB tumor specimens and cultured cells were lysed in
guanidine thiocyanate and layered on a CsCl gradient. The
RNA and DNA were isolated as described before (6, 17).
PCR oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems model 380A DNA synthesizer.

First-strand cDNA synthesis from total RNA, using specific
primers. Oligonucleotides JD1, JD3, and JD5 (0.5 pmol each)
were added to 10 to 20 ,ug of total RNA in 10 ,ul of 200 mM
NaCl-40 mM PIPES [piperazine-N,N'-bis(2-ethanesulfonic
acid)], pH 6.5-1 mM EDTA and heated to 70°C for 2 min,
followed by incubation at 42°C for 4 h. cDNA synthesis was
initiated by the addition of 40 ,ul of RTase buffer containing
60 mM Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.3, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM
KCl, 2.5 mM NaPPi, 2.5 mM dithiothreitol, a 0.5 mM
concentration of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 25 U of
RNAguard (Pharmacia), 20 U of avian myeloblastosis virus
(Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics), and 22 U of murine
(Pharmacia) reverse transcriptases. Reaction mixtures were
incubated at 40°C for 2 h and then frozen at -20°C until
needed.
Amplification of cDNA and genomic DNA, using the PCR.
Genomic DNA (1 ,ug) or cDNA (1/10 of first-strand synthesis) was denatured in 0.2 M NaOH for 5 min at room
temperature and then neutralized with HCl prior to amplification. PCR was performed as described before (28), using
three constant-temperature water baths and a robot arm to
move the samples between water baths. For amplifications
of s500 base pairs (bp), we used 80-s denaturation at 93°C,
100-s annealing at 56°C, and 60-s extension at 72°C. For
longer products, the extension times were increased. The
extension times were increased to 5 to 10 min on the last
cycle to ensure complete synthesis. Typically, 30 cycles
were sufficient for cloning and RNase protection experiments. The PCR reaction mixture was brought to 5 mM
EDTA and 300 mM NaOAc and extracted sequentially with
equal volumes of phenol and chloroform-isoamyl alcohol

(24:1). The mixture was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of
ethanol, pelleted by centrifugation, and suspended in TE (10
mM Tris hydrochloride, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) prior to
further manipulation.
Agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products. Typically,
1/10 of the PCR reaction was separated on 1.2% agarose gels
for products .800 bp in length or 1% agarose-2% NuSieve
composite gels for smaller products. Gels were electrophoresed, and the DNA was visualized as described previously (25).
RNase protection assay. Antisense RNA (cRNA) probes
were generated in vitro as described previously (10). In a
volume of 30 jil, 1/50 of the PCR reaction was hybridized to
105 cpm of labeled RNA probe. RNase digestion and electrophoresis were performed as described before (10).
Cloning of PCR products. The PCR products were ligated
into the EcoRV site of plasmid Bluescript SK (Stratagene)
and used to transform XL-1 Blue (Stratagene) Escherichia
coli. Colonies containing the insert were identified by their
inability to cleave the X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl,B-D-galactopyranoside) substrate.
DNA sequencing. Double-stranded plasmid templates containing the cloned PCR products were isolated as described
previously (26). Dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing reactions were performed on the plasmid DNA,
using a Sequenase kit (version 2.0) according to the specifications of the supplier (U.S. Biochemical Corp.).

analyzed by PCR, two were from patients with unilateral
disease and six were from four patients with bilateral RB
tumors. EBV-transformed lymphoblast cell lines from four
RB patients and the parents of three of the bilaterally
affected patients were also studied.
The Taq DNA polymerase requires a DNA template (28);
therefore, the RBI mRNA was first converted to cDNA by
reverse transcriptase. Three antisense oligonucleotides
(JD1, JD3, and JD5) (Fig. 1) were hybridized to total cellular
RNA to prime first-strand cDNA synthesis. Three separate
PCR reactions, each covering approximately one-third of the
coding region, were performed on the first-strand cDNA
(Fig. 1), and the PCR-cDNA products were analyzed by
agarose gel electrophoresis and the RNase protection assay.
Once the approximate location of the mutation was identified, the appropriate PCR-cDNA fragment was cloned and
sequenced. To determine whether or not the mutations

RESULTS
Detection of mutations. The RBI gene has 27 exons spanning approximately 180 kilobases of genomic DNA and
transcribes a 4.7-kilobase mRNA. To simplify the initial
screening of tumors, we focused our analysis on the coding
sequence in the RBI transcripts; most tumors (85%) express
detectable transcripts and are suitable for analysis with this
strategy. Mutations were identified in 13 of the 21 tumors
that were screened by RNase protection of RBI RNA
transcripts. Eight of these 13 RB tumors were studied in
greater detail, using PCR to isolate and sequence the mutant
portion of the genome (Table 1). Of the eight RB tumors

FIG. 2. Evidence that point mutation causes loss of exon 12 from RBJ mRNA in RB571 and RB600. First-strand cDNAs were amplified
and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis as described in Materials and Methods. (A) Ethidium-stained gel of PCR-cDNA amplified with
oligonucleotides JD3 and JD4 from constitutional cells of patient 571 (EBV571), RB571, and RB600. EcoRI- and HindIll-digested A DNA were
run as size markers. The length of the fragments is indicated on the left. A product of decreased length was detected in the RB571 and RB600
cDNAs. (B) Nucleotide sequences of wild-type and mutant RBI mRNA and genomic DNA at the intron boundaries of exon 12. The deletion
of exon 12 in RB571 and RB600 RNAs causes a translational frame shift and a termination codon in exon 13. The DNA mutation, a G-to-A
transition at the splice donor site of exon 12, is indicated with a wide arrow.

detected in the RNA were present in the DNA, the relevant
regions in genomic DNA from tumor cells and lymphoblasts
were amplified by PCR, using oligonucleotides flanking the
mutant region. The genomic sequence of RBJ was provided
by T. Dryja (25a). For yet unknown reasons, we have been
unable to amplify the sequences of exon 1 from either cDNA
or genomic DNA, and we were unable to characterize three
tumors with mutations in this region (10).
Identical somatic point mutations result in loss of exon 12
from two unrelated RB tumors. The unilateral and unifocal
tumors RB571 and RB600 were isolated from two unrelated
patients with no family history of RB. Analysis by agarose
gel electrophoresis of the PCR-cDNA products (primed with
JD3-4) of RB600, RB571, and EBV571 (an EBV-transformed
lymphoblast line from patient 571) showed an anomalous
band migrating at a lower molecular weight in both tumors
compared with the control (Fig. 2A). The PCR-cDNA products of RB571 and RB600 were cloned into plasmid vectors
and sequenced. All 10 cDNA clones isolated from both
tumors were missing exon 12, consistent with splice site
mutations. Loss of exon 12 introduced a frameshift into the
reading frame which could produce a truncated protein of
379 amino acids.
To identify the exact mutation responsible for the aberrant
splicing, we amplified and sequenced the genomic region
surrounding and including exon 12. Oligonucleotides corresponding to genomic sequences flanking exon 12 were used
in PCR amplification of the genomic DNA isolated from
RB571, RB600, and the constitutional cells (EBV571) of

patient 571. Constitutional cells from patient 600 were not
available. All 10 clones isolated from EBV571 contained the
normal sequence. Clones representative of each allele were
isolated from the RB571 tumor: two contained the normal
sequence and three contained a G-to-A transition at the
splice donor site of exon 12 (Fig. 2B). These results confirm
the restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis showing that RB571 retains both maternal and paternal alleles.
Using the sensitive PCR technique, we were unable to detect
any cDNAs which contained exon 12; apparently, the mutation on the other allele prevents synthesis of a detectable
transcript. The genomic PCR products from RB600 contained the same G-to-A transition in all 10 clones isolated,
suggesting that LOH was the second genetic event in this
tumor.
Identification of germ line mutations. RB tumors isolated
from patients with bilateral tumors must have one mutant
RBJ allele in the germ line. The four tumors from bilaterally
affected individuals without a family history of RB (RB429,
RB538, RB543, and RB570B) all demonstrate LOH (35), so
that the allele remaining in each tumor should carry the germ
line mutation. The constitutional cells from three of these
patients contained the mutation detected in the RB tumor;
constitutional cells of patient 429 or her parents were not
available. None of the parents of the other three patients
carried the mutated allele, confirming that these children
have new germ line mutations.

FIG. 3. Duplication of 55 bp of DNA in the constitutional cells (EBV538) and RB538 tumor from bilaterally affected patient 538. (A)
Ethidium-stained gel of PCR-cDNA amplified with oligonucleotides JD3 and JD4 from constitutional cells of patient 538 (EBV538) and RB538.
EcoRI- and HindIII-digested X DNA were run as size markers. The length of the fragments is indicated on the right. An anomalous fragment
of increased length in the RB538 lane is not detectable in EBV cells from the patient. (B) Ethidium-stained 3% NuSieve agarose composite
gel of PCR-amplified genomic DNA from the patient's constitutional cells, RB538, and his parents' lymphocytes. (C) Nucleotide sequence
of the region of exon 10 containing the 55-bp duplication in patient 538. The box indicates the 55 bp of DNA which is duplicated. The
duplication introduces a frameshift and termination TAA shown below.

exon 8. The absence of a normal sequence in this region
confirmed the LOH for this tumor (29). The deletion shifted
the reading frame and resulted in a new TGA termination
codon within exon 8. The predicted truncated protein would
contain 268 amino acids. The constitutional cells were not
available from this patient to confirm the 5-bp deletion as the
germ line mutation.
(ui) RB538. Figure 3A shows agarose gel electrophoresis of
the PCR-cDNA products of EBV538 and RB538, generated
by using the JD3 and JD4 primers. A band of increased
molecular weight is seen in the RB tumor. Southern blot
analysis and RNase protection of these PCR products indicated no mutant product in the lymphoblasts (data not
shown). Cloning and sequencing of the PCR-cDNA from the
tumor revealed a 55-bp duplication within exon 10. This
duplication altered the reading frame and introduced a novel
TAA termination codon at position 346 (Fig. 3C). According
to the two-hit model, the 55-bp duplication should be the
germ line mutation; however, no transcripts containing this
mutation were detected in the constitutional cells of the
patient. To resolve this discrepancy, oligonucleotides homologous to the intron sequences flanking exon 10 were used
for PCR amplification of genomic DNA from RB538, the
constitutional cells of patient 538 and his parents. Agarose
gel electrophoresis of the PCR-amplified products from
genomic DNA are shown in Fig. 3B. The two bands in the
constitutional cells of the patient indicate one allele with the
55-bp duplication and one normal allele; as expected, the RB
tumor contained only the 55-bp duplication. Since neither
parent carried this mutation, the 55-bp duplication must be a
new germ line mutation. It is noteworthy that no mutant

mRNA was detected in the lymphoblasts, while a mutant
mRNA was easily detectable in the RB tumor (see Discussion).
(iii) RB543. We previously localized a mutation in RB543
to exon 18 of the RBI gene (10). The tumor had undergone
LOH and contained only mutant transcripts. We were unable to detect the predicted germ line mutation in the RNA of
a patient's constitutional cells. Cloning and sequencing the
PCR-cDNA defined the mutation in RB543 as a 10-bp
deletion within exon 18. The deletion shifted the reading
frame and resulted in a TAA termination codon. The predicted truncated protein would contain 586 amino acids.
PCR amplification of genomic DNAs from constitutional
cells of patient 543 and her parents and from tumor RB543
were performed with oligonucleotides flanking the mutation.
RNase protection of these products detected the 10-bp
deletion on one allele of the patient's constitutional cells
(EBV543), confirming that it was the germ line mutation
(Fig. 4A). RB543 contained only the 10-bp deletion. Since
neither parent had the mutation, the 10-bp deletion must be
a new germ line mutation in their child.
(iv) RB570B. Patient 570 presented with advanced tumors
requiring enucleation of both eyes. Four separate tumors,
RB570A, -B, -C, and -D, were isolated from the two eyes.
Analysis of these four tumors with RFLP probes on chromosome 13 indicated that RB570A and -B (left eye) showed
LOH for markers within RBI. RB570C and -D (right eye)
remained heterozygous for all RFLPs tested (35). RNase
protection was performed on total RNA from tumors
RB570B, -C, and -D and EBV570 (data not shown). All
transcripts in RB570B contained a mutation in exon 19;

(B) RNase protection of PCR-amplified genomic DNAs performed as described in Materials and Methods. Antisense cRNA probe 18Ba was
used to protect the amplified products of the constitutional cells of patient RB543 and the lymphocytes of the parents. The sizes of protected
fragments are given on the left. (C) Nucleotide sequence of the region of exon 18 which contains the 10-bp deletion in RB543 and EBV543
cells. The deletion results in a translation frameshift and a TAA termination codon in exon 19.

transcripts from RB570D contained this mutation and an
apparently normal transcript; all RB570C transcripts contained a mutation in exon 22; and EBV570 contained only
normal transcripts. Since the mutation in exon 19 was
present in tumors isolated from different eyes, it was assumed to be in the germ line, even though transcripts with
this mutation were not observed in the patient's lymphoblasts or in RB570C (see below).
Oligonucleotide primers homologous to intron sequences
flanking exon 19 were used to amplify genomic DNA from
constitutional cells of patient 570 and her parents and from
tumors RB570B, -C, and -D. RNase protection of the PCR
products confirmed that a 9-bp deletion (see below) was the
germ line mutation carried by the patient and present in the
three tumors studied (Fig. SA). Both parents carried only
normal alleles, indicating that this patient had a new germ
line mutation. Since the 9-bp deletion in exon 19 led to the
formation of a novel, in-frame TAA termination codon,
translation of this message would result in a truncated
protein of 649 amino acids.
Somatic mutations in different tumors from a patient with
bilateral RB. All tumors arising in a patient with bilateral RB
should contain the same germ line mutation but should have
different somatic mutations, since each tumor arises independently. As shown above, the normal cells and all tumors
from patient 570 contain a 9-bp deletion in exon 19; clearly,
this is the predisposing germ line mutation. The second
somatic mutations in all four tumors are different, confirming
their independent origin. In tumors RB570A and -B, the

second somatic mutation was LOH on chromosome 13, in
RB570A by mitotic recombination between the RBI gene
and the most proximal informative RFLP (p7F12) and in
RB570B by LOH for all informative RFLPs (35). By using
primers JD1 and JD2, two different clones were isolated
from the PCR-amplified cDNA of RB57OD: one carried the
normal sequence, while the other contained the 9-bp deletion
within exon 19. The somatic mutation which initiated formation of RB570D has not yet been identified. Agarose gel
electrophoresis of the PCR-cDNAs generated with primers
JD1 and JD2 from the constitutional cells of patient 570 and
the three tumors RB570B, -C, and -D is shown in Fig. 6A.
The anomalous band of lower molecular weight was seen
only in sample RB570C, a tumor in which transcripts with
the 9-bp deletion were not detected. The location (defined by
RNase protection) and size of the mutant cDNA were
consistent with a deletion of exon 22 from the mature
mRNA. This observation was confirmed by cloning and
sequencing the PCR-cDNA product from RB570C. All
clones were missing exon 22. Since, using oligonucleotides
JD1 and JD2, the PCR-cDNA product contains both exon 19
and 22, it was clear that the allele transcribing the exon22-deleted message was not the allele which contained the
line 9-bp deletion. Oligonucleotides flanking exons 22
and 23 were used to amplify genomic DNA from EBV570
and RB570C. One allele of the tumor showed a singlebase-pair change: the AG of the splice acceptor site of exon
22 was changed to AA. The other allele from the tumor and
both alleles from the EBV cell line showed the normal AG.

FIG. 5. A 9-bp deletion in the germ line and three individual RB tumors isolated from a bilaterally affected patient. (A) Diagram of PCR
products, using oligonucleotides JD118+ and -119-. The position of the 9-bp deletion is indicated above, and the length of protected cRNA
probes is shown below. (B) RNase protection of PCR-amplified genomic DNAs performed as described in Materials and Methods. Antisense
cRNA probe 18Ba was used to protect the amplified products of the constitutional cells of the patient (EBV570), RB570B, -C, and -D and the
parents' lymphocytes. The sizes of protected fragments are given on the right. Since only three nucleotides remain beyond the deletion in
exon 19, the mutant transcript protects a smaller fragment 133 nucleotides in length. The reduced signal in RB570C was due to the limiting
amount of DNA available. (C) Nucleotide sequence of the region of exon 19 which contained the 9-bp deletion in RB570B, -C, -D, and
EBV570. The deletion resulted in the formation of an in-frame TAA termination codon at the site of the deletion.

Ligation of exon 21 to exon 23 leaves the mRNA in frame
and should result in a truncated RBI protein missing only the
38 amino acids encoded by exon 22.
DISCUSSION
Characterization of mutations in RBI. The Knudson twohit model (21) makes several clear predictions on the state of
the RBI alleles in RB patients and their tumors. The first
prediction is that all bilateral RB patients carry one mutated
and one normal allele in their constitutional cells. We have
detected mutations of one allele of RBI in the constitutional
cells from four bilaterally affected RB patients: EBV247
(shown previously [10]), EBV538, EBV543, and EBV570.
The second prediction is that a somatic mutation inactivates the remaining normal allele of the recessive RBJ gene
to initiate tumorigenesis. Earlier studies have shown that, in
70% of RB tumors, this second hit was loss of the normal
allele and duplication of the mutant allele (5), often by
mitotic recombination. Molecular demonstration of this
event is presented here for RB538, RB543, and RB57OB;
both alleles in these tumors carry the germ line mutation
detected on one allele of the EBV line. In the remaining 30%
of tumors, the somatic mutation has been assumed to be
different from the first mutation. The mutation in RB570C

validates this conclusion: in this tumor, one allele has the
line 9-bp deletion and a somatic point mutation present
in the other allele results in aberrant splicing and the loss of
exon 22.
The third prediction of the Knudson model is that the
multiple tumors arising in patients with bilateral RB will all
contain the same germ line mutation, but different somatic
mutations will inactivate the remaining normal allele. Patient
570 had four independent tumors. All tumors and the lymphocytes have a 9-bp deletion in exon 19. As described
above, the second somatic mutation was different in each
tumor (Table 1).
The fourth prediction is that most patients with unilateral
RB develop tumors from the occurrence of two somatic
mutations in a single retinoblast cell and will have two
normal alleles in their constitutional cells. We show that
RB571 and RB600, unilateral tumors, had the same point
mutation in the splice donor site of exon 12, resulting in a
mature mRNA lacking the entire exon 12. Since patient 600
was unavailable and one mutation in RB571 was undefined,
we were unable to demonstrate unequivocally the presence
of two independent somatic mutations in unilateral RB.
A splice donor mutation similar to that seen in RB571 and
-600, resulting in skipping an exon, has been documented in

thalassemia (31). However, in that instance, the majority of
the transcripts of the cloned mutant used a cryptic splice
donor 3' of the exon, resulting in a transcript of increased
length. Only a fraction of the transcripts were truncated by
skipping of the exon. In contrast, in RB571 and RB600, only
the truncated transcript missing exon 12 was detected. This
may be due to the absence of an adequate cryptic splice
donor in intron 12 or to instability of transcripts created from
a cryptic splice donor site.
Naturally occurring mutations which lead to disease states
have revealed much about the predisposing genes. Analysis
of the mutations in a low-density lipoprotein receptor gene in
familial hypercholesterolemia (3), oa- and P-globin genes in
thalassemia and sickle cell anemia (27), the gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase in phenylketonuria (8), and the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene in Lesch-Nyhan
syndrome (32) have delineated functional domains and suggested mechanisms of mutation. Analysis of mutations in
RBI has not yet provided such information (19, 22), although
Horowitz et al. did correlate loss of exon 21 in a bladder
carcinoma cell line with decreased stability of the RBI
protein and with loss of the ability to bind adenovirus ElA
protein.
RB tumors present a unique opportunity to study spontaneous germ line and somatic mutations in the same gene. It
is interesting that all four germ line mutations involve small

deletions

or

duplications. The three point mutations leading

to exon loss by aberrant splicing are all somatic mutations.

Deletions or duplications may be the result of double-strand
breaks followed by the DNA repair characteristically associated with meiotic recombination (30). Some diseases with
a high frequency of new germ line mutations, such as
Duchenne muscular dystrophy, also often involve deletions
and duplications (1, 20). Patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome have germ line mutations in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene; mutations can be small deletions, splice mutations (16), or point mutations (33).
Diseases with a low frequency of new germ line mutations,
such as the P thalassemias (27), are more often point
mutations than deletions.
Our failure to detect single-base-pair changes within the
coding region of the gene may be due to our selection by
RNase protection of tumors for analysis. Deletions and
insertions are the mutations most easily detectable by RNase
protection, while single-base changes may be undetectable
by the conditions we used for RNase protection. We are now
sequencing the coding region of the tumors which do not
show mutations by RNase protection; we expect to observe
single-base-pair mutations in these tumors.

affected RB patients, e.g., F462, EBV538, EBV543, and
EBV570; except for EBV247 (10), we did not detect transcripts from the mutant allele in lymphocytes. In the RB
tumors of these patients, the mutant mRNA was easily
detectable. It is difficult to explain these results without
postulating regulation of transcription of the RBI gene. Two
assumptions are required to construct a model which will fit
the available data. First, a functional RBI gene product must
directly or indirectly regulate its own transcription rate. In
support of this assumption, adenovirus-transformed human
retina cells express high levels of RBI transcripts (17); we
suggest that the binding of the RBI gene product by the Ela
protein of adenovirus prevents feedback regulation and leads
to increased transcription of the RBI gene in transformed
cells. Second, the RBI transcripts produced from the mutant
allele must be less stable than the normal transcript. The
instability of transcripts with premature termination codons
has been documented for other genes (7, 27).
We suggest that the following changes in transcription
occur in the cells of patients with a germ line mutation in one
RBI allele. In normal cells, i.e., lymphocytes, the transcription rate may increase twofold to compensate for the functional loss of RBI product from the mutant allele. If the
mutant transcript is unstable, its steady-state level will be
much less than that of the wild-type transcript, making the
mutant transcript undetectable in normal tissues. In RB
tumors, however, both alleles are mutant, and the complete
absence of functional RBI protein will result in maximal
transcription rates from both mutant alleles, allowing the
accumulation of detectable levels of unstable mutant
mRNAs in the tumor cells. This model can explain the
unexpected observations made on patients 538 and 543. The
germ line mutation in patients 538 (55-bp duplication) and
543 (10-bp deletion) produce premature termination of translation, probably leading to unstable transcripts which are
undetectable in lymphoblasts. However, the tumors in both
patients show LOH and contain only the mutant allele. The
absence of functional RBI protein results in very high rates
of transcription from the mutant alleles and accumulation of
levels of RBI transcripts which are easily detectable despite
their instability.
Patient 570 presents a unique opportunity to test the
assumptions of increased transcription of RBI in tumors and
instability of mutant RBI messages. As with the other
patients, the mutant allele (9-bp deletion) does not produce
detectable transcripts in lymphocytes. Three different tumors from this patient all show different patterns of RBI
transcripts. Tumor RB570B shows LOH and contains only
the allele with the germ line mutation; mutant transcripts are
easily detectable in this tumor. RB570D retains the mutant
germ line allele and has an uncharacterized mutation in the
remaining allele. Transcripts from both alleles are detectable
in this tumor at approximately the same level, indicating that
the somatic mutation in RB570D results in a transcript
whose stability is comparable to that containing the germ
line mutation. Tumor RB570C contains the germ line mutation on one allele and a somatic splice accepter mutation on
the other allele, leading to loss of exon 22 from the mature
mRNA. This tumor contains only transcripts with exon 22
deleted; we detected no transcripts with the 9-bp deletion.
We predict that the transcripts with the exon 22 deletion are
more stable than the ones with the 9-bp deletion because the
exon 22 deletion does not lead to premature termination.
Furthermore, we expect that the transcription rate of RBI in
RB570C will be less than in RB570B and -D.
It is perhaps significant that, of the four tumors isolated

4603

from patient 570, only RB570C has not grown in culture or in
the anterior chamber of a nude mouse eye (14). The cells,
which remain alive in culture, have formed Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes, indicative of differentiating retinoblast cells.
Perhaps the removal of the 38 amino acid residues from exon
22 only partially inactivates the protein, allowing it to carry
out some of its functions, and permits the tumor to undergo
some differentiation.
The importance of RBI in the developing retina is apparent from the observation that mutations in RBI prevent
normal differentiation and lead to uncontrolled growth of
retinal stem cells. A number of tumors from a variety of
tissues have been shown to contain mutated RBI alleles,
underlining the importance of RBI in regulating growth or
differentiation in many cell types. Given the general importance of RBI, it is likely that its expression requires precise
regulation. Our paper provides indirect, but convincing,
evidence in support of a model of transcriptional regulation
of RBI.
