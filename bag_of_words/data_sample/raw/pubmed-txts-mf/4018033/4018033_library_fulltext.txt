A ,B-globin gene cloned from a person with f-thalassemia
contained a T-*C substitution within the conserved sequence
AATAAA that forms a portion of the recognition signal for
endonucleolytic cleavage and polyadenylation of primary
mRNA transcripts. By Northern blot analysis a novel ,Bglobin RNA species, 1500 nucleotides in length, was detected
in erythroid RNA. Nuclease protection studies of erythroid
RNA, as well as RNA generated upon transient expression of
the cloned mutant gene in HeLa cells, located the 3' terminus
of this novel, polyadenylated RNA 900 nucleotides downstream of the normal poly(A) addition site, within 15 nucleotides of the first AATAAA in the 3' -flanking region of the 3globin gene. These findings define the in vivo terminus of an
elongated RNA and establish that human 3-globin transcription may extend at least 900 nucleotides 3' of the normal
polyadenylation site.
Key words: RNA processing/transcription termination/transient gene expression
Introduction
The majority of nonhistone mRNAs in higher eukaryotes are
polyadenylated at their 3' ends (Proudfoot, 1982). The highly
conserved sequence AAUAAA found 10-30 nucleotides
upstream of most polyadenylation sites in mRNA forms a
portion of a recognition signal for endonucleolytic cleavage
of primary transcripts (Fitzgerald and Shenk, 1981; Proudfoot, 1984). Recent evidence indicates that sequences located
immediately downstream of the poly(A) addition site also
contribute to the selection of cleavage sites (Simonsen and
Levinson, 1983; McDevitt et al., 1984; Woychik et al., 1984).
Polyadenylation of cleaved RNAs may involve small nuclear
ribonucleoprotein particles, perhaps of the U4 snRNP class
(Moore and Sharp, 1984; Berget, 1984).
When the DNA sequence corresponding to the AAUAAA
signal, AATAAA is altered to AAGAAA or AATAAG in
adenovirus (Montell et al., 1983) and human rt-globin genes
(Higgs et al., 1983), respectively, elongated RNA transcripts
have been observed. These findings are consistent with
transcription and subsequent polyadenylation at positions
beyond the normal polyadenylation site. The manner in
which transcription terminates 3' to eukaryotic genes is
uncertain. Although transcription proceeds downstream
from the mouse fl-globin and other genes (Nevins and
Darnell, 1978; Nevins et al., 1980; Hofer and Darnell, 1981;
Hofer et al., 1982; Salditt-Georgieff and Darnell, 1983,

1984), discrete termination sites have yet to be defined.
Rather transcription appears to diminish over a stretch of
DNA >500 bp downstream from the poly(A) addition site
(Hofer and Darnell, 1981; Salditt-Georgieff and Darnell,
1983, 1984; Rohrbaug et al., 1984).
Here we describe a human f-globin gene isolated from a
patient with ,B-thalassemia in which a T--C substitution
within the AATAAA sequence was observed. In stable
erythroid RNA we observed ,B-globin RNA which was
polyadenylated 900 bp downstream from the normal position
and just beyond the first AAUAAA in the flanking sequence.
These data locate the in vivo 3' terminus of an elongated
RNA and demonstrate that a fraction of primary ,B-RNA
transcripts may extend at least 900 bp 3' of the normal
polyadenylation site.
Results
Identification of a novel 3-thalassemia gene
As part of a comprehensive study of f3-thalassemia in black
Americans (Antonarakis et al., 1984) we identified a family in
which an abnormally large 3-globin RNA ( - 1500 nucleotides
in length) was present in Northern blot analysis of erythroid
RNA (Figure 1). Three family members had this novel RNA
species in association with a /-thalassemia gene within a
chromosome of polymorphism haplotype 2 (Antonarakis et
al., 1984; Orkin and Kazazian, 1984). Approximately 25% of
,-thalassemia genes among black Americans are found in this
haplotype (Antonarakis et al., 1984). In individuals
heterozygous for both the sickle f-globin gene ((s) and the (3thalassemia gene described here, Hb A was 22-24%, Hb S

Fig. 2. SI nuclease mapping of normal and mutant RNA transcripts. SI
nuclease mapping probes were 3' end-labeled at the indicated restriction
sites below the map of the ,B-gene and its downstream region. Probes used:
left panel, 2.0-kb EcoRI*-BglII fragment. Center, mixed probe consisting
of 1.1-kb AccI*-EcoRI and 1.34-kb AccI*-BglII. Right, 0.23-kb PstI-HphI.
The asterisk denotes the site of the 3' end label. Lanes: 1 = RNA
prepared from HeLa cells transfected with the normal ,B-globin gene. 2 =
RNA prepared from HeLa cells transfected with the mutant gene. 3,5,10
= erythroid RNA from patients with novel elongated ,B-RNA. 4,8,9 =
normal bone marrow RNA. 7 = no RNA added control. 6 = 3' endlabeled PstI*-HphI SI probe digested with AvaIl. M = pBR322 DNA
digested with HinfI. The sizes of the markers are provided only for the left
panel. The lowest band in the other marker lanes is 75 nucleotides. Comparison of lanes 6 and 10 demonstrates that the 3' end of the elongated
RNA is located - 3-5 nucleotides upstream of the 3'-flanking A vaIlI site.
The various fragments protected in normal and mutant RNA samples are
shown schematically below. The open arrow in the left panel, the closed
arrow in the center, and the asterisk in the right denote the 1. 1-kb, 0.45-kb
and 0. 1-kb fragments, respectively, that permitted accurate mapping of the
3' end of the elongated RNA transcript. The 0.12-kb protected fragment in
lane 2 derived from alternative splicing into the 3'-untranslated region was
routinely seen in RNA samples of HeLa cells transfected with the mutant
gene. Although some protected fragment at the same position is evident in
lane 3, it was not seen reproducibly and appears to represent minor nicked
input probe (as exemplified by other minor bands seen in lanes 1 and 3).
Use of an additional SI probe EcoRI*-PstI, which spans the
3'-untranslated region and the initial 3'-flanking segment of the gene, led
to protection of the 0.12-kb fragment in HeLa RNAs from cells transfected
with the mutant gene, but not from in vivo erythroid RNA (not shown).

10 g/100 ml. These patients have a clinical course similar
to that of other black Americans with S-f-thalassemia.
A mutation (T--C) lies within the cleavage-polyadenylation
signal (AA TAAA)
The ,B-thalassemia gene was cloned (Orkin et al., 1982) from
an individual with sickle-fi-thalassemia, subjected to DNA sequence analysis (Maxam and Gilbert, 1980), and expressed
transiently in HeLa cells (Treisman et al., 1982, 1983). Within

RNA cleavage occurs 900 nucleotides downstream
Upon transient expression in cultured HeLa cells this gene
directed about one-fifth to one-tenth as much stable f-RNA
as a normal fl-gene (Figure 2, lanes 1 and 2). SI nuclease mapping of RNAs generated in the transient expression assay and
of in vivo erythroid RNA was performed. Using an endlabeled probe extending from the exon-3 EcoRI site 2 kb in
the 3' direction, we detected three protected fragments (1.1,
0.2, and 0.12 kb) upon hybridization with RNA from HeLa
cells transfected with the mutant gene (Figure 2, lane 2) and
two prominent fragments (1.1 and 0.2 kb) with in vivo RNA
(Figure 2, lane 3). Fractionation of RNA samples on
oligo(dT)-cellulose demonstrated protection only with the
poly(A) + fraction (not shown). In addition to the normal
protected fragment of 0.2 kb (lane 1), therefore, a novel
1.1-kb nucleotide species was evident in both HeLa and in
vivo RNAs (lanes 2 and 3). This species, which was absent in
normal blood and marrow RNA samples, could be generated
either by an RNA cleavage or splicing event -900 bp
downstream from the ,(-globin gene. The 0.12-kb protected
fragment, seen clearly and reproducibly only in HeLa cells
transfected with the mutant gene (lane 2), apparently arises
from a splicing event within the 3'-untranslated region at a
cryptic donor-like sequence (AAGGTTCCT, nucleotides
34-42 of the untranslated region).
To delineate the nature of the RNA leading to the novel
1.1-kb protected fragment, additional SI nuclease mapping
of the in vivo RNA was performed with various probes
(Figure 2, lanes 4- 10). Protected fragments were consistent
only with either an RNA cleavage or splicing event 900 bp
downstream from the normal polyadenylation site. Given the
size of normal ,B-globin RNA ( -600 nucleotides), the extent
of the 3' extension (900 nucleotides), and the size of the novel
RNA detected by Northern blot analysis (1500 nucleotides),
we conclude that this position marks the 3' terminus of the
RNA. Using SI nuclease probes located further downstream
(up to 1.8 kb), no protected fragments were observed upon
hybridization to erythroid RNA of one of the patients (not
shown). Due to the low abundance of f-globin RNA in HeLa
cells transfected with the mutant gene, we have not been successful in defining the acceptor sequence spliced to the donorlike sequence in the 3'-untranslated region during transient
expression.

The SI nuclease mapping experiments indicate that the site
of RNA cleavage and polyadenylation downstream from the
mutant gene lies within five nucleotides 5' to an AvaII site
[GG(A or T)CC] (Figure 2, lanes 6 and 10) situated 900
nucleotides downstream of the normal poly(A) addition site.
The DNA sequence of this region is AATAAAATAT
GAGTCTCAAG TGGTCCTTGT (Poncz et al., 1983). We
infer from these findings that cleavage and subsequent
polyadenylation occurred within 10-15 nucleotides
downstream of the underlined AATAAA sequence, the first
encountered in the 3'-flanking region (Poncz et al., 1983).
The patterns of RNA cleavage and polyadenylation deduced
from the nuclease protection studies are depicted in Figure 3.

Fig. 3. Schematic representation of the RNAs detected by SI nuclease
mapping. The mutant gene contained the T-C substitution indicated in
the 3'-untranslated region of the ,B-globin gene. In vivo erythroid RNA contained a species with an additional 900 nucleotides at the 3' end. This
RNA was polyadenylated and had its 3' terminus just beyond the first
AATAAA in the downstream sequence. In HeLa cells transfected with the
mutant gene this novel RNA was found at a low level in addition to a
small amount of normally cleaved and polyadenylated RNA and another
species in which splicing occurred at a cryptic donor sequence within the
untranslated region (bottom pattern). The downstream acceptor was not
identified. Transcripts from the mutant gene within erythroid cells may
have contained some normally cleaved and polyadenylated RNA but this
could not be assessed due to the presence of a OS-gene in trans in the patient.

Discussion
The formation of 3' ends of eukaryotic polymerase

II-

generated mRNAs involves endonucleolytic cleavage and
polyadenylation (Montell et al., 1983; Proudfoot, 1984).
What role, if any, specific transcription termination signals
play in this process is uncertain. Considerable previous work
has demonstrated that the transcriptional unit of polymerase
II-transcribed genes may extend considerably past the poly(A)
addition site, perhaps as far as 1000 -2500 nucleotides
(Hofer and Darnell, 1981; Salditt-Georgieff and Darnell,
1983, 1984; Rohrbaug et al., 1984). Specifically, data on the
(mai and rabbit (1 genes indicates that high level
transcription may proceed for -600 nucleotides beyond the
poly(A) site (Salditt-Georgieff and Darnell, 1983; Rohrbaug
et al., 1984). Further downstream transcription appears to
decrease over a region of -1000 additional nucleotides. It
has recently been suggested that an inverted repeat located
600 nucleotides beyond the poly(A) addition site of the rabbit (1 gene may be involved in this attenuation of transcription (Rohrbaug et al., 1984). The sequences of the
3'-flanking regions of the human
and rabbit (1-globin
genes share considerable homology in this region (Rohrbaug
mouse

(-

et al., 1984).

Our results with the (-thalassemia gene carrying a naturally
occurring mutation (AATAAA--AACAAA) within the polyadenylation-cleavage signal support and extend these general
findings. First, we infer from the transient expression of this
gene that cleavage and polyadenylation at the normal poly(A)
addition site is markedly inefficient but not totally extinguished (Figure 2, lane 2) due to the single base substitution within
the conserved sequence AATAAA. A T- G substitution in
the same position of an adenovirus gene (Montell et al., 1983)
had a similar effect on the efficiency of formation of wildtype 3' ends. Second, our findings demonstrate that
transcription may proceed at least 900 nucleotides beyond the
poly(A) addition site of the human (3-globin gene when normal cleavage and polyadenylation is largely prevented
(Figures 2 and 3). Since the level of the extended (-mRNA

from the mutant allele in erythroid cells is lower than that of
mature ,B-mRNA from the Os allele (Figure 1), we cannot
estimate the actual efficiency of transcription through the 900
nucleotide segment downstream from the normal poly(A) addition site. Several additional factors may contribute to a
reduced level of this species. For one, some extended mRNAs
may be processed aberrantly using the cryptic donor site
detected in the transient expression assay (Figure 2, lane 2 and
Figure 3). In addition, the cleavage-polyadenylation signal
that is utilized 900 nucleotides downstream may function inefficiently and lead to the further loss of transcripts, especially since recent evidence favors the role of sequences 3' to the
poly(A) addition site in determining the efficiency with which
an AATAAA sequence is utilized (Simonsen and Levinson,
1983; McDevitt et al., 1984; Woychik et al., 1984). Although
we cannot accurately assess the contributions of these various
factors, we can confidently conclude that transcription may
proceed at least a fraction of the time through the 900
nucleotides 3' to the f-globin gene and that no absolute
transcription termination signals appear to exist in this vicinity. Third, our results establish the in vivo 3' terminus of an
extended mRNA just beyond the first AATAAA sequence
downstream from the (-gene. In a previously reported instance of a-thalassemia in which AATAAA was altered to
AATAAG, elongated transcripts were seen in transient assays
but not in vivo. We surmise that the extended f3-mRNA is
more stable within erythroid cells than the extended cmRNA. In part this may relate to the proximity of the 'cryptic' cleavage-polyadenylation signals to the respective normal
poly(A) addition sites of these genes. In the study of the athalassemia gene, transient assay was performed using a construct with a short downstream segment (Higgs et al., 1983).
Therefore, the potential site(s) of cleavage and poly(A) addition could not be assessed.
The 'cryptic' polyadenylation signal 900 bp downstream
from the 3-globin gene appears, in this instance, to be the
predominant site utilized in generation of stable erythroid cell
transcripts. RNAs from erythroid and transfected HeLa cells
did not protect DNA probes situated further downstream
(not shown). Either few transcripts escape cleavage and
polyadenylation at this AATAAA signal or those that do cannot be appropriately cleaved at the numerous AATAAA sequences (Poncz et al., 1983) located in the ensuing 1000
nucleotides.
The phenotype of individuals carrying this ,B-thalassemia
gene is somewhat milder than anticipated from the above
results and the findings of others. Specifically, -20- 25Wo of
the total hemoglobin is normal (HbA, cat-) in individuals
heterozygous for both ,B-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia.
In view of the inefficient cleavage and polyadenylation at the
normal poly(A) addition site upon transient expression of the
mutant gene in HeLa cells (Figure 2, lane 2), less normal
hemoglobin might be anticipated. As no homozygotes for this
mutation have been identified, the percent of transcripts actually cleaved and polyadenylated at the normal position in
vivo is unknown. It is possible that cleavage and polyadenylation at the normal position within erythroid cells may exceed
that evident in the HeLa cell transient expression assay.
Whether the 1500 nucleotide ,8-RNA seen in the patients is
translated has not been assessed. However, the appreciable
level of HbA in individuals heterozygous for this form of (thalassemia and sickle cell anemia suggests that it is likely to

contribute substantially to globin production.

Materials and methods
Haplotype analysis, gene cloning and DNA sequencing
Determination of DNA polymorphisms within the f3-globin gene cluster in the
propositus and family members was performed as described previously (Orkin
et al., 1982; Antonarakis et al., 1984; Orkin and Kazazian, 1984). In this family the chromosomes bearing the normal (1A), sickle (J3s) and thalassemic
globin genes could be distinguished by their patterns of polymorphic restriction sites (haplotypes). The ,B-thalassemia gene was present on a chromosome
of haplotype 2 in blacks as defined in Orkin and Kazazian (1984) and
Antonarakis et al. (1984). The ,B-thalassemia gene of an individual
heterozygous for both ,B-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia was cloned as a
7.5-kb HindlII fragment in bacteriophage Charon 28 as described (Orkin et
al., 1982).
Transient gene expression and SI nuclease mapping
The mutant ,B-globin gene was subcloned as a 5.2-kb BglII fragment in the expression vector 7rSVplac (Triesman et al., 1983) and introduced into HeLa
cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. This construct contains -2 kb of
downstream flanking sequences. The normal ,B-globin gene was introduced
into HeLa cells as a 3.7-kb BgllI/PstI fragment in this vector as before
(Treisman et al. 1983). 48 h after transfection, HeLa cells were harvested and
total cellular RNA was isolated (Antonarakis et al., 1984). SI nuclease mapping probes were prepared as described (Favaloro et al., 1980), labeled singly at
either the 5' or 3' end (Maxam and Gilbert, 1980). 3'-Flanking restriction
sites were derived from the sequence reported by Poncz et al. (1983). Probes

hybridized to RNAs as described (Favaloro et al., 1980) and then
digested with S1 nuclease (Sigma) at 1000 units/ml for 45 min at 37°C. Protected DNA fragments were electrophoresed in urea-acrylamide gels (Maxam
and Gilbert, 1980).
Northern blot analysis
Peripheral blood RNA samples were prepared as described previously (Anwere

tonarakis et al., 1984), formaldehyde-treated, electrophoresed and then
transferred to nitrocellulose (Maniatis et al., 1982). The filter was hybridized
with a 0.9-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment of the /3-globin
