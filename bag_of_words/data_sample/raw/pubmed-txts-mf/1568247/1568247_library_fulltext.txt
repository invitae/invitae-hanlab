Summary
The neurofibromatosis
1 (EIF 7) gene product, neurofibromin, contains a GTPase-activating
protein (GAP)related domain, or NFl GRD, that is able to downregulate ~21’“~ by stimulating
its intrinsic
GTPase.
Since p21m.GTP is a major regulator
of growth and
differentiation,
mutant neurofibromins
resulting from
somatic mutations in the NF1 gene might interfere with
ras signaling pathways and contribute to the development of tumors. We describe an amino acid substitution in the NFl GRD, altering Lys-1423, that has occurred in three tumor types: colon adenocarcinoma,
myelodysplastic
syndrome,
and anaplastic
astrocytome, and in one family with neurofibromatosis
1. The
GAP activity of the mutant NFl GRD is 200- to 400-fold
lower than that of wild type, whereas binding affinity
is unaffected.
Thus, germline mutations in NF7 that
cause neuroflbromatosis
1 can also occur in somatic
cells and contribute
to the development
of sporadic
tumors, including tumors not associated with neurofibromatosis
1.
Introduction
Guanine nucleotide binding to ras proteins mediates signal transduction that regulates cell growth: binding to GTP
activates signaling, while hydrolysis to GDP terminates
signaling (Barbacid, 1987). A GTPase-activating
protein
(GAP) was the first protein found to catalyze the hydrolysis
to GDP and thereby mediate the signal termination event
(Trahey and McCormick, 1987). In addition to this role, it

has been proposed that GAP may alS0 fUnCtiOn in Signal
propagation as a downstream effector of ras (McCormick,
1989; Hall, 1990). More recently, the GAP-related domain
(GRD) of neurofibromin,
the neurofibromatosis
1 (AW)
gene product, was also found to stimulate the GTPase of
ras (Ballester et al., 1990; Martin et al., 1990; Xu et al.,
1990b) and to possess properties consistent with the functioning
of neurofibromin
as a downstream effector of ras
(Bollag and McCormick, 1991).
Since somatic mutations that activate fas genes may
contribute to tumorigenesis in up to 30% of human tumors
(Bos, 1989), we reasoned that somatic mutations in the
NFl gene that affect the ras signaling pathway may also
occur in some of these tumor types, as well as in tumors
associated with neurofibromatosis
1. Therefore, we chose
to search sporadic tumors from non-NFl individuals as
well as the constitutional DNA of NFl patients for mutations in the NFl GRD. Here we describe mutations found
in tumors and in a family with neurofibromatosis
1.
Results
Detection of Mutations in the NFl GRD
in Tumors
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) single-stranded
conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method (Orita et al.,
1989) was used to screen rapidly for mutations in the GRD
of the NF7 gene (NFl GRD) in samples of DNA extracted
from tumors. The first exon screened is 159 bp in length
and corresponds to codons 1371-l 423 of the open reading frame of the full-length NF7 cDNA (Marchuk et al.,
1991). Located in the middle of the NFl GRD, the protein
segment encoded by this exon shows approximately 30%
homology to the corresponding
segments of the human
GAP and yeast IRA1 and IRA2 proteins (Xu et al., 1990a).
A stretch of three consecutive amino acids, FLR, near the
middle of the exon is completely conserved across all four
proteins; FLR occurs only once in the entire 2818 aa sequence of the predicted NFl protein. For convenience, we
refer to this exon as the FLR exon.
This exon received high priority in our screening strategy, because the relatively high degree of conservation of
amino acid sequence across these different proteins and
between species suggested that somatic mutations in this
region of the gene would be likely to alter amino acid residues crucial to the function of the protein, and so result in
clinical pathology.
A pair of intron-based primers (see Experimental Procedures) was used to generate a 236 bp PCR product containing the FLR exon. In most cases, paired samples of
tumor DNA and accompanying
constitutional DNA from
the same individuals were analyzed. The DNA samples
were from 22 colon adenocarcinomas
paired with either
peripheral blood lymphocytes or normal colon tissue; 28
peripheral blood samples from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (a preleukemia condition) for which no
constitutional DNA was available; and 10 anaplastic astro-

cytoma/peripheral
blood lymphocyte pairs. (Astrocytoma
is one of the most common malignant brain tumors.) No
tumor samples were from NFl patients.
One of each tumor type showed a variant band on SSCP
gels. Figure 1 shows the SSCP patterns for the tumor and
constitutional DNA from the one remarkable colon cancer
sample and the one remarkable anaplastic astrocytoma
sample. DNA sequencing (Figure 1) showed that both variant bands were due to a single base change affecting the
first nucleotide position of the Lys codon (AAG) at position
1423 in the amino acid sequence. This Lys is one of 14
aa residues in the catalytic domain that are absolutely
conserved across all members of the GAP family of proteins (proteins encoded in yeast by the IRAI, IRA2, and
Sad genes and in mammals by the GAP and NF7 genes)
(Xu et al., 1990a; Wang et al., 1991), suggesting that it has
a crucial function in NFl GRD activity. An A to G transition
in the colon cancer causes a Lys to Glu amino acid substitution. However, an A to C transversion in the anaplastic
astrocytoma results in a Lys to Gln amino acid substitution.
All SSCP bands derived from the constitutional DNA samples accompanying
these two tumors were also sequenced, revealing only the normal AAG codon. The sequences of the tumor variant bands and the constitutional
DNA bands were otherwise identical. Normal tissue DNA

therefore, it was not possible to show that the variant seen
reflects a somatic mutation arising in the tumor tissue.
However, sequencing of the variant band from this myelodysplastic syndrome sample revealed the same GAG variant codon shown above to have occurred as a somatic
mutation in the colon cancer sample.
Detection of the Lys to Glu Mutation in a Patient
with Neuroflbromatosis
1
To detect sensitively and rapidly any change in the first
nucleotide of the Lys-1423 codon in the constitutional DNA
of NFl patients, we designed a restriction enzyme digestion-based assay that uses PCR to introduce the recognition sequence of the enzyme in an allele-specific manner
(Pettyetal., 1991). Inthisassaythepresenceofthenormal
adenine nucleotide at the first base of the codon allows
cutting, but the appearance of any other nucleotide destroys the recognition site of the restriction enzyme. A PCR
primer based on the sequence immediately preceding the
AAG lysine codon was used in combination with a downstream intron-based primer to amplify a short DNA segment containing the AAG lysine codon (see Experimental
Procedures). By designing the upstream primer to have a
nontemplate G nucleotide at its 3’terminus, we cause the
PCR product derived from normal NFl sequence to contain the sequence TCGA, in which the G comes from the
last base in the upstream primer and the A comes from the
first nucleotide position of the AAG lysine codon. Since
TCGA is the recognition site for Taql restriction endonuclease, the PCR product from the normal NFl sequence will
be cut by Taql. Any mutation altering the first A in the AAG
Lys-1423 codon prevents cutting by Taql.
Lymphoblast DNA samples from 80 NFl patients were
screened by this assay, along with the mutant anaplastic
astrocytoma sample and its accompanying
normal lymphocyte DNA. The PCR products from 79 of the 80 NFl
patients and from the lymphocyte DNA of the anaplastic
astrocytoma patient cut completely with Taql, whereas
approximately one-half of the PCR product from the anaplastic astrocytoma DNA sample did not cut with the restriction enzyme, as expected from our sequencing data
for this tumor DNA sample. However, NFl patient 11404
appeared to be heterozygous at the first nucleotide position of the AAG codon, since only half of the PCR product
showed cutting with Taql (Figure 2, sample 1).
To determine what sequence change was responsible
for this result, the entire FLR exon was PCR amplified
from the genomic DNA of patient 11404, cloned into the
pBluescript II phagemid vector, and sequenced manually.
Sequencing of ten independent clones revealed that five
contained the normal Lys-1423 codon, AAG; however, the
remaining five clones contained the unusual codon Glu1423 GAG that had been found in the colon cancer DNA
sample.

tion at codon 1423 is the cau8e of neurofibromatosis
1
in patient 11404, we tested DNA samples from several
NFl-affected
and unaffected family members of this patient, using the Taql restriction digestion-based
assay
(Figure 2). All NFl-affected descendants of patient 11404,
like patient 11404 herself, were heterozygous
by this
assay. The one unaffected granddaughter
was homozygous for the normal A nucleotide. The three NFl-affected
granddaughters
had to inherit the Taql-resistant
allele
from their NFl-affected father, because their unaffected
mother is homozygous for the Taql-sensitive allele. This
study shows that the Glu-1423 mutation perfectly coinherits with neurofibromatosis
1 in this family and therefore
must lie in the same copy of the NFl gene that bears the
neurofibromatosis-causing
mutation. This is the expected
result if the Glu-1423 mutation itself is the cause of neurofibromatosis 1 in this family.
Construction,
Expression,
and Biochemical
Analysis of NFl GRD Mutant Proteins
To examine the functional consequences of these mutations, site-directed mutagenesis by PCR was performed
to generate the A to C and A to G mutant fragments of NFl
cDNA encoding the GAP-related domain (NFl GRD). DNA
sequencing confirmed that only the desired bases were
mutated. Mutant NFl fragments with an appended sequence encoding the KT3 epitope (TPPPEPET)
were
cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcC4, and
the two mutant NFl GRD proteins were expressed in Sf9
insect cells and purified using KT3 beads as previously
described (Martin et al., 1990).
The ras GTPase-stimulating
activities of the mutant and
wild-type NFl GRDs were determined by measuring phosphate release (Martin et al., 1990). Figure 3 shows that
the activities of both mutant proteins are greatly reduced
compared with that of wild-type NFl GRD. The activities
of the Lys to Gln and Lys to Glu mutants were reduced by
approximately 400- and 200-fold, respectively. ~21 N-ra8was

bind with about the same affinity. The affinity of ras.GDP
for both mutant and wild-type NFl GRD was approximately
lOO-fold lower than the affinity for ras.GTP (data not

Somatically acquired point mutations affecting codon
14230f the NFl gene have been found in DNAfrom acolon
adenocarcinoma
and an anaplastic astrocytoma. One of
these mutations was also detected in a myelodysplasia for
which no constitutional
DNA control was available. The
mutations alter a Lys residue in the catalytic domain of
neurofibromin
that is invariant among GAP-related proteins (Xu et al., 1990a; Wang et al., 1991) and is therefore
likely to be crucial for normal functioning. Indeed, the mutant NFl GRD proteins bind with normal affinity to
ras.GTP but are severely impaired in stimulating the ras
GTPase. Somatic mutations in tumors were not randomly
distributed within the NF1 gene: within this 159 bp exon,
screened in 60 tumors, mutations were detected only in
codon 1423. A mutation in this same codon was also found
in a family with NFl, where it coinherits with the disease.
These results suggest that at least some of the mutations
in the NF7 gene that occur in the germline to cause neurofibromatosis 1 can also occur in somatic cells and contribute
to the development of sporadic tumors.
One might expect that any tumor type found occasionally to harbor somatic mutations in the NFI gene would
be a tumor type with an increased incidence among NFl
patients. Indeed, astrocytomas have been reported to occur at higher rates in NFl patients (Blatt et al., 1966;
Serensen et al., 1966; Cohen and Rothner, 1969; Kibirige
et al., 1969). However, colon cancers and myelodysplasias do not seem to have an increased incidence among
NFl patients. Furthermore,
three generations of NFlaffected individuals in the family of patient 11404 had no
history of either of these tumor types, even though the
Glu-1423 mutation found in the colon and myelodysplasia
tumors must be present in every somatic cell of these
individuals.
There is a precedent for this apparent paradox among
the hereditary neoplastic syndromes. Somatic mutations
in the retinoblastoma
gene are found frequently in sporadic small cell lung cancers, yet this tumor type does
not have an increased incidence among individuals with
hereditary retinoblastoma (Harbour et al., 1966; Yokota et
al., 1968). Thus, somatic mutations in the Rb gene in lung
cells may contribute to, and may even be necessary for,
the development of the tumors; however, the mutations
are not rate limiting for tumorigenesis
in this cell type.
These considerations suggest that NF7 mutations might
promote growth in NFl-associated
tumor types by one
mechanism and promote growth in other tumor types by
a somewhat different mechanism. Possible roles for neurofibromin as either an upstream regulator or a downstream effector of ras.GTP have been presented (Xu et
al., 1990a), but these roles are not incompatible: neurofibromin may serve both functions. In cell types where
ras.GTP is growth promoting, e.g., in colon cancers (80s
et al., 1987) and myelodysplasias (Liu et al., 1987; Lyons
et al., 1988; Padua et al., 1988), the diminished capacity
of mutant neurofibromins
to stimulate GTP hydrolysis on
ras may allow enhanced
ras.GTP signaling, causing
growth. In cell types where ras.GTP appears to be growth

inhibiting, e.g., in Schwann cells (Ridley et al., 1988) and
pheochromocytomas
(Bar-Sagi and Feramisco, 1985;
Noda et al., 1985) mutant neurofibromin
may disrupt a
ras.GTP-neurofibromin
complex that is required for transduction of the growth-inhibiting
signal. This would then
shift the balance of growth-regulating
signals toward
growth. The latter mechanism may be involved in neurofibromatosis 1, since Schwann cells proliferate excessively in
the development of neurofibromas (Riccardi and Eichner,
1986) and pheochromocytomas
have an increased incidence among NFl patients (Riccardi and Eichner, 1986;
Cohen and Rothner, 1989). Furthermore, a careful screen
for activating mutations in ras genes in human pheochromocytomas revealed none (Moley et al., 1991)-the expected
result if ras.GTP inhibits growth in this cell type.
According to the above scheme the Glu-1423 NF7 mutation would be expected to disrupt both of the proposed
functions of neurofibromin (ras regulator and ras effector)
in order to contribute to the development of colon and
myelodysplasia tumors and cause neurofibromatosis
1;
i.e., the mutant neurofibromin should be functionally null.
In addition to its diminished ability to stimulate the ras
GTPase, demonstrated here, it should be blocked in signal
transduction. Alternatively, the levels of the mutant neurofibromin in the cell could be very low if the mutation makes
the protein unstable. Many of the NF7 mutations that have
already been found in NFl patients are also expected to
be nulls, because they involve translocations,
mediumsized to large deletions, or stop codons occurring within
protein-coding regions of the gene (Viskochil et al., 1990;
Cawthon et al., 1990). The view presented here of neurofibromin as both ras regulator and ras effector would allow
the protein to function somewhat differently in different
tissues. Thus, overlapping but distinct classes of mutant
NFl alleles may yet prove to be involved in the development of different tumor types.
How broad a role do somatic mutations at the NF7 locus
play in tumorigenesis? Three out of sixty tumors revealed
functionally important missense mutations affecting a single normally invariant residue of the highly conserved FLR
exon. However, it is difficult to estimate the overall frequency of involvement of NF 7 in such tumors, as the mutations reported here were detected in the first NF1 exon
screened, leaving 49 protein-encoding
exons yet to be
scanned. Therefore, the true incidence of somatic mutations in the NFI gene in colon adenocarcinomas,
myelodysplasias, and anaplastic astrocytomas may be quite
high.
In light of the mutations reported here, a possible role
for NF7 mutations should be considered in any tumor type
in which activatedrasgenesarefrequentlyfound.
Perhaps
in these tumortypes NF7 mutations are the functional complement of ras mutations and will be found in those tumor
samples lacking ras mutations. Since in neurofibromatosis
1 tumor incidence
is elevated in at least some tissues
where ras.GTP is growth inhibiting (see above), a role for
NF7 mutations must also be considered in any tumor type
in which activated ras can be shown to inhibit growth (e.g.,
medullary thyroid carcinoma; Nakagawa et al., 1987; Nelkin et al., 1990). Perhaps in these tumor types NF7 muta-

In this assay when genomic DNA is used as the template for PCR with
the FLRTAQ and rFLRlN primers, amplification
occurs from both the
NF 1 locus on chromosome
17 and the NFI pseudogene
locus on chromosome 15 (Y. L. et al., unpublished
data); this happens because the
nucleotide
sequence
identity in these two homologous
segments
is
greater than 90%, and neither of the primers used for PCR in this
amplification
is locus specific. To make the assay specific to the NF1
locus on chromosome
17, we first amplify the entire FLR exon with the
intron-based
primers FLRIN and rFLRlN (as above, but without the
radioactive
nucleotide).
This PCR amplifies only from the NFI locus
on chromosome
17 (unpublished
data), because FLRIN cannot prime
in the pseudogene.
We then dilute this NFI locus-specific
PCR product IOOO-fold and perform a second PCR using the FLRTAQ
and
rFLRlN primers to obtain the final product that is tested in the Taql

transferred
to a second microtiter plate, under a drop of mineral oil.
Eight units of Taql restriction endonuclease
in a 4 ul volume was then
added to each sample, and the plate was incubated at 65“C for 2 hr.
Samples were then subjected to electrophoresis
through a 6% agarose

agarose), stained with ethidium bromide,
and photographed
over an ultraviolet light.

Procedures

Patient Tissues
DNA was extracted
from normal and tumor tissues of colon cancer
patients, starting from either frozen (Ausubel et al., 1991) or paraffinembedded
specimens
(Wright and Manos, 1990). DNA samples from
normal and tumor tissues of anaplastic
astrocytoma
patients were
kindly provided by Dr. Dan Fults. DNA samples from the peripheral
blood of myelodysplastic
syndrome patients were donated by Dr. Eitan
Friedman. NFI patients participating
in this study are those described
(Cawthon et al., 1990). The protocols for obtaining human tissue samples used in this project have been approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University
of Utah Health Sciences Center.
The colon cancer DNA sample with the Lys to Glu mutation was from
a moderately differentiated
colon adenocarcinoma
from an 83-year-old
female.
The myelodysplasia
DNA sample with the Lys to Glu mutation was
from a peripheral blood specimen diagnosed as refractory
anemia with
excess of blasts. This DNA was screened for N-ras and K-ras mutations
at codons 12,13, and 61 by an allele-specificoligonucleotide
hybridization assay, and no mutations were detected.
The patient was a 56year-old woman who subsequently
developed acute myelogenous
leukemia.
The anaplastic
astrocytoma
DNA sample with the Lys to Gln mutation was from tumor tissue removed from the right temporal lobe of a
61-year-old
male.
PCR Amplification
DNA samples were generated for SSCP analysis using PCR (7 min at
95’C, once; followed by 1 min at 95’C, 1 min at 58’C, 1 min at 72OC,
for 35 cycles;
then 10 min at 72OC) with the primer pair FLRIN
(5’~CAAACCTTATACTCAATTCTCAACTC-3’),
rFLRlN
(5’~AAGGGGAATTTAAGATAGCTAGATTATC-3’).
The reaction mixture was made
up of the following: 30-70 ng of genomic DNA, a 70 uM concentration
of each deoxynucleoside
triphosphate,
a05 uM concentration
of each
primer, 10 mM Tris (pH 6.3) 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgC&, 0.25 U of Taq
polymerase,
0.25 mM spermidine,
and 0.1 ul of [@P]dCTP
(3000 Gil
ml) in a volume of 10 ul.
SSCP Gel Analysis
PCR products were diluted 30-fold in 0.1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, then
I:1 in 95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA. 0.05% bromphenol
blue, 0.05%
xylene cyanol. Products were heated at 90°C for 3 min to denature the
DNA, cooled on ice or at room temperature,
and then loaded onto 4.5%
nondenaturing
polyacrylamide
gels (49:1 polyacrylamide:methylenebis-acrylamide)
containing
1 x or 0.5 x TBE (1 x TBE = 90 mM Trisborate (pH 7.81, 2 mM EDTA). Two conditions were routinely run for
each set of samples:
a gel at 4OC and a 5% glycerol gel at room
temperature.
Electrophoresis
was carried out for both conditions
at
40 W, constant power, in the same TBE buffer as that used in the gel.
After electrophoresis,
the gel was transferred
to Whatman 3MM paper
and dried on a vacuum slab gel dryer. Autoradiography
with Kodak
X-Omat AR film at -70aC with an intensifying
screen overnight was
usually sufficient to detect bands on film.
Sequencing
of SSCP Conformers
Individual SSCP bands were cut directly from the dried gel, placed in
100 PI of distilled water, incubated at 37°C with shaking for 1 hr, and
centrifuged
briefly to pellet debris. A IO ul aliquot of the supernatant
was used directly in a 100 ul PCR reaction. The primers used in the
original amplification
were used in this amplification
as well, except
that the 5’end of one primer contained additional sequence consisting
of the universal sequencing
primer from M13, and the 5’ end of the
other primer included the sequence of the reverse sequencing
primer.
The double-stranded
PCR product resulting from this amplification
was purified by two centrifugation
washes with a Centricon 100 column
(Amicon), then sequenced
following a test-site protocol suggested
by
Applied Biosystems,
Inc. (Foster City, CA). This involved performing

Cloning and Manual Sequencing
of the PCR Product
from the FLR Exon
PCR product was generated as above, except that a BamHl site was
added to the 5’end of the primer FLRIN and an EcoRl site was added
to the 5’ end of the primer rFLRIN. The PCR product was phenolchloroform
extracted,
ethanol precipitated,
and digested with BamHl
and EcoRI. The digested fragment
was ligated with pBluesdript
II
phagemid vector also cut with BamHl and EcoRI. The ligation mixture
was transformed
into XLI-Blue
supercompetent
cells (Stratagene).
Double-stranded

of ten independent
plasmid clones was
performed
using Sequenase Version 2.0 (US Biochemicals)
according

PCR was used to generate the mutant NFI
GRD subclones.
The first step included two PCR reactions with primer
pair GM444 (5’-GGAGATGGTGTGTCGACCATGGAAGCCAAATCACAG-3’) and rGRDMU
(5’-ACTCTGAAGTATCTGTGACATTAACTTCAA-3’, an internal antisense primer containing the mutated base [in
bold]; here, T to G to generate the A to C mutant); and primer pair
GRDMU (5’.TTGAAGTTAATGTCACAGATACTTCAGAGT-3’,
an internal sense primer containing
the mutated base [in bold]) and GM446
(5’-TAGGAl-KTCTAGAGCTCATGmTCTGGTTCTGGTGGTGGTGTT
AACGTTTTCAAAGCCTTG-x
nucleotides
encoding the KT3 epitope
are in bold). One microgram
of cDNA clone FB15 (Xu et al., 1990a)
was the template for each PCR reaction in a volume of 100 ~1. PCR
was performed with a 0.8 uM concentration
of each primer, a 0.2 mM
concentration
of each deoxynucleoside
triphosphate,
10 mM Tris (pH
6.3) 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCl*, 0.01% gelatin, and 2.5 U of Taq
polymerase.
Reactions
underwent
7 min at 95OC, once; followed by
1 min at 95OC, 2 min at 55’C, 1 min at 72OC, 25 times; 10 min at 72OC.
The second step involved only one PCR reaction with primer pair
GM444 and GM446. In the PCR reaction, 30 pl of each PCR product
from the first step was used as template. The final products obtained
after 25 cycles of amplification
(7 min at 95’C, 1 time; 1 min at 95OC,
2minat550C,2minat720C,25times;l0minat720C)weresubcloned
between the Ncol and Xbal sites of the baculovirus
transfer vector
pAcC4 (Luckow and Summers,
1966).
