A macroscopic method using the dyes Alcian blue and phloxine is described for the investigation of squamous metaplasia in the larynx. The method also demonstrates an intermediate type epithelium about which little is known. The gross staining of the tissues is based upon the differential penetration of the dyes through squamous, intermediate and respiratory epithelia, and on the strong chemical complex formed between Alcian blue and mucin. The method is particularly useful for research purposes owing to the permanency of the staining result.
