Summary
We have identified three different tyrosinase gene mutant alleles in four unrelated patients with type TB
("yellow") oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) and thus have demonstrated that type TB OCA is allelic to type
IA (tyrosinase negative) OCA. In an inbred Amish kindred, type IB OCA results from homozygosity for a
Pro-'Qeu substitution at codon 406. In the second family, type IB OCA results from compound heterozygosity for a type IA OCA allele (codon 81 Pro-*Leu) and a novel type IB allele (codon 275 ValFPhe). In the
third patient, type IB OCA results from compound heterozygosity for the same type IB allele (codon 275
Val-"Phe) and a novel type IB OCA allele. In a fourth patient, type IB OCA results from compound heterozygosity for the codon 81 type IA OCA allele and a type IB allele that contains no identifiable abnormalities;
dysfunction of this type IB allele apparently results from a mutation either well within one of the large introns
or at some distance from the tyrosinase gene. In vitro expression of the Amish type TB allele in nonpigmented
HeLa cells demonstrates that the Pro-->Leu substitution at codon 406 greatly reduces but does not abolish
tyrosinase enzymatic activity, a finding consistent with the clinical phenotype.

Introduction

Human oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive genetic disorders
of pigmentation. Affected individuals are characterized by reduced or absent melanin synthesis in pigment
cells of the skin, hair follicles, and eyes. Hypopigmentation of the retina is associated with decreased visual
acuity, photophobia, and varying degrees of nystagmus (reviewed by King and Summers 1988; Witkop
et al. 1989). Type I OCA results from deficient activity
of melanocyte tyrosinase (E.C.1.14.18.1), the enzyme that catalyzes the first two steps in the melanin
biosynthetic pathway: (1) the hydroxylation of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) and (2) the

subsequent oxidation of dopa to dopaquinone (Lerner
and Fitzpatrick 1950). In classic, type IA (tyrosinasenegative) OCA, tyrosinase activity and melanin biosynthesis are entirely absent, whereas, in type IB OCA,
tyrosinase activity and melanin production are greatly
reduced.
Type IB ("yellow") OCA was first described in an
inbred Amish kindred (Nance et al. 1970) and was
later identified in other populations. Patients with type
IB OCA completely lack detectable pigment at birth
and initially are indistinguishable from patients with
classic, type IA OCA. However, patients with type IB
OCA accumulate some melanin pigment, principally
the yellow-red pheomelanins, during childhood and
adulthood. The activity of hairbulb tyrosinase is greatly
reduced in type IB OCA, and the existence of apparent
type IA/IB OCA compound heterozygotes suggests
that type IA and type IB OCA are allelic (Hu et al.
1980; Giebel et al. 1990). Cloning and sequence analysis of the human tyrosinase gene, located in chromosome segment 11ql4-->q21 (Barton et al. 1988), has
permitted the recent identification of several different

tyrosinase gene mutations in patients with type I OCA
(Tomita et al. 1989; Giebel et al. 1990, 1991b, and
in press; Kikuchi et al. 1990; Spritz et al. 1990, 1991;
Takeda et al. 1990). In the present paper we directly
demonstrate that types IA and IB OCA are allelic and
describe two novel missense mutations of the tyrosinase gene in four patients with type IB OCA. Furthermore, we show that the "Amish" type IB OCA mutation results in a >90% reduction in tyrosinase
enzymatic activity in HeLa cells transfected with the
mutant gene, as compared with that in cells transfected with the normal gene. This correlates well with
the accumulation of a small amount of melanin pigment by individuals homozygous for this allele.
Patients and Methods
Patients
Patient 1 (fig. 1A) was an adult Caucasian male, one
of several members of an inbred Amish kindred with
OCA type IB. This is the same kindred reported in
the original description of type IB OCA (Nance et al.
1970); patient 1 is individual VII.9 in that report.

Note that considerable dark eumelanin pigment has
accumulated in his scalp and facial hair over time.
Patient 2 (fig. 1B) was an adult Caucasian female
with typical features of OCA type IB. Detailed clinical
descriptions and genetic analyses of her family have
also been published previously (Hu et al. 1980; Giebel
et al. 1990); patient 2 is patient 11 of family 1 in
Giebel et al. (1990). Note that a moderate amount of
yellow-red pheomelanin has accumulated in her scalp
and facial hair over time.
Patient 3 (fig. 1 C) was a 19-year-old Caucasian male
with severe type IB OCA. There was very little detectable melanin pigment in his skin, hair, and eyes. His
irides were pale blue and transilluminated completely,
and his retinas had almost no detectable pigment. The
visual acuity was greatly reduced, with foveal hypoplasia, constant nystagmus, and photophobia. A small
amount of brown eumelanin pigment was evident in
both his facial hair and the hair on his extremities.
Patient 4 (fig. 1D) was a 15-year-old Caucasian
male with typical type IB OCA. An extensive study of
his very large family has been published (Giebel et al.
1990); patient 4 is patient IX of family 2 in that same
report. Small to moderate amounts of both yellow
pheomelanin and dark eumelanin pigment have accumulated in his scalp and facial hair over time.
Quantitative assay of tyrosinase (tyrosine hydroxylase) in freshly epilated anagen hairbulbs (Kind and

Olds 1985) revealed no detectable activity, except for
patient 3, in whom tyrosinase activity was 0.255 pmol
tyrosine oxidized/120 min/hairbulb (normal range
for blond individuals 1.50 ± 0.85; n = 13).
Analysis of Genetic Linkage

DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes
of patient 1 and many members of his Amish kindred
(fig. 2), was digested with TaqI, and was analyzed
by Southern blot hybridization (Southern 1975) using
cloned human tyrosinase cDNA as probe (Kwon et al.
1987). Autoradiograms were scored for polymorphic
2.8-kb versus 2.4-kb TaqI tyrosinase gene fragments
(Spritz et al. 1988), and TaqI haplotypes were assigned to each individual. The OCA carrier status of
all family members was defined by quantitative assay
of tyrosinase (tyrosine hydroxylase) activity in anagen
hairbulbs (King and Olds 1985). Linkage between the
tyrosinase TaqI RFLP and type IB OCA was assessed
by determination of logarithm-of-odds (lod) scores by
using version 3 (1987) of the LIPED program (Ott
1974). Tyrosinase gene RFLP linkage analyses of the
families of patients 2 and 4 have been published previously (Giebel et al. 1990).
PCR and DNA Sequencing

DNA fragments corresponding to the five exons
plus adjacent flanking regions of the human tyrosinase
gene (Giebel et al. 1991a) were PCR amplified from
0.1-1.0 gg DNA of the four patients and were gel
purified, cloned into bacteriophage vectors Ml3mpl 8
or mpl9, and sequenced, exactly as described elsewhere (Spritz et al. 1991).

Allele-specipc Oligonucleotide Hybridization
Tyrosinase exon 2 gene fragments were PCR amplified from genomic DNA of OCA patients, their family
members, and 30 unrelated normally pigmented individuals, exactly as described elsewhere (Spritz et al.
1991). Twenty microliters of each PCR reaction was
transferred to MAGNA nylon membranes (Micron
Separations) with a Bio-Dot SF microfiltration device
(Bio-Rad). Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridizations of replicate filters were performed (Kogan and
Gitschier 1990) by using 5'-radiolabeled 19-mer oligonucleotides corresponding to the normal (5'-ATTGTCTGTAGCCGATTGG-3') and mutant (5'-ATTTTCTGTAGCCGATTGG-3') - forms of codon 275.

many members of his kindred (fig. 2), and four unrelated patients with type I OCA were PCR amplified
exactly as described elsewhere (Spritz et al. 1991).
Amplification products were digested with Mn1I and
were analyzed by PAGE for the presence of the codon

1989) according to a method described elsewhere
(Giebel and Spritz 1990b). Exon 4 of the tyrosinase
gene was PCR amplified from DNA (30 ng) of an M13
exon 4 clone containing the codon 406 mutation, by
using 20-mer oligonucleotide primers (5'-TATTTTTGAGCAGTGGCTCC-3' and 5'-TAGCTATCTACAAGATTCAG-3'). PCR conditions were as described elsewhere (Giebel and Spritz 1990b), except
that (a) only 25 cycles were performed and (b) the
annealing step was two min. An exon 2-3-4 product
was then amplified from 30 ng of tyrosinase cDNA by
using as one primer 5 pmol gel-purified mutant exon
4 PCR product and as second primer a 20-mer oligonucleotide (5'-ATTGTCTGTAGCCGATTGGA-3')
derived from the 5' end of exon 2. The resultant mutant exon 2-3-4 PCR product contained the codon 406
mutation and unique PvuII and BglII sites; these sites
were used to replace the PvuII/BglII fragment of
pcTYR by the corresponding codon 406 mutant fragment. The nucleotide sequence of the mutant expression plasmid pcTYR-T406 was verified by doublestranded DNA sequencing (Zhang et al. 1988).
Expression of tyrosinase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was assayed by transient cotransfection of either pcTYR or pcTYR-T406 plus
pSV2CAT into cultured HeLa cells by using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure (Gorman et
al. 1982). Cells were harvested 64 h after transfection,
were lysed in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH
6.8, 0.5% Triton X-100, and were sonicated. After
centrifugation the supernatant was dialyzed twice
against 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. Fluorometric assay of cell extracts for tyrosinase (tyrosine
hydroxylase) activity was done according to a method
described elsewhere (Husain et al. 1982), except that

4 mM ascorbic acid was included as reductant for
tyrosine hydroxylation (Tripathi et al. 1988) and to
reduce any dopaquinone formed by tyrosinase back to
dopa; thus, measurement of amount of dopa formed
provides a true estimate of the tyrosine hydroxylase
activity of tyrosinase. The 55-gl reactions containing
0.1 mM L-tyrosine, 5 gM L-dopa, 4 mM ascorbic
acid, 40 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.8, and
15 Rl cell extract were incubated for 4 h. Production of
dopa was measured by specific fluorescence at 360-nm
excitation and 490-nm emission wavelengths. Protein
concentrations of cell extracts were determined according to the method of Peterson (1977) and CAT
activities were determined according to the method of
Gorman et al. (1982).
Results
Type IB OCA Is Linked to the Tyrosinase Gene

TaqI digests were used to assign tyrosinase RFLP
haplotypes to patient 1 and other members of the original Amish kindred with type IB OCA (fig. 2). Genetic
linkage analysis of this family demonstrated linkage
between OCA and the tyrosinase gene (lod score =
1.07, 0 = 0). Although part of this kindred was relatively uninformative (fig. 2B), the OCA IB trait cosegregated with the 2.8-kb polymorphic TaqI tyrosinase
gene fragment; all individuals studied in the Amish
kindred with homozygous type IB OCA were homozygous for the 2.8-kb TaqI fragment.
We have previously published genetic linkage analyses of the families of patients 2 and 4 (Giebel et al.
1990) and have shown that in both families the type
I OCA mutations are linked to the tyrosinase gene.
Lod scores in these two families were 1.50 (8 = 0) and
6.17 (0 = 0), respectively. In both families individuals
with type IB OCA were apparent compound heterozygotes for a type IB OCA allele and a frequent type
IA OCA allele, containing a Pro--Leu substitution at
codon 81 (Giebel et al. 1990).
Patient I Is Homozygous for a Novel Missense Mutation
at Codon 406

To identify mutations that cause type IB OCA, we
PCR amplified each of the five exons of the tyrosinase
gene plus adjacent noncoding sequences from genomic
DNA of each of the four patients by using oligonucleotide primers derived from the normal tyrosinase gene
sequence (Giebel et al. 1 991a). Amplification products
were cloned in M13 vectors, and their DNA sequences
were determined.

strand.

Analysis of the tyrosinase gene sequence of patient
1 revealed that he is homozygous for a novel missense
substitution, CCT (Pro)--CTT (Leu), at codon 406
(fig. 3). No other abnormalities were found. At two
nonpathological polymorphic sites within the tyrosinase-coding sequence, codon 192 TCT (Ser) versus
TAT (Tyr) (Giebel and Spritz 1990a) and codon 402
CGA (Arg) versus CAA (Gln) (Tripathi et al., in press),
patient 1 was homozygous, having TAT (Tyr) and
CGA (Arg), respectively. Both of these polymorphisms are commonly found among normal individ-

uals.
The codon 406 CCT--CTT substitution abolishes
an MnlI restriction site, enabling us to easily test
whether this substitution is a type IB OCA mutation
or a nonpathologic polymorphism. Exon 4 tyrosinase
gene fragments were amplified from genomic DNAs
of all members of the Amish kindred shown in figure
2, were digested with Mn1I, and were analyzed by gel
electrophoresis (data not shown). The distribution of
the codon 406 substitution correlated perfectly with
carrier status as determined by assay of tyrosinase enzymatic activity and RFLP data. All individuals with
type IB OCA were homozygous for the codon 406
mutation; all OCA carriers were heterozygous for the
codon 406 mutant allele; and all of the noncarriers had
only the normal allele. We also analyzed the DNAs
of 14 unrelated patients with type I OCA, including
patients 2-4 of the present study; none had the codon

406 mutant allele. We have also not detected the codon 406 substitution by DNA sequence analyses of 16
additional unrelated type IA OCA patients and two
normal individuals. Therefore, the codon 406 substitution is not a common polymorphism but instead
appears to be a private type IB OCA mutation in the
Amish.
Patients 2 and 3 are Compound Heterozygotes for a
Novel Missense Substitution at Codon 275 and for
Different Type IA OCA Mutations

The nucleotide sequence of tyrosinase gene fragments of patient 2 showed her to be a compound heterozygote for two different OCA alleles, each containing a different missense substitution. One allele,
containing a CCT (Pro)--CTT (Leu) substitution at
codon 81, is a relatively frequent type IA OCA allele
(Giebel et al. 1990; authors' unpublished data). The
patient's type IB OCA allele contains a novel substitution, GTC (Val)--TTC (Phe) at codon 275 (fig. 4).
No other abnormalities were found. Patient 2 was
homozygous for TCT (Ser) at polymorphic codon 192
and for CGA (Arg) at polymorphic codon 402.
Tyrosinase gene DNA sequence analysis of patient
3 showed that he is also a compound heterozygote,
for the same codon 275 Pro-*Leu type IB OCA mutant
allele (fig. 4) and a novel allele, containing a frameshift
(CGT--CCGT) at codon 501 (fig. 5). The frameshift

IB OCA allele (Giebel et al. 1990). Nucleotide sequence analysis of the tyrosinase genes of patient 4
confirmed this, demonstrating the codon 81 substitution in one of his two alleles. However, no abnormality could be identified in the other allele, including in
the five exons, 39-87 bases of the adjacent intervening
sequences, 693 bases of the 5' promoter region, and
388 bases of the 3' flanking region. These data suggest
that the type IB OCA mutation in patient 4 may be
either deep within one of the four large intervening
sequences or at some distance from the tyrosinase
gene. This apparent type IB OCA allele is associated
with TAT (Tyr) at polymorphic codon 192 and with
CAA (Gln) at polymorphic codon 402.

at codon 501 results in alteration or deletion of the 29
carboxyl-terminal residues of tyrosinase; therefore,
this is most likely a type IA OCA allele. No other
abnormalities were found. Patient 3 was homozygous
for TCT (Ser) at polymorphic codon 192 and was
heterozygous CGA (Arg)/CAA (Gln) at polymorphic
codon 402.
To determine whether the codon 275 tyrosinase
gene substitution is causative of type IB OCA or is
simply a nonpathologic polymorphism, we PCR amplified exon 2 gene fragments from DNA of patient 2,
her entire family (see fig. 1 in Giebel et al. 1990), and
30 unrelated normal individuals. The exon 2 amplification products were then analyzed by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization (data not shown). The distribution of the codon 275 substitution correlated
perfectly with tyrosinase enzymatic activity and RFLP
data. All three individuals with type IB OCA in this
family were compound heterozygotes for the codon
275 and codon 81 mutant alleles; all type IB OCA
carriers were heterozygous for only the codon 275
mutant allele; and all of the noncarriers and the 30
unrelated normal individuals had only normal alleles.

The Amish Codon 406 Pro--Leu Substitution Drastically
Reduces Tyrosinase Enzymatic Activity

To investigate the effect of the Amish codon 406
CCT (Pro)--CTT (Leu) type IB OCA mutation, we
introduced this substitution into the human tyrosinase
cDNA expression plasmid pcTYR (Bouchard et al.
1989) by site-directed in vitro mutagenesis. The wildtype (pcTYR) and the mutant tyrosinase (pcTYRT406) expression plasmids were each transiently cotransfected along with pSV2CAT into cultured HeLa
cells. The cells were harvested 64 h after transfection,
and tyrosinase (tyrosine hydroxylase) activity, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity, and protein concentrations were determined (table 1). The
CAT activity served as an internal control for transfection efficiency. As shown in table 1, the tyrosinase
activity in HeLa cells transfected with the codon 406
Pro-*Leu mutant tyrosinase expression plasmid was
only ".7% of the activity in cells transfected with the
wild-type plasmid.
It is interesting that, in general, the amount of pigment apparent in the four type IB OCA patients in the
present study correlates only modestly well with their
genotypes. Patient 1, who has the most apparent melanin pigment (fig. 1A), is homoallelic for type IB OCA,
whereas patients 2-4, who all have considerably less
melanin pigment (fig. 1B-D), are all type IA/IB compound heterozygotes. The pigmentation phenotype of
type IB OCA is quite homogeneous within sibships
(family 1 and family 2). However, there can be considerable phenotypic differences among unrelated type IB
OCA patients, even among those with quite similar
genotypes, and significant age-related accumulation
of predominantly yellow-red pheomelanin is not a
constant feature. In addition, the clinical phenotype
among patients with type IB OCA does not correlate

well with measured levels of hairbulb tyrosinase activity, the assay for which is unreliable toward the low
end of its range. Patients 2 and 3 are both type IA/IB
compound heterozygotes and share the same codon
275 Val- Phe type IB OCA allele (fig. 4). However,
patient 2 (fig. 1B) has much more apparent pigment
than does patient 3 (fig. 1C), who appears almost as
severely hypopigmented as do patients with type IA
OCA, despite having the highest hairbulb tyrosinase
activity among the patients studied here, at the low
end of the normal range. These differences of pigmentation phenotypes, along with poor correlation between clinical phenotype and measured tyrosinase enzymatic activity in type IB OCA, most likely result
from epistatic phenomena acting on a background of
low residual tyrosinase activity. By way of illustration,
we note that the normally pigmented parents and sibs
of patient 2 are very darkly complected, whereas those
of patient 3 are very lightly complected; therefore, in
the absence of OCA, patient 2 might otherwise have
been darkly complected, whereas patient 3 might otherwise have been lightly complected.
We have shown that the phenotypes of both type IA
OCA and type IB OCA result from homozygosity or
compound heterozygosity for a series of allelic mutations at the human tyrosinase locus. This will greatly
enhance genetic counseling for the various forms of
type I OCA. The occurrence of the codon 275 mutant
allele in both proband 2 and proband 3, who are unrelated, suggests that this may be a frequent allele in
patients with type IB OCA. Furthermore, the availability of carrier detection for the Amish codon 406

mutant allele offers obvious advantages for genetic
counseling of this high-risk population.
Discussion

Type IB OCA was first described by Nance et al.
(1970) in an inbred Amish kindred. Tyrosinase enzymatic activity is decreased or undetectable, respectively, in type IB OCA and type IA OCA, and the
observation of families with apparent type IA/ IB OCA
compound heterozygotes strongly suggested that these
two forms of OCA are allelic (Hu et al. 1980; Giebel
et al. 1990). Recent advances in recombinant-DNA
technology made it possible to investigate the molecular relationship between type IA OCA and type IB
OCA. In the present study we have considered four
unrelated patients with type IB OCA, including one of
the original inbred Amish kindred described by Nance
et al. (1970). Tyrosinase gene RFLP linkage analyses
were consistent with allelism of types IA and IB OCA.
Nucleotide sequence analysis of the tyrosinase genes
of patient 1, the Amish patient, demonstrated that he
is homozygous for a novel Pro Leu substitution at
codon 406 (fig. 3). Patient 2 was a compound heterozygote for a previously published (Giebel et al. 1990)
type IA OCA allele, i.e., codon 81 Pro- Leu, and a
novel allele containing a type IB OCA substitution,
i.e., codon 275 Val-)Phe (fig. 4). Patient 3 was a compound heterozygote for the same codon 275 Val Phe
type IB OCA allele and a novel type IA OCA allele,
containing a frameshift at codon 501. Patient 4 was
also apparently a compound heterozygote, for the codon 81 Pro--Leu type IA OCA allele and a tyrosinase
allele in which we detected no abnormality. It is likely
that this allele contains a mutation either well within
one of the four large intervening sequences or at some
distance from the tyrosinase structural gene. Thus, at
least three different tyrosinase alleles can be associated
with type IB OCA.
We tested the effect that the Amish codon 406 ProLeu substitution had on tyrosinase enzymatic activity,
by expressing a tyrosinase cDNA containing this mutation in HeLa cells. We found that the codon 406
substitution greatly decreases, but does not abolish,
tyrosinase activity in vitro, a finding consistent with
the "leaky" in vivo phenotype of type IB OCA in patients homozygous for this mutant allele.
It is interesting that, in general, the amount of pigment apparent in the four type IB OCA patients in the
present study correlates only modestly well with their
genotypes. Patient 1, who has the most apparent mela-

1166

nin pigment (fig. 1A), is homoallelic for type TB OCA,
whereas patients 2-4, who all have considerably less
melanin pigment (fig. 1B-D), are all type IA/1B compound heterozygotes. The pigmentation phenotype of
type IB OCA is quite homogeneous within sibships
(family 1 and family 2). However, there can be considerable phenotypic differences among unrelated type IB
OCA patients, even among those with quite similar
genotypes, and significant age-related accumulation
of predominantly yellow-red pheomelanin is not a
constant feature. In addition, the clinical phenotype
among patients with type IB OCA does not correlate
well with measured levels of hairbulb tyrosinase activity, the assay for which is unreliable toward the low
end of its range. Patients 2 and 3 are both type IA/IB
compound heterozygotes and share the same codon
275 Val--Phe type IB OCA allele (fig. 4). However,
patient 2 (fig. 1B) has much more apparent pigment
than does patient 3 (fig. 1C), who appears almost as
severely hypopigmented as do patients with type IA
OCA, despite having the highest hairbulb tyrosinase
activity among the patients studied here, at the low
end of the normal range. These differences of pigmentation phenotypes, along with poor correlation between clinical phenotype and measured tyrosinase enzymatic activity in type IB OCA, most likely result
from epistatic phenomena acting on a background of
low residual tyrosinase activity. By way of illustration,
we note that the normally pigmented parents and sibs
of patient 2 are very darkly complected, whereas those
of patient 3 are very lightly complected; therefore, in
the absence of OCA, patient 2 might otherwise have
been darkly complected, whereas patient 3 might otherwise have been lightly complected.
We have shown that the phenotypes of both type IA
OCA and type IB OCA result from homozygosity or
compound heterozygosity for a series of allelic mutations at the human tyrosinase locus. This will greatly
enhance genetic counseling for the various forms of
type I OCA. The occurrence of the codon 275 mutant
allele in both proband 2 and proband 3, who are unrelated, suggests that this may be a frequent allele in
patients with type IB OCA. Furthermore, the availability of carrier detection for the Amish codon 406
mutant allele offers obvious advantages for genetic
counseling of this high-risk population.
