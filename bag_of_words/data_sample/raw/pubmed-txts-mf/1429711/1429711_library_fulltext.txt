Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) is a copper-containing 1950). Tyrosinase has also been reported to catalyze a third,

OCA phenotypes into normal human tyrosinase cDNAby
site-directed mutagenesis, transfected HeLa cells with the
mutant cDNAs using a transient expression vector, propagated the transfected cells at 31 or 37 “C, and assayed the
catalytic functions of the expressed proteins produced at the
two temperatures. The structure of human tyrosinase andthe
locations of the mutations studied here are summarized in
Fig. 2. Our results clearly demonstrate that mammalian tyrosinase has the third catalytic function (DHI oxidase) reported earlier by Korner and Pawelek (1982). We further
show that the dopa oxidase and DHI oxidase activities of
normal tyrosinase are temperature-sensitive, whereas tyrosine hydroxylase activity is not. Moreover, all of the amino
acid substitutionstested resulted in variable but parallel
effects on the dopa oxidase and DHI oxidase activities, suggesting that these two catalytic activities probably involve a
single catalytic site. However, several substitutions exerted
different effects on the tyrosine hydroxylase versus the dopa/
DHI oxidase activities. This suggests that, although some

structural elements of the tyrosinase polypeptide are undoubtedly shared, the tyrosine hydroxylase and dopa/DHI oxidase
catalytic sitesof tyrosinase are distinct.
EXPERIMENTALPROCEDURES

Site-directed in Vitro Mutagenesis
All mutant constructions were based on the normal human tyrosinase cDNA expression plasmid, pcTYR (Bouchard et al., 1989), as
described below. Nucleotide sequences of all constructs were verified
by double-stranded DNA sequencing of the resultant plasmids (Zhang
et al., 1988).
pcTYRAl9-157”pcTYR was digested with MscI and the largest
fragment (4.5 kilobases) was gel purified and circularized by selfligation.
pcTYRA316-443”pcTYR was digested with PuuII plus BglII. The
largest fragment was end repaired, gel purified, and ligated in the
presence of a nonphosphorylated EcoRI linker (5’-GGAATTCC-3’;
New England Biolabs) that restored the translational reading frame.
pcTYRA316-529”This
mutant was constructed as for
pcTYRA316-443 except thatthe PvuII-BglII fragment was selfligated in the absence of linker, resulting in a frameshift distal to
codon 316.
pcTYRAla206Thr-AnM13 clone containing tyrosinase exon 1
from a patient with type IAOCA and missense substitution codon
Ala2“-tThr (Proband 3; Tripathi et al., 1992) was used as template
to amplify a mutant exon 1 cDNA segment by the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) using the primer pair 5”TGCTCGTGGCTGTTTT
GTAC-3’/5’-CTGCCAAGAGGAGAAGAATG-3’
as described by
Giebel and Spritz (1990). The 820-bp PCR product was gel purified
and 1 pg was used as one primer for a subsequent round of PCR as
above using 60 ng of pcTYR as template; the other primer was 5’CTGAATCTTGTAGATAGCTA-3’. The resulting 1364-bp mutant
exon 1-exon 4 PCR product was digested with BstXI, gel purified,
and used to replace the homologous fragment of pcTYR.
pcTYRThr373Lys-AnM13 clone containing tyrosinase exon 3
from a patient with type IAOCA and missense substitution codon
ThP-Lys (Spritz et aL, 1990)was used as template to PCR amplify
a mutant exon 3 cDNA segment as above, using the primer pair 5’-A

TTGTCTGTAGCCGATTGGA-3’/5’-TCCCTGTACCTGGGACAT
T T - 3 ’ . The 300-bp PCR product was gel purified and 400 ng was
used as one primer for a subsequent round of PCR as above; the other
primer was 5”CTGAATCTTGTAGATAGCTA-3’. The resulting
547-bp mutant exon 2-exon 4 PCR product was digested with PuuII
plus BglII, gel purified, and used to replace the homologous fragment
of pcTYR.

substitution corresponding to thatin apatient with type IA OCA and
missense substitution codon AspW+Asn (Spritz et al., 1990). The
rest of this construction was exactly as for pcTYRThr373Lys.
Plasmids pcTYRArg402Gln (Tripathi et al., 1991), pcTYRPro406Leu (Giebel et al., 1991d), and pcTYRArg422Gln (Giebel
et al., 1 9 9 1 ~ have
)
been described previously. These, respectively,
contain missense substitutions, codons Arg40241n,Pro406+Leu, and
Arg"'+Gln.
Transient Transfection Protocols
HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
containing 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone Laboratories) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/
ml streptomycin. The normal and mutant human tyrosinase cDNA
expression plasmids were transiently transfected into four replicate
100-cmZplates of subconfluent HeLa cells (20 pg/plate) by the Ca2+phosphate precipitation procedure (Graham and van der Eb, 1973).
Replicate sets of cells were cultured at 31 or 37 "C for 4 h, after which
time themedium was replaced and thecells were propagated at 31 or
37 "C. Cells were harvested 64 h after transfection; the monolayers
were washed three timeswith cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the
cells were scraped and pelleted. Triton X-100-solubilizedcell extracts
were dialyzed and prepared as previously described (Tripathi et al.,
1991) and stored frozen at -80 "C; protein concentrations in the cell
extracts were determined by the microassay method of Peterson
(1977) and/or by the method of Bramhall et al. (1969).
Melanogenic Assays
The various assays for melanogenic activities were performed on
cell extracts (adjusted to 1 mg/ml protein) as previously detailed and
referenced below.
Tyrosine Hydroxylase Assay-Assay of tyrosine hydroxylase activity of cell extracts was performed as described by Husain et al. (1982),
except that 4 mM ascorbic acid was included in the reaction mixture
as reductant (Tripathi et al., 1988). The added ascorbic acid reduces
any dopaquinone formed by tyrosinase immediately back to dopa and
thus provides an accurate measurement of only the tyrosine hydroxylase activity. The reaction mixtures contained 100 p~ L-tyrosine, 5
/IM L-dopa, 4 mM ascorbic acid, 40 mM Na phosphate buffer, pH 6.8,
and 25 p1 of cell extract in a total volume of 55 pl. Incubation of the
assays was at 37 "C for 4 h, and production of dopa was measured by
specific fluorescence a t 360 nm excitation and 490 nm emission
wavelengths.
Dopa Oxidase Assay-Dopa oxidase activity was measured in two
ways; by HPLC assay, as the disappearance of dopa and the appearance of dopachrome, as detailed previously by Tsukamotoet al.
(1992a, 1992b), and summarized below. The reaction mixtures contained 500 p M dopa, 50 mM Na phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and 40 p1
of cell extract in a total volume of 50 pl. Data were converted to
picomoles by measurement of peaks resolved by HPLC aftercomparison with known standards(Palumbo et al., 1987). Dopa oxidase
activity was also measured using incorporation of [3-'4C]dopa (12
mCi/mmol; Amersham Corp.) into insoluble melanin, as previously
described (Hearing and Ekel, 1976; Hearing, 1987). Aliquots of the
reactions performed a t 37 "C for 30 min were removed to 3MM filter
paper discs, air dried, and measured for radioactivity ina liquid
scintillation counter following washing as detailed by Jimenez et al.
( 1988).
DHI OxidaseAssay-DHI
oxidase activity was assayed using
HPLC as previously detailed by Tsukamoto et al. (199213). Briefly,
the reaction mixtures contained 500 p~ DHI, 50 mM Na phosphate
buffer, pH 6.8, and 40 pl of cell extract in a total volume of 50 pl.
Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were removed after incubation at
37 "C for 30 min and analyzed for DHI depletion by HPLC; all HPLC
analyses were performed on a Beckman Model 344 instrument using
a C18 5-pm pore column (4.6 X 250 mm). The mobile phase was
aqueous 0.15 M NaZB407,25% (v/v) methanol, adjusted to pH 2.5
with HCl, as described earlier (Palumbo et al., 1987). Detection of
compounds was performed by absorbance at 280 nm and/or by liquid
scintillation counting of eluted radioactive peaks. Measurement of
retention times, peak areas, and radioactivity, and comparison with
external calibration curves for DHI, DHICA, and for radioactive
precursors allowed quantitative analysis of melanogenic indoles. Assays were routinely performed in duplicate and results are presented

as themeans of the independent assays f S.E. DHIand DHICA used
as standards were prepared by standard procedures (Benigni and
Minnis, 1965), and were the generous gift of Drs. Anna Palumbo and
Giuseppe Prota (University of Naples).
Melanin Formation Assay-Melanin production was measured by
radiometric assay, following the incorporation of ~-[U-"C]tyrosine
in acid-insoluble melanin, as detailed previously by Hearing (1987).
The reaction mixtures contained 50 p~ radiolabeled tyrosine, 5 p M
dopa, 50 mM Na phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and 30 pl of cell extract
in a total volume of 50 pl. Aliquots of the reactions performed at
37 "C for 60 min were removed to 3MM filter paper discs, air dried,
and measured for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter following washing as detailed by Jim6nez et al. (1988).
RESULTS

Differential Thermostability of theCatalytic Activitiesof
NormalHumanTyrosinase
Expressed in HeLa Cells-As
shown in Table I, the specific activity of tyrosine hydroxylase
was similar in HeLa cells transiently transfected and propagated with pcTYR at 31 and 37 "C, consistent with our
previous reports (Giebel et aL, 1991c, 1991d; Tripathi et al.,
1991). In contrast, the specific activities of dopa oxidase
(Table 11) and DHIoxidase (Table 111) were both significantly
decreased (by 70 and 73%, respectively) in cells transfected
and propagated at 37 "C compared to cells grown at 31 "C.
The production of melanin (Table IV) by these same extracts
was decreased by 74% following growth at 37 "C, consistent
with the results of the dopa and DHI oxidase assays. These
results, obtained by transfection of the wild-type tyrosinase
gene into HeLa cells, demonstrate conclusively that all three
enzyme activities (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopa oxidase, and
DHI oxidase) reside on the same polypeptide. Thesedata
further suggest that the dopa oxidase and DHI oxidase activities of normal human tyrosinase are temperature-sensitive
in HeLa cells, whereas the tyrosine hydroxylase activity of
tyrosinase is thermostable. (It should be noted that in early
experiments, we determined that freeze-thawing of these samples had no demonstrable effect on their catalytic activities
or on their stabilities.) Furthermore, the melanin production
data suggest that, although tyrosine hydroxylase activity is
necessary for melanin production, distal reactions in the
pathway can be rate-limiting over relatively brief reaction
periods.
