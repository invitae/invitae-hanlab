Malignant
hyperthermia
(MH) is an autosomal
dominant neuromuscular disease involving defects in
calcium release (Britt, 1989). Exposure of MH-susceptible (MHS) individuals
to inhalational
anesthetics
and skeletal muscle relaxants leads to sustained muscle contraction,
a condition dependent on elevated
sarcoplasmic free Ca2’. Attendant hypermetabolism,
elevated temperature and blood salt, and pH imbalance can result in neurological, liver, and kidney damage and are potentially fatal unless the conditions are
reversed. The primary MH defect is believed to lie in
hypersensitive gating of the MHS Ca2+ release channels of human and porcine skeletal muscle sarcoplas’ Present

mic reticulum
(ryanodine receptors), since channel
opening is facilitated and closing is inhibited (Endo et
al., 1983; Ohnishi et aZ., 1983; Fill et aZ., 1990). The
RYRl gene encoding the skeletal muscle ryanodine
receptor (Zorzato et al., 1990) has been localized to
human chromosome 19q13.1 (MacKenzie et aZ., 1990)
and linked to mutations causing MH susceptibility in
humans (MacLennan
et al., 1990). Linkage studies
(Harbitz et al., 1990) have also implicated the RYRI
gene in the MHS phenotype in swine. We have, therefore, undertaken a systematic search for genetic alteration in the RYRl gene in both pig and human MHS
individuals.
In a study of MH swine, we found that
replacement of Cl843 in the cDNA from an MH normal (MHN)
pig with T1843 in the cDNA from an
MHS pig was the only nucleotide substitution,
of 18
observed, that resulted in an amino acid substitution
(Fujii et al., 1991). This base substitution,
leading to
the replacement of arginine 615 with cysteine, was
correlated with and likely to be causative of MH in
over 450 animals from six breeds of pigs (maximum
lod score of 101.75 at flrmu = 0.0 in 338 informative
meioses; Fujii et aZ., 1991; Otsu et al., 1991). By analogy, the corresponding
human mutation
would be
likely to predispose to at least one form of human
MH. We now report that the corresponding base substitution and amino acid replacement occurs in a human MH family where its inheritance can be correlated with inheritance of MH susceptibility.
We tested for the presence of the potential alteration (C1840-*T) in human genomic DNA by a combination of oligonucleotide
probing, restriction endo-

Malignant
hyperthermia
(MH) is a devastating,
potentially lethal response to anesthetics that occurs in genetically predisposed
individuals.
The skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYRZ) gene has been linked to porcine and
human ME. Furthermore,
a Cys for Arg substitution
tightly linked to, and potentially
causative of, porcine MH
has been identified in the ryanodine receptor. Analysis of
36 human families predisposed to malignant
hyperthermia
has revealed the presence, and cosegregation
with phenotype, of the corresponding
substitution
in a single family.
This substitution,
by analogy to the findings in pig, may be
causal for predisposition
to MH in this family.

nuclease digestion, and single- and double-stranded
DNA sequencing. Genomic DNA was isolated from
blood of MHS and MHN individuals (Miller et al.,
1988). A sequence of 74 bp between nucleotides 1808
and 1881 (Fig. 1A) was amplified by the polymerase
chain reaction (Saiki et aZ., 1988) for analysis by either oligonucleotide hybridization or RsaI digestion,
using 200-500 ng of genomic DNA and 100 ng of each
primer. The forward primer (primer 1) (5’-GTTCCCTGTGTGTGTGTGCAATGGTG
- 3’) corresponded to human RYRl cDNA nucleotides 1808 to
1831 with two mismatches (underlined) since the
primer was of porcine origin; T for C at position 1809
and C for T at position 1824. The last 24 nucleotides
of the reverse primer (primer 2) (5’-ATCTCTAGAGCCAGGGAGCAAGTTCTCAGTAAT-3’)
were complementary to nucleotides 1858 to 1881 in human
RYRl cDNA, while the first nine contained an XbaI
restriction endonuclease site that facilitated subcloning. PCR reaction conditions were denaturation at
94°C for 40 s, annealing at 52°C for 2 min, and extension at 72°C for 3 min for 35 cycles with a final cycle
of 7 min at 72°C in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-

Elmer Cetus) using a Mg2+ concentration of 1.5 mA4
in the buffer provided by Perkin-Elmer Cetus. Alternatively, amplification was performed in the buffer
described by Kogan et al. (1987) under the following
conditions: ramp to 94°C in 30 s, denaturation at
94°C for 40 s, ramp to 58°C in 30 s, annealing at 58°C
for 1 min 30 s, ramp to 72°C in 30 s, and extension at
72°C for 2 min 30 s for 35 cycles with a final cycle of 7
min at 72°C in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer
Cetus).
For oligonucleotide hybridization analysis, thepresence or absence of the nucleotide substitution in these
PCR products was tested by probing with allelespecific oligonucleotides (Fig. 1B). A 17-mer oligonucleotide sequence of the composition 5’-TGGCTGTACGCTCCAAC-3’
(probe 17-C(h)) and a 15-mer
oligonucleotide of the composition 5’-GGCTGTATGCTCCAA-3’ (probe 15-T(h)) were synthesized, endlabeled with 32P, and used as hybridization probes to
detect the presence of normal and mutant alleles, respectively. These probes were the human analogs of
those used successfully for analysis of the corresponding substitution in swine (Fujii et al., 1991). Hy-

bridization analysis was as described previously (Fujii
et aZ., 1991) except that washing was performed
at
59°C for probe 17C(h) and 53’C for probe 15T(h).
The restriction
endonuclease analysis depended on
the observation
that the nucleotide substitution
altered a restriction
site in the DNA. Whereas in the pig
the substitution
both deletes aHinP1 restriction
endonuclease site and creates a HgiAI site (Fujii et al.,
1991), in human the alteration
of the sequence
GTAC1840 to GTAT1840
deletes an RsaI site. Thus
digestion of the normal, but not the substituted,
74-bp
PCR product with RsaI resulted in products of 41 and
33 bp (Fig. 1C). Restriction
analysis was carried out
using standard methods and products were separated
in 20% polyacrylamide
gels.
For direct sequencing, a 136-bp product was PCRamplified as described above using the buffer of Kogan et al. (1987), with 100 ng of forward primer 1 and
100 ng of a reverse primer (primer 3) (B-ATCTCTAGACTGGTGGACATAGTTGATGAGG
- 3’) (Fig.
1A). The last 24 nucleotides
of the reverse primer
were complementary
to human RYRl cDNA nucleotides 1904 to 1925. The PCR products were purified
from agarose according to Heery et al. (1990) and direct sequencing was performed
as described by Winship (1989) using reverse primer 3.
Screening of MHS and MHN individuals from each
of 35 Canadian families predisposed to malignant hyperthermia
with the oligonucleotide
hybridization
and/or RsaI digestion tests led to the identification
of
three heterozygotes
for the C1840+T
alteration, all
within a single family (Figs. 1B and 1C). Thirty-nine
unrelated normal (MHN)
individuals
were included
in this analysis, representing
78 normal (Caucasian)
chromosomes,
none of which carried the substitution.
The substitution
in individual 32-3 from the affected
family (family 32) was also confirmed by subcloning
and single-strand
sequencing of nine clones of the 74bp PCR product. Three of the nine clones showed the
C to T substitution
(data not shown). Further confirmation was provided by direct sequencing of an amplified 136-bp product
in all five family members
(Figs. 1A and 1D). Individuals
32-1, 32-2, and 32-3
carried the substitution
while 32-4 and 32-5 did not.
The proband in family 32, a 16-year-old
healthy
female with no family history of anesthetic problems,
had experienced a previous uneventful tonsillectomy
with ether as anesthetic.
In 1975 she underwent
arthroscopy of the right knee for recurrent patella dislocation. Premeditation
was with 75 mg Demerol, 25
mg Phenergan, and 0.6 mg atropine; induction was
with 250 mg sodium pentothal and 50 mg succinylcholine. Jaw rigidity developed immediately.
She was
ventilated with 100% 0, and 2% halothane. After 5
min, an additional 30 mg succinylcholine
was administered, but masseter spasm continued. Meanwhile,
a

753

skin incision had been made. The precordial stethoscope revealed tachycardia
and arrhythmia.
Halothane was discontinued,
therefore, electrocardiogram
and temperature
monitoring
were begun and the surgery was modified. A slight but rapid (0.5”C) increase
in temperature
was noted, although the electrocardiogram had returned to normal and stayed normal. Anesthesia was maintained
with N,O/O,
and innovar.
Breathing was spontaneous.
The remainder of the anesthetic and surgical course, together with testing in
the recovery
room, were uneventful.
Other family
members had all undergone previous anesthesia with
halothane (but without
succinylcholine),
apparently
without
difficulty.
Since succinylcholine
potentiates
halothane contractures
in vitro, halothane plus succinylcholine provides a strong trigger that may be required to elicit an MH reaction when the C1840-*T
substitution
is present in the heterozygous
state.
Muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis were performed on all family members during 1975-1977. Caffeine and halothane contracture
tests were performed
essentially as described previously (MacLennan
et al.,
1990), but at 22”C, necessitating
correction
to conform with current standards. The results are summarized in Table 1. The 1% halothane contracture
test
triggered a contracture
in the proband’s
sister. The
halothane (H) test is the least sensitive test and was
performed with 1% halothane rather than the more
potent 3% halothane in current use. It is thus not
surprising
that only one individual was positive for
this test. The caffeine (C) contracture
test results
demonstrate
that the proband and her sister are susceptible to MH, her mother is on the borderline between MH susceptible and normal, and her father and
brother are normal. The caffeine plus halothane (K)
test results in the proband, her mother and her sister,
are consistent with susceptibility
to MH, whereas the
results for her brother are considered normal and for
her father indeterminate.
The caffeine plus halothane
test is the most sensitive, but attempts to define a
unique cutoff between susceptible and normal values
result in many false positives. It is thus necessary to
define an indeterminate
range where individuals
are
best left undefined. The proband’s
father falls into
this category. An individual is considered susceptible
if at least one test is positive. On the basis of the
contracture
tests, the proband, her mother and sister,
are considered to be MH susceptible, and her father
and brother to be normal. Thus, the three individuals
diagnosed as MH sensitive are the three who have the
Cys for Arg substitution.
The existence of additional
substitutions
in this
family that may contribute
to the phenotype cannot
be excluded. No such differences were observed, however, in the RYRl cDNA from an MH pig where the

Cys for Arg substitution
alone appears
to account for the phenotype (F’ujii et al., 1991).
In a companion study (Otsu et al., 1991), none of
197 heterozygous
(N/n) pigs with the corresponding
mutation
responded to a halothane challenge in a
manner indistinguishable
from their homozygous affected (n/n) siblings. By analogy with the MH pig, a
human heterozygous
for the substitution
of Cys for
Arg 614 might
be predicted to have a mild phenotype
with only a rare response to halothane alone, in line
with the weak response to halothane observed in family 32. Conversely
a human homozygous for the substitution
might be predicted to have a more severe
phenotype, corresponding
to the 94% of n/n pigs that
responded to a halothane challenge with fulminant
MH (Otsu et al., 1991). Humans with a more severe
phenotype,
in families with dominant, chromosome
19 linked segregation for predisposition
to MH, might
be expected to be heterozygous
for mutations
in the
RYRl gene more deleterious than the nucleotide substitution reported here.
A major goal in human MH research is development of a noninvasive
and accurate test for this genetic disease that can be carried out prior to anesthesia. The first step in the development of such a genetic
test is the identification
of mutations in the responsible gene. The identification
of the Cys for Arg 614
substitution
in the ryanodine receptor and its cosegregation with susceptibility
to MH provides a strong
motive for continuing the detailed systematic
search
for alterations
in the RYRl gene in individuals predisposed to MH, on the assumption
that this and
other mutations in this gene are a major cause of MH.
