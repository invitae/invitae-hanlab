The availability
of a sensitive and specific assay for formic acid
remains one of the limiting factors in our understanding of its role in the
toxicity of methanol in man and lower animals (1). A great deal of information has been generated on the oxidation of methanol in lower animals and in primates (2-5) and, recently, the disposition
of formaldehyde in animals has been studied (6). However, little is known
concerning the disposition of formate in vivo in animals despite the relative wealth of information available on the metabolism of this substance
in vitro (7,8). This is due partly to the lack of a suitable assay for formate
in body fluids and tissues.
Several methods have been used to estimate the level of formate in
body fluids. Most of these techniques take advantage of the useful analytical technology in formaldehyde
measurements. Grant (9) and later
Reitbrock et al. (10) have used this to good advantage. However, it is
our experience that procedures which depend on the reduction of formate to formaldehyde are tedious and subject to considerable variability.
Furthermore,
a steam distillation
step is necessary for proper preparation of samples of tissues and body fluids. Therefore, another method
has been developed in our laboratory.
Since the description of a bacterial dehydrogenase,
formate dehydrogenase, (EC 1.2.1.2.), by Johnson et al. (11) we have studied this enzyme either alone or in coupled reactions as a specific and sensitive
method for the determination
of formic acid. The method that is described in this report takes advantage of a coupled system of formate
dehydrogenase with a diaphorase-catalyzed
reduction of resazurin, a
nonfluorescent substance, to resorufin, a fluorescent dye which is easily
quantified by fluorometric methods. The adaptation of this coupled reaction to the measurement of organic acids was suggested by Guilbault and
his colleagues (12) and with certain adjustments to the reactions cata1 To whom reprint requests should be mailed.

lyzed by formate dehydrogenase and diaphorase a sensitive and specific
assay for formic acid in body fluids has been obtained. Its use in determining blood formic acid levels in monkeys poisoned with methanol
is described.
MATERIALS
Resazurin and resorufin were purchased from Pfaltz and Bauer. Nutrient agar was purchased from Baltimore Biological Laboratories and
yeast extract was obtained from Difco Laboratories.
Diaphorase, Type
II, NAD, and NADH were purchased from the Sigma Chemical Company. All other reagents employed in these investigations
were of the
highest available purity. Pseudomonas
oxalaticus,
strain 11883, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
METHODS
Growth

and Maintenance

of P. oxalaticus

A modification of the method of Johnson et al. (11) was employed for
the maintenance and growth of P. oxalaticus. Cultures of P. oxalaticus
are initially plated onto blood agar plates and incubated for approximately 2436 hours at 30”. The culture was then transferred to slopes
consisting of nutrient agar and 5 mM sodium oxalate. Slopes were then
incubated for 24 hours at 37” and immediately
stored at 4”. The organism
was subcultured at least once a month in this fashion.
Induction

of Formate

Dehydrogenase

in P. oxalaticus

To induce formate dehydrogenase (FDH) in P. oxalaticus,
a stored
slope of bacteria was used to inoculate 50 ml of liquid culture medium.
The growth medium consisted of (NH&S04,
2.5 g; MgS04 . 7Hz0, 0.2 g;
CaCl, * 2Hz0, 0.001 g; FeSO, . 7Hz0, 0.005 g; MnSO, . 5Hz0, 0.0025 g;
N&MOO, . 2HZ0, 0.0025 g; K2HP04, 8.7 g; NaH2P04 . 2Hz0, 7.8 g per
liter of water. Yeast extract, 0.2%, and sodium oxalate, 0.05%, were
added to this growth medium. A 50 ml aliquot of this liquid culture was
placed in an Erlenmeyer flask and incubated at 37” on a rotary shaker.
At the end of 24 hours, 10 ml of this medium was transferred to a 2 liter
Fernbach flask containing 500 ml of liquid growth medium plus 20 mM
sodium oxalate as the sole carbon source. A 1 ml aliquot of bromothymol blue solution (0.02%) was added to monitor pH changes visually.
This liquid culture was incubated at 37” on a rotary shaker and the pH of
the medium was carefully maintained at 7.0 by the addition of appropriate amounts of 1 M oxalic acid solution. The bacteria were harvested in
the logarithmic phase of growth (about 24 hours later). This was equivalent to an optical density change in the liquid growth medium of about
0.5 at 540 nm.

Extracts

Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation
in a Sorvall RC-2B
refrigerated centrifuge. All subsequent operations were carried out at a
temperature of O-4”. Pellets were washed twice with 100 vol of 50 mM
potassium phosphate buffer containing 1 mM disodium EDTA and 0.1
mM dithiothreitol
at pH 7.4. The cells were then resuspended in a given
volume of buffer and subjected to sonication (40 Watts at 20 kilocycles
for 3 minutes at 15second intervals with 30 second cooling periods).
The preparation was then centrifuged at 13,000g for 20 minutes. The
supernatant solution was then centrifuged at 165,OOOg for 36 minutes in a
Spinco model L-5 ultracentrifuge.
The supernatant was analyzed for
FDH activity.
Measurement
of Formate
(FDH) Activity

Dehydrogenase

The specific activity of the cell-free extract was determined by measuring the rate of NADH formation at 340 nm on the Gilford 2000 spectrophotometer.
A final reaction volume of 2 ml contained 1 mM sodium
formate, 2 mM NAD, 0.1 ml formate dehydrogenase (FDH) preparation
(2-3 mg protein/ml),
and 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5.
The specific activity of this preparation varied between 0.2-0.6 pmoles
NADH/mg
protein/minute.
Protein analysis was conducted using the
microbiuret method (13).
Formate

Analysis

The enzyme preparation was stored in l-2 ml fractions in small vials
at -80” in the presence of dithiothreitol
(0.1 mM) and disodium EDTA
(1.0 mM). No loss in activity was observed after 6 months of storage. It
has been shown by Guilbault and colleagues (12) that pyridine nucleotide-dependent
assays may be conducted with the use of the following coupled reactions:

Optimal conditions were determined and a routine procedure was developed from experiments described in Results. A final reaction volume of
1 ml contained NAD, 1 mM; resazurin, 20 mM; diaphorase, 0.03 units, and
FDH, 0.006 units, in 100 mrvr phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. One unit of diaphorase activity (EC 1.6.4.3) is defined as the amount of enzyme which

Standard reactions contained sodium formate
concentrations between 0.5 and 10 ~glml.
The reactions were started by the addition of FDH and incubated for
15 minutes at 37”. Reaction mixtures were placed in boiling water for 3
minutes and centrifuged to remove precipitated protein. The supernatant
was brought up to a final volume of 6 ml with water. The change in
fluorescence between 0 and 15 minutes (&) was determined using an
Aminco-Bowman
spectrophotofluorometer
with an excitation
wavelength at 565 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. A standard curve
using 0.5 to 10 pg of formate/ml of reaction mixture was prepared for each
experiment.
Arterial blood and urine samples obtained from a monkey which had
been given 3 g/kg of methanol orally were analyzed for methanol, formate, pH, pCOz and pOz. Blood gases and pH were measured using a
blood gas analyzer (Instrumentation
Laboratory, model 213). Methanol
blood levels were determined by a modification of the method of Baker
et al. (14). Formate was analyzed by the method described above. Blood
samples (1.0 ml) were diluted with 1.4 ml of H,O, thoroughly mixed and
allowed to stand for 5 minutes. Then, 0.3 ml of 7.5% ZnSO,.7H,O
was
added and samples were thoroughly mixed. Then, 0.3 ml of 0.4 N NaOH
was added dropwise with mixing and samples were centrifuged at
35,000g for 20 minutes on a RC-2B Sorvall centrifuge to sediment the
protein. Aliquots of the protein free supernatant were used for formate
and methanol analyses.
RESULTS
Specificity of Formate Dehydrogenase (FDH)

The lower limit of sensitivity for the spectrophotometric
measurement
of NADH is about 0.1 mM which can be increased greatly by determination of NADH using fluorometric techniques. However, with the use of
a crude extract of P. oxalaticus and certain body fluids the measurement
of NADH directly by fluorometric
means gave less than satisfactory
results due to fluorescent high background values. Also, attempts at
purification of the FDH yielded preparations which were much more unstable than the crude preparation. Therefore, the coupled fluorometric
method described by Guilbault et al. (12) in the presence of FDH was
used in order to obtain a reasonably fast and sensitive method for formate measurements without having to spend a great deal of time on
either enzyme purification or tissue preparation for analysis. Although
Johnson et al. (11) had shown that methanol, ethanol, formaldehyde,
oxalate, acetate, pyruvate, and malate did not react with FDH, these
studies were repeated in order to show that these and other substances
did not react or inhibit either the activity of FDH in the crude prepara-

tion or the activity of the second catalyst, diaphorase. Table 1 shows
that a number of closely related substances and physiological metabolic
intermediates do not serve as a substrate for FDH. At 0.1 mM concentrations, pyruvate, oxalate, and malate produced about a 10% inhibition
of the reaction whereas the other substances tested had no effect on the
reactions in the presence of 0.1 mM formate. The concentration
of
pyruvate and malate used in these studies represents about 20-40 times
the concentrations that would be observed when blood would be analyzed for formate under our conditions.
Determination
of Optimal Conditions for
Formate Determinations
The pH optimum reported by Quayle (15) for FDH was at 7.6. This
was repeated and found to be 7.4 using spectrophotometric
measurements at 340 nm. At pH 7.4 the Michaelis constant (K,) was found to be
0.13 mM a value similar to that reported by Quayle (15).
The reaction catalyzed by diaphorase displayed a pH optimum
between 6.0 and 6.4 and the coupled reaction had a pH optimum of 6.0
(Fig. 1). The K, for formate measured by the coupled fluorometric assay
was about 0.15 mM, a value that closely approximates the value obtained
at pH 7.4 using the spectrophotometric
method. Figure 2 shows results

units of diaphorase, and 1.0 mM NAD. The amount of formate dehydrogenase was kept at about 0.006 units/ml of reaction mixture for optimal conditions and reactions were routinely performed at 37” for 15
minutes with shaking in a Dubnoff metabolic shaker under an atmosphere of air. Under these conditions no appreciable decomposition
of
NADH occurred and the fluorescence intensity of resorutin decreased
only about 1% from values obtained at pH 7.4. A standard curve of formate concentration
as determined by the FDH assay coupled with
resazurin and diaphorase is shown in Fig. 3. It should be noted that
under these conditions the curve is not linear and a standard curve was
employed with every series of determinations.

Perchloric acid was also unsatisfactory as a
protein precipitant. Placing blood in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes
was also less satisfactory than zinc sulfate:sodium
hydroxide since the
resulting supematant retained interfering pigments and blood treated this
way contained some inhibitory
substances which were apparently removed by the zinc sulfate:sodium hydroxide precipitation.
The concentrations of zinc sulfate and sodium hydroxide carried over to reaction
mixtures did not influence reaction rates. Urine samples were treated
with one-sixth the amount of zinc sulfate:sodium hydroxide as that used
for blood, amounts which assured complete removal of protein prior to
formate analysis.

was administered orally to a pigtail monkey (Mucaca nemestrina) as a
20% solution (w/v) in water. Metabolic acidosis, indicated by a drop in
arterial pH with a concurrent decrease in pCOZ, was observed as blood
levels of formate increased. Arterial pOZ levels remained normal. This
pattern has been observed recently with other pigtail and rhesus
monkeys and these animals show the relationship
of formate blood
levels and the metabolic acidosis seen in methanol poisoning in the
monkey.
DISCUSSION

A specific and sensitive method for the determination
of formate in
body fluids was developed using FDH coupled to the diaphorasecatalyzed reduction of resazurin to resorufin. The crude extract of P.
oxalaticus which served as the enzyme source was actually a more
useful preparation than more purified preparations of this enzyme. When
the enzyme was purified from the crude extract the enzyme became
labile and lost activity rapidly while the crude extract maintained about
100% of its activity in the presence of dithiothreitol
(0.1 mM) and disodium EDTA (1.0 mM) at -80” for at least 6 months. The crude extract
can be stored in small volumes and used when needed for the measurement of formate. The use of the coupled reaction was better than the
spectrophotometric
method (15) because of an increased sensitivity
(about ten times) and the requirement for far less enzyme in reaction
mixtures. Analysis of NADH by fluorometric methods was not satisfactory because of the relatively high background fluorescence obtained
with the crude extract of enzyme in the presence of body fluids. Also,
no distillation
procedure is needed prior to analysis of formate from
blood or urine. The method described averted these problems and allowed for an economical and rapid means for formate determination.
This method can be used for a variety of purposes in laboratories
interested in toxicology and drug metabolism. The lowest level of blood
formate which can be accurately determined is about 1.0 mg%. Both
methanol and formate measurements can be performed on 0.25 ml of
blood at a low level of of formate in the blood. One example was shown
(Fig. 4) where a pigtail monkey which had received methanol became
acidotic with increasing blood levels of formate. Since a controversy
exists concerning the role of formic acid in methanol-induced
metabolic
acidosis the technique will be useful in elaborating the part played by
this acid in the overall toxicity of methanol in primates and man. Another use of this method would be the demonstration
of formate as a
product of the metabolism of certain drugs or chemicals. For example,
many compounds that might be demethylated could conceivably be converted to formate and certain one-carbon halogenated compounds may
be converted to formate in their conversion to carbon dioxide. The sen-

SUMMARY
A sensitive and specific assay for formic acid in body fluids has been
developed. The assay is based on the reaction of formate with bacterial
formate dehydrogenase coupled to a diaphorase-catalyzed
reduction of
the nonfluorescent dye resazurin to the fluorescent substance resorufin.
Formate concentrations of 0.5 &ml
of reaction mixture can be accurately measured. Small volumes of body fluids can be used for the analysis
of both methanol and formate. The procedure described is simple and
allows for the economical and rapid determination
of formate. It can be
used in studies concerned with the disposition of formate, as it relates to
methanol metabolism.
Also, it may be useful in studies where formate
might exist as a metabolic intermediate
of certain drugs or chemicals.
