The deltaF508 mutation accounts for about 53% of the molecular defects causing cystic fibrosis (CF)
in Italy. The numerous additional mutations detected so far are all relatively rare, and about 30% of
CF chromosomes carries unknown mutations in our patients. In order to identify the non-deltaF508
mutations causing C F in our population, we performed GCdamped denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) on 9 exons of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene
in a sample of 86 Italian CF patients carrying unknown mutations on at least one chromosome. Direct
sequencing of 17 samples showing an altered electrophoretic mobility allowed the identification of four
new mutations (541delC, R347H, R352Q, and ESBSX), five mutations already known (G85E,
I148T, G178R, 1078delT, and R347f), and one rare variant (1898 3A+G). The strategy based on
GC-clamped DGGE represents an efficient and rapid approach for mutation detection for those genetic
diseases, such as CF, in which a large number of rare molecular defects has been described.

INTRODUCTION
Following the identification of deltaF508 as the
major mutation causing cystic fibrosis (CF) ( I ) ,
approximately 200 additional mutations, sequence
variations, and polymotphisms have been reported
by members of the CF Genetic Analysis Consortium. The analysis of a sample of 482 Italian CF
patients revealed that the frequency of deltaF508
in our population is equal to 53.6% of the total CF
chromosomes (our unpublished results). In order
to characterize the remaining molecular defects
present in our population, we carried out GCclamped denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
(DGGE) (2,3) on several exons of the cystic fibrosis conductance transmembrane regulator (CFTR)
gene in a sample of 86 Italian CF patients, followed by direct sequencing of those samples showing an altered electrophoretic mobility. W e previously reported the detection of 6 new mutations

and of 6 known mutations in exons 10, 11, 14a,
15, 19, and 20 (4,5). The mutations present in
these exons account for about 70% of the total CF
chromosomes in our patients. The present work
reports further data on the DGGE screening of 9
additional exons which allowed the identification
of four new mutations, five mutations already
known, and one rare sequence variation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A sample of 86 unrelated CF patients, originating from all Italian regions, were selected for
DGGE analysis. Diagnosis of CF and ascertainment of pancreatic insufficiency were based on typical clinical and laboratory findings, as described

elsewhere (6). Among these patients, 62 were
compound heterozygotes for deltaF508 or another
known mutation (2 W1282X, 1 G542X, and 1
R553X) (3,7,8) and an unknown non-deltaF508
mutation. The mutations present in an additional
group of 24 patients carrying unknown nondeltaF508 mutations on both chromosomes were
investigated using genomic DNA from the patients' parents, since the possibility of detecting a
sequence variation is increased by the formation of
heteroduplexes which follows the PCR when the
DNA of an obligate heterozygote is analysed. In
this way, a total of 110 uncharacterized CF chromosomes, 58 deltaF508, 2 W1282X, 1 G542X, 1
R553X, and 48 normal chromosomes were
screened for exons 4, 7, 12, 21, and 23 and 54
uncharacterized CF chromosomes, 26 deltaF508,
and 28 normal chromosomes for exons 3, 5, 9, and
22, by DGGE of DNA fragments amplified by PCR
with specific primers coupled with GC-clamps.
PCR conditions were as already described (3).
DGGE conditions and primer sequences for exon
12 and 23 were those reported by Fanen et al. (9).
For the other exons, DGGE conditions and primer
sequences reported in Table 1 were determined using the Melt87 and SQHTX programs by L. Lerman (10). The amplified products were electrophoresed through a 6.5% acrylamide gel
containing a linearly increasing gradient of denaturant ranging either from 10 to 60% or from 30 to
80% depending on the exons being examined
(Table I), at 160 V for 2 to 4 hr. For each exon,
a series of control samples carrying known mutations, kindly provided by other members of the CF
Genetic Analysis Consortium, were analysed un-

der the same conditions and in parallel with our
samples (Table 2).
Samples showing an altered melting behaviour
were sequenced either o n double-stranded DNA
template as already described (4), or o n singlestranded DNA template, amplified using a set of
primers one of which was biotinylated at the 5'
end. The resulting biotinylated PCR product was
immobilized to magnetic streptavidine-conjugated
beads (Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin, Dynal
A.S, N-0212 Oslo, Norway) and sequenced according to the Sanger method using Sequenase
version 2 (United States Biochemical Corporation, Cleveland, OH 44122) (Fig. l). In all cases,
sequencing was performed on more than one amplified sample in order to exclude the possibility of
an error of incorporation due to Taq polymerase.
Moreover, the genetic transmission of each new
mutation was confirmed by the analysis of the
whole nuclear family in order to exclude the occurrence of de novo mutations.

RESULTS
Direct sequencing of samples containing sequence variations identified by DGGE analysis allowed the characterization of four new mutations
in exons 4, 7, and 12, five known mutations in
exons 3 , 4 , 5, and 7, and one rare variant in intron
12.
In exon 4, a frameshift mutation (541delC)
(Fig. 1) due to the deletion of C at position 541
was detected in two unrelated patients, both carrying deltaF508 o n the other chromosome and
originating from Northern Italy (Lombardy). Both
patients have pancreatic insufficiency (PI) and

carry the 541delC mutation in association with
haplotype B (KM. 19/PstI = 2, XV-2c/TaqI = 1). In
exon 7, a G to A transition at position 1172 causing the substitution of a histidine for an arginine
(R347H) was detected in a patient who carries the
deltaFS08 mutation on the other chromosome,
and has mild pulmonary disease and pancreatic sufficiency (PS). This mutation, which is associated
with haplotype C (KM. 19lPstI = 2, XV-ZdTaq
I = 2), affects the same nucleotide which is altered
in the R347P mutation (nucleotide change
G1172+C) described by Dean et al. (15). Both
mutations destroy an HhaI site, but can be distinguished since R347P also creates an NcoI site.
The second mutation detected in exon 7 is a missense mutation caused by a G to A transition at
position 1187 which generates an arginine to glutamine substitution (R352Q). This mutation creates a novel DdeI restriction site. T h e patient car-

rying this mutation, which is associated with
haplotype A (KM.l9/PstI= 1, XV-2c/TaqI= l ) ,
has PS and carries a still uncharacterized mutation
o n the other chromosome. In exon 12, a G to T
transversion at position 1885 causing the substitution of a stop codon for a glutamic acid (ESSSX)
was detected in four unrelated patients. This mutation is associated with haplotype B in three chromosomes and with haplotype A in the remaining
one. All four patients carry unknown mutations on
the other chromosomes. Of the three patients for
whom clinical information is available, two have
PI and one PS.
Finally an A to G transition in third position of
the splice donor site of intron 12 (1898 3A-G)
has been detected in a pancreatic sufficient patient
on a chromosome characterized by haplotype B.
Direct sequencing of eight additional samples
showing an altered electrophoretic behaviour allowed the identification of three G8SE mutations
in exon 3 (12), one I148T in exon 4 (F. Rininsland, D. Bozon, and L.-C. Tsui, personal communication), one G 178R in exon 5 ( 12), and one
1078delT (19) and two R347P (15) in exon 7. No
mutations were detected in exons 9, 21, 22, and 23
by DGGE analysis.
A series of control samples corresponding to a
total of 16 different known mutations located in
the same 9 exons were also screened by DGGE
(Table 2). Among these mutations, the only one
which could not be detected under the conditions
described in the present work is the N1303K mutation (13), since the control sample carrying this
mutation did not display a melting behaviour different from that of normal controls. To detect the
presence of this mutation in our samples, we carried out PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis
as described by Friedman et al. (20). A total of 11
chromosomes which were negative at the DGGE
analysis were shown by this method to carry the
N 1303K mutation.

DISCUSSION
The molecular diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is
hampered by the great number of mutations described in the CFTR gene, most of which occur
only in individual cases. This is particularly true in
Italy, where the deltaF508 mutation has a relatively low frequency (53.6%) compared to Northern European countries (21).
Moreover, among the numerous additional mutations reported so far and included in our previous
analysis (4,5), only 1717-1G-A (5.7% of total
CF chromosomes), GS42X (3.9%), and W1282X

NEW MUTATIONS OF THE CFTR GENE

(2.5%) have been detected in our population at a
frequency higher than 2%.
DGGE analysis using GC-clamped primers has
already been described as a reliable method to
identify DNA regions containing sequence variations which can be then characerized by direct sequencing (22). Combining these two techniques,
we screened a total of 2362 bp corresponding to 9
exons of the CFTR gene, coding for a large portion
of the two transmembrane (TM) and ATP-binding
domains of the CFTR protein, and including intron-exon boundaries. In total, four new mutations, corresponding to a nonsense, a frameshift,
and two missense mutations, and five known mutations were identified. In our experience, the mutations detected in these 9 exons and in the 6
additional exons already reported (4,5) screened
by DGGE and other methods account for about
85% of the total CF chromosomes in our patients.
The nonsense mutation E585X found in four
unrelated patients and the frameshift mutation
541delC found in two unrelated patients lead to a
premature termination of the protein product. Although it cannot be excluded that the patients
carry other mutations in the exons not yet examined, it is most likely that these two mutations are
the cause of CF in these patients.
The missense mutation R347H substitutes a histidine for an arginine residue in the first TM domain. This mutation has been found in a patient
who bears the deltaF508 mutation on the other
chromosome, has PS, and mild pulmonary disease.
The possibility that R347H is not a causative mutation cannot be excluded given the conservative
amino acid change. However, the mild phenotype
and the fact that no other mutation has been found
in the same patient in the 15 exons examined so
far still support the hypothesis of a role of this
mutation in the pathology of CF.
The second missense mutation (R352Q) substitutes a neutral (glutamine) for a basic (arginine)
residue. The patient bearing this mutation has PS
and carries an unknown mutation on the other
chromosome. It has been suggested by Kerem et al.
(1) that mutations causing CF can be classified as
severe or mild with respect to the residual pancreatic function, and that pancreatic sufficient patients carry at least one copy of a mild mutation.
The finding of these two missense mutations in
two pancreatic sufficient patients (one of whom
also carries the deltaF508 mutation which, in the
homozygous state, is generally associated with PI),
supports the association of missense mutations and
mild phenotype with respect to pancreatic func-

317

tion (23). Despite these considerations, the only
way to confirm at the DNA level the mutation
status of R347H and R352Q in these patients is to
extend search of mutations to the entire coding
region plus introdexon boundaries of the CFTR
gene.
Finally, an A to G transition (1898 3A-G)
in the third position of the splice donor site
(AAG/gtatgt) of intron 12 (24) was detected in a
pancreatic sufficient patient. N o other sequence
variation has been detected in the same patient in
the 15 exons examined so far. This nucleotide substitution was detected only once in 110 nondeltaF508 uncharacterized CF chromosomes, 58
deltaF508, 2 W1282X, 1 G542X, 1 R553X, and 48
normal chromosomes examined by DGGE analysis. Moreover, an A at position 1898+3 has always been observed in 12 normal, 5 deltaF508, and
29 non-deltaF508 CF chromosomes analysed by direct sequencing (J. Zielenski, personal communication). Nevertheless, since the general consensus
sequence for splice donor sites of different genes
has been reported as NNN/gt(a/g)agt (25), it is
possible that this nucleotide substitution represents
a rare neutral variant rather than a causative mutation. Analysis at the RNA level will show if this
nucleotide substitution can actually cause an aberrant splicing of intron 12.
It is of some interest that no mutations were
detected in our sample in exons 9, 22, and 23. In
these exons only a minor proportion of molecular
defects has been so far reported to the CF Genetic
Analysis Consortium; consequently, the absence
of molecular defects in these exons in our sample
could reflect the paucity of mutations in these regions of the gene. A n alternative explanation may
be that mutations or sequence variations in these
exons are not likely to disturb CFTR functions
enough to cause CF and consequently they would
not be found in a survey of CF patients; nevertheless, no sequence variations were detected in the
same exons in 48 normal chromosomes analysed.
Out of 16 different known mutations tested by
DGGE, only one (N1303K) did not give origin to
an altered electrophoretic behaviour under the experimental conditions presently described. This
mutation is a C to G transversion at position 4041,
and is the only nucleotide change of this kind examined in our study (Table 2): other nucleotide
substitutions (including one G to C and one T to
A) were all clearly evidenced by DGGE. The possibility of detecting a sequence variation in a DNA
fragment depends not only on the nucleotide substitution itself, but also o n the base composition of

the sequence surrounding it (26). However, it has
already been suggested that conservative transversions may not lead to an alteration of the melting
behaviour of the fragment being analysed, because
they do not change its nucleotide composition
(27). Nonetheless, the approach based o n GCclamped DGGE and direct sequencing represents a
valid strategy for mutation detection in genes such
as CFTR with a large number of different molecular defects.
