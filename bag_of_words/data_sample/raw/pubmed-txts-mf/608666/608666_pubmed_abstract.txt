The effects of the intraventricularly administered cations (Mn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Li+) against the seizure induced by ouabain (3 microgram) were investigated. Mn2+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ caused definite sedation and decreased locomotor activity. But Li+ was without significant behavioral effect at the doses applied. Among the cations used, Mn2+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ showed significant anticonvulsive effect on the ouabain-induced seizure. In comparison, on the dose and molar-to-molar basis, the potency of anticonvulsive action was in the following order: Mn2+ greater than Ca2+ greater than Mg2+. On the contrary, the higher dose of Li+ potentiated the ouabain-induced seizure. The importance of the increased Ca2+ level in the extracellular space or the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake as the anticonvulsive effect of Ca2+, Mn2+ and Mg2+ was discussed.
