Summary
Deficiency of P-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) activity typically results in Tay-Sachs disease. However, healthy
subjects found to be deficient in Hex A activity (i.e., pseudodeficient) by means of in vitro biochemical tests
have been described. We analyzed the HEXA gene of one pseudodeficient subject and identified both a
C739-to-T substitution that changes Arg247-Trp on one allele and a previously identified Tay-Sachs disease
mutation on the second allele. Six additional pseudodeficient subjects were found to have the C739-to-T
mutation. This allele accounted for 32% (20/62) of non-Jewish enzyme-defined Tay-Sachs disease carriers
but for none of 36 Jewish enzyme-defined carriers who did not have one of three known mutations common
to this group. The C739-to-T allele, together with a "true" Tay-Sachs disease allele, causes Hex A pseudodeficiency. Given both the large proportion of non-Jewish carriers with this allele and that standard biochemical
screening cannot differentiate between heterozygotes for the C739-to-T mutations and Tay-Sachs disease
carriers, DNA testing for this mutation in at-risk couples is essential. This could prevent unnecessary or
incorrect prenatal diagnoses.

Introduction

Tay-Sachs disease (GM2 gangliosidosis type I, reviewed
in Sandhoff et al. 1989) is a neurodegenerative disorder resulting from deficiency or defective function of
the a-subunit of l-hexosaminidase A (Hex A). There
are two major forms of 13-hexosaminidase, Hex A and
Hex B (Robinson and Stirling 1968). Hex A comprises
one a-subunit and one fi subunit, while Hex B comprises two D subunits (Geiger and Arnon 1976; Srivastava et al. 1976; Mahuran and Lowden 1980). The a
and 13 subunits are encoded by the HEXA and HEXB

genes, respectively (Proia and Soravia 1987; Neote et
al. 1988; Proia 1988). The assay of j-hexosaminidase
with a synthetic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-13-Nacetyl-glucosaminide (4-MUG), in combination with
a heat denaturation step, can be used to differentiate
the heat-stable Hex B from Hex A (Kaback 1972),
allowing Tay-Sachs disease heterozygotes, homozygotes, and noncarriers to be reliably differentiated.
Healthy subjects found to have deficiency of Hex A
activity when tested with standard synthetic substrates
have been described elsewhere (Vidgoff et al. 1973;
Kelly et al. 1976; O'Brien et al. 1978; Thomas et al.
1982; Grebner et al. 1986; Navon et al. 1986); they
have been called "pseudodeficient" or "Hex A minus"
normal. Most pseudodeficient subjects have been
identified through enzyme screening or during prenatal diagnosis. One such subject was also the mother
793

794

of a classical Tay-Sachs disease child (Vidgoff et al.
1973), suggesting that some of these subjects are compound heterozygotes of a Tay-Sachs disease allele and
a pseudodeficiency allele. This indicated that, despite
the biochemical defect associated with the pseudodeficiency allele, it must encode a protein with activity
toward the natural substrate, GM2 ganglioside, compatible with normal life. Unfortunately, carriers of
the pseudodeficiency alleles cannot be separated from
carriers of Tay-Sachs disease alleles by using routine
enzymatic methods (Vidgoffet al. 1973; O'Brien et al.
1978; Thomas et al. 1982; Grebner et al. 1986).
In North American non-Jews, the Tay-Sachs disease
carrier frequency of 1/300, estimated by HardyWeinberg analysis, is almost half the frequency,
1 / 167, determined by enzyme screening (Kaback et
al. 1978). This contrasts with the data for Ashkenazi
Jews, in whom the carrier frequency estimated from
the disease incidence, 1/30 (Myrianthopoulos and Aronson 1966), is consistent with the 1/31 frequency
found by enzyme screening (Petersen et al. 1983).
Greenberg and Kaback (1982) proposed that inconsistencies between the disease incidence and the enzyme-based carrier frequency in non-Jews could be
accounted for by a-subunit mutations that make individuals appear as Tay-Sachs disease heterozygotes on
the basis of standard biochemical tests, while they are
either (a) not at risk for having offspring with infantile
Tay-Sachs disease or (b) carriers of a Hex A minus
allele.
The Hex A from most individuals who are compound heterozygotes for a pseudodeficiency allele and
a Tay-Sachs allele have a characteristic biochemical
phenotype. The serum Hex A activity has been reported as 0%-15%, similar to that of a Tay-Sachs
disease child or a person with a variant form of TaySachs disease, while the leukocyte activity is 13%24%, just above the level in some adult-onset patients
but below the carrier range (Vidgoff et al. 1973; Kelly
et al. 1976; Thomas et al. 1982; Grebner et al. 1986;
Navon et al. 1986). Fibroblast levels vary 8%-26%
(Kelly et al. 1976; O'Brien et al. 1978; Thomas et al.
1982; Grebner et al. 1986; Navon et al. 1986) between Tay-Sachs disease heterozygotes and individuals with variant forms of the disease. In contrast, however, in vivo and in vitro assays with the natural
substrate of Hex A, i.e., GM2 ganglioside, give enzyme
activities in the low normal range (Kelly et al. 1976;
O'Brien et al. 1978; Thomas et al. 1982; Grebner et
al. 1986).

Triggs-Raine et al.
A large number of mutations responsible for TaySachs disease and its variants have been identified.
Three HEXA mutations account for most Tay-Sachs
disease and its variants in Ashkenazi Jews (Paw et al.
1990; Triggs-Raine et al. 1990; Grebner and Tomczak 1991; Landels et al. 1991), and more than 20
disease mutations have been identified in non-Jews
(Tanaka et al. 1990; reviewed in Akli et al. 1991;
Gravel et al. 1991; Paw et al. 1991; Triggs-Raine et
al. 1991). In the present study, a mutation associated
with Hex A pseudodeficiency in Ashkenazi Jewish and
non-Jewish individuals is described. We show that this
mutation accounts for a large proportion of nonJewish enzyme-defined carriers but that it does not
account for a significant proportion of Jewish enzyme-defined carriers.

Subjects and Methods
DNA Sources
Subject A (HSC 1107 [Hospital for Sick Children,
Toronto]), subject B (GM04863 [Human Genetic
Mutant Cell Repository, Camden, NJ], designated as
patient 1 by Grebner et al. [1986]), subject C (designated as patient 2 by Grebner et al. [1986]), subject D
(Bayleran et al. 1986), subject E (Navon et al. 1986),
subject F (designated as 11-2 by Kelly et al. [1976] and
as patient 2 by Thomas et al. [1982]), subject G (The
Kennedy Institute, Baltimore), and subject H (designated as patient 3 by Grebner et al. [1986]) were all
healthy individuals identified to be Hex A deficient by
means of the synthetic substrate, 4-MUG. DNA for
analysis was prepared (Hoar et al. 1984) from fibroblasts or leukocytes.
Leukocyte pellets or sonicates from enzyme-defined
carriers and noncarriers and from obligate carriers of
Tay-Sachs disease were from the California, Boston,
and Toronto Tay-Sachs Disease Prevention Programs.
Most of the carrier samples from Ashkenazi Jews that
were supplied by the Toronto and Boston progams
had formed the basis of a previous study on the distribution of Tay-Sachs disease alleles in Ashkenazi Jews
(Triggs-Raine et al. 1990). A sample was excluded
from the biochemically defined carriers if it was from a
person who was a biological relative of either another
enzyme-defined carrier or an obligate carrier. Obligate
carriers were defined as a biological parent of a fetus
or child with any form of Tay-Sachs disease. DNA
from two sibs with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was

provided by the Health Sciences Centre, Winnipeg.

Mutation Identification

Detection of C739-to-T Mutation

The three mutations common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population were analyzed according to a method
described elsewhere (Triggs-Raine et al. 1990). The
DNA was then screened for novel mutations after PCR
amplification of sequences flanking the 14 HEXA exons (Triggs-Raine et al. 1991). Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis (Orita et al.
1989) was done by means of a&2P-dATP-labeled PCR
products, with separation of the single- stranded DNA
by electrophoresis on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 10% glycerol. The PCR product
exhibiting a change in electrophoretic mobility was
phosphorylated and cloned into EcoRV-cut pBS +
(Stratagene, San Diego) by following standard procedures (Maniatis et al. 1982). Double-stranded DNA
was sequenced with Sequenase (United States Biochemicals, Cleveland).

DNA (0.1-0.5 jig) prepared from fibroblasts or leukocytes was amplified according to a method described elsewhere (Triggs-Raine et al. 1990), except
that the reaction cycle consisted of 32 cycles each of
which comprised 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 60°C, and
90 s at 720C. A 10-15-il aliquot was taken from
the PCR product, and 1 pl (2 units) of the restriction
enzyme NlaIII (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA)
was added. After a 2-h incubation at 370C the samples
were analyzed on 2.5% agarose gels.

Reverse Transcription of Total RNA, and cDNA Amplification
Total RNA was isolated (Chirgwin et al. 1979), and
25 gg, dissolved in 20 pd of water, was denatured at
650C for 5 min. Reverse transcription was done by
immediately placing the denatured sample on ice and
adding 80 units of RNasin (Promega Corporation,
Madison), 1 jl of oligonucleotide primer (0.5 gg of
dT15), 25 id of 2 x buffer (200 mM Tris-hydrochloride pH 8.0; 280 mM potassium chloride; 20 mM
magnesium chloride; 2 mM of dATP, dCTP, dGTP,
and dTTP; and 10 mM DTT), and 1 gd (3-5 units) of
AMV reverse transcriptase (Bethesda Research Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). The mixture was incubated at 420C for 1 h. The HEXA coding sequence
was amplified from the resulting cDNA in three overlapping fragments. To generate each fragment, a 5-l
aliquot of the synthesized cDNA was amplified, in a
standard PCR reaction mixture, with one of the following primer pairs (Triggs-Raine et al. 1990): exons
1-7, sense primer 5'CTCACCTGACCAGGGTCTC
ACGT-3' placed 5' of exon 1 and antisense primer
5'-AAGTGTGGCCAGGAGTGTCA-3' in exon 7;
exons 6-11, sense primer 5'-TGTCATGGCGTACAATAAAT-3' in exon 6 and antisense primer 5'-AGGGGTTCCACTACGTAGAA-3' in exon 11; and
exons 7-14, sense primer 5'-TACAACCCTGTCACCCACAT-3' in exon 7 and antisense primer 5'-CCTTTCTCTCCAAGCACAGG-3', 3' of exon 14. The
products were phosphorylated and subcloned into
EcoRV-cut pBS + for sequencing as described above.

Hexosaminidase Enzyme Assay

All assays using 4-MUG as the substrate were performed according to the manual heat-inactivation
methods described elsewhere (Lowden et al. 1976).
Assays using 4-MUGS (4-methyl-umbelliferyl-6-sulfo2-acetamido-2-deoxy-13-D-glucopyranoside; Toronto
Research Chemicals) were performed by the same
methods but without the heat-inactivation step.

Results

Identification of the Pseudodeficiency Mutation

During routine enzyme screening, subject A was
found to be deficient in Hex A activity. We tested
his DNA for the three known mutations common in
Ashkenazi Jews. The exon 12 splice-junction mutation (Arpaia et al. 1988; Myerowitz 1988; Ohno and
Suzuki 1988), an allele associated with the lethal infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease, was identified on
one chromosome (data not shown). The second allele
was detected by SSCP analysis. The exon 7 PCR product showed a band pattern distinct from that of the
normal sequence (fig. 1). It was cloned and sequenced
and revealed a single change, a C739-to-T transition
corresponding to an Arg247-to-Trp substitution (fig.
2). The remainder of the HEXA coding region of subject A was examined by reverse transcription of total
RNA and amplification of overlapping portions of the
cDNA. This was simplified because the other mutant
allele in subject A's DNA (exon 12 splice junction)
produces a reduced quantity of mRNA (Ohno and
Suzuki 1988). The amplified products were subcloned
and sequenced. The C739-to-T mutation was identified
in all three clones, amd no other changes were detected.

Detection of the Mutation

The C739-to-T mutation creates an NlaIII site, which
allowed for a strategy for the detection of this mutation, as outlined in figure 3. A region of exon 7 through
intron 8, including the region containing the mutation, was amplified and tested for the presence or absence of the NlaIII site. In addition, the forward primer
was synthesized with a single base mismatch to create
an independent NlaIII site (S'-CCTGTCACCCACATGTACACAGCA-3') to act as a control NMaII site to
assure that the restriction enzyme was active even if
the C739-to-T mutation was absent.

incidence of Tay-Sachs disease (Kelly et al. 1975). In
these cases, the C739-to-T mutation was independently
identified by direct sequencing of the exon 7 PCR amplification product. The second allele in subjects F and
G remains unidentified, although it is presumed to be
an infantile Tay-Sachs disease allele that is segregating
in this population. Subject H, a pseudodeficient subject whose hexosaminidase had biochemical properties different from those of the hexosaminidase of
other subjects (Grebner et al. 1986), did not have the
C739-to-T allele.

Enzyme Assay of a Pseudodeficient Subject

Serum and leukocyte samples from subject B and
from subject B's carrier mother and sib were assayed
with both the standard substrate 4-MUG and the
a-subunit-specific substrate 4-MUGS (tables 2 and 3).
The mother, a carrier of the C739-to-T mutation, had
Hex A levels just outside the carrier range, i.e., in the
"inconclusive" region. The sib of subject B, a carrier
of the exon 11 + TATC mutation, had Hex A levels
in the carrier range. Subject B, who has both of these
mutant alleles, had Hex A levels well below the carrier
range, similar to or slightly higher than those associ-

Screening for the C739-to-T Mutation in Tay-Sachs
Disease Carriers and Noncarriers

The samples initially screened for this mutation
from Ashkenazi Jews who had been biochemically screened as part of the regular Tay-Sachs disease
prevention programs in California, Boston, and Toronto. We thought that this mutation might account
for some of the enzyme-defined carriers who did not
have any of the other common mutations causing
Tay-Sachs disease in this population. As shown in table 4, none of the 36 Ashkenazi Jewish enzyme-defined
carriers previously shown not to have one of the three
mutations common in that population had the C739to-T mutation.
Samples from non-Jews who had also been enzymatically screened as part of the California and Boston
Tay-Sachs disease prevention programs, as well as
samples from non-Jewish obligate carriers of TaySachs disease, were analyzed for the C739-to-T mutation. It is significant that the mutation was found in
20/62 non-Jewish enzyme-defined carriers. Fifty-five
noncarriers and 33 obligate carriers of Tay-Sachs disease did not carry the mutation (table 4). Finally, the
mutation was identified in two middle-aged nonJewish sibs with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS) who had carrier (44% and 49%) Hex A activity.
An additional middle-aged sib, who did not have ALS,

also had carrier levels of enzyme activity. The nonJewish carriers with this allele had Hex A levels scattered throughout the carrier range and could not be
differentiated from true Tay-Sachs disease carriers by
means of standard methods. Most of the non-Jewish
individuals with the C739-to-T allele had some ancestral origin in western Europe, suggesting that this allele may have originated in this region.

a These 36 carriers did not have one of the three mutations common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population identified in a previous
study (Triggs-Raine et al. 1990).
b Seventeen of the obligate carriers are actually represented by 10
Tay-Sachs disease-affected offspring (3/20 alleles in the affected
offspring either were inherited from a parent of Ashkenazi Jewish
origin or were already represented by an obligate carrier, leaving 17

non-Jewish obligate alleles).

Tay-Sachs Pseudodeficiency Allele
Discussion
We found a C739-to-T (Arg247-to-Trp) mutation in
seven pseudodeficient subjects of either non-Jewish or
Jewish origin. In the five Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, who come from a population where the mutations
causing Tay-Sachs disease are largely known, the second allele was identified as one of the common TaySachs disease-causing alleles. This confirms earlier

hypotheses that pseudodeficient subjects would be
compound heterozygotes for a Tay-Sachs disease allele and a "pseudodeficiency" allele.
A characteristic enzyme phenotype is associated
with compound heterozygosity for the C739-to-T mutant allele and a Tay-Sachs disease allele. On the basis
of synthetic substrates, these individuals exhibit low
or absent serum Hex A activity, but the levels are
somewhat higher in fibroblasts and/or leukocytes
(Thomas et al. 1982; Grebner et al. 1986; Navon
et al. 1986; present study). Substantial levels of GM2
ganglioside hydrolysis in cultured cells from subjects
B, C, and F have been reported (Thomas et al. 1982;
Grebner et al. 1986). M. M. Kaback and K. Sandhoff
(unpublished data) found similar levels of enzyme activity in subject D by using an in vitro GM2 gangliosidase assay (489.7 pmol GM2 ganglioside degraded/h/
gg protein; normal range 384-787; adult-onsetdisease range 13-33). Therefore, the Arg247-to-Trp
change in the a-subunit does not appear to affect the
capacity of Hex A to hydrolyze the natural substrate.
Further, the a-subunit containing the Arg247-to-Trp
mutation appears to be made, processed, and secreted
normally from fibroblasts (Thomas et al. 1982;
Grebner et al. 1986). The reduced activity toward
4-MUGS compared with GM2 ganglioside was unexpected, since the two substrates have been shown to be
specific to the a-subunit (Kytzia and Sandhoff 1985).
Indeed, their different behavior toward Hex A in subjects with the pseudodeficiency allele suggests that the
mutated region of the protein may be involved in substrate recognition.
The C739-to-T mutation accounted for 32% of
enzyme-defined carriers among non-Jews. The high
prevalance of the allele in this population could explain the discrepancy between the enzyme-defined carrier frequency of 1 / 167 and the 1 / 300 frequency predicted by disease incidence. If the carriers of the
C739-to-T mutation are removed from the calculation,
then the carrier frequency becomes 1/250, which is
closer to that predicted. Since one pseudodeficient subject in our study did not have the C739-to-T mutation,

there may be additional alleles among non-Jewish carriers that do not cause disease.
The C739-to-T allele was not identified in any of the
Ashkenazi Jewish enzyme-defined carriers who were
previously analyzed and shown not to have any of the
three mutations common in this population (TriggsRaine et al. 1990). A larger study will be required to
establish the frequency of this allele within Ashkenazi
Jewish carriers.
Assessment of the clinical phenotype associated
with the C739-to-T mutation in pseudodeficient subjects is of crucial importance in providing a prognosis
for these individuals and others with the same genotype. Subject A was healthy when he was first tested
and still appears healthy at age 47 years, although no
formal neurological assessment has been done. Subject
E had a neurological assessment 4 years ago, at the
age of 35, and was found to be normal. Subject D
was healthy at the time of testing in her mid-30s and
remained so in the next decade, but no further update
is available. Subject F, now 56 years of age, similarly
reports no health problems. It is not yet possible to say
that compound heterozygotes carrying a Tay-Sachs
disease allele in combination with the pseudodeficiency allele will be disease free throughout their lives.
However, until more detailed neurological assessments can be made, especially in older subjects, we
would counsel that the C739-to-T allele appears to pose
little or no clinical risk.
The atypical Hex A activities associated with the
C739-to-T mutation also complicate prenatal diagnosis
when there is another disease-related allele, as was the
case for subjects B, C, and G. Prenatal diagnosis in
two cases was uncertain. With Hex A levels between
that of a Tay-Sachs disease homozygote and that of a
Tay-Sachs disease heterozygote (for subject B, 3.5%
in amniotic fluid and 25% in cultured amniotic fluid
cells; for subject C, 2% in amniotic fluid and 8% in
amniotic fluid cells; and, for subject G, 14%-21% in
cultured amniotic fluid cells), subjects C and G were
considered at risk for a variant form of Tay-Sachs
disease. DNA testing for the C739-to-T mutation
should prove to be a useful adjunct to enzyme procedures in distinguishing the allele from those causing
variant clinical forms of the disease.
We believe that testing for this allele should be available in programs for carrier testing for Tay-Sachs disease in both Ashkenazi Jews and non-Jews. In particular, the anxiety and expense associated with antenatal
diagnosis, as well as the difficulty in interpreting the

800

unusual enzyme levels, make it important to identify
the C739-to-T mutation in couples presumed to be at
risk. As we have shown in one instance, neither
4-MUG nor 4-MUGS could distinguish between a carrier of the C739-to-T allele and a carrier of a known
disease allele. This has been extended to a broader
survey of carriers (M. M. Kaback, unpublished data).
While the natural substrate assay would appear to be
an appropriate alternative, the instability of the radiolabeled natural substrate, the requirement for the biological activator protein, and the complexity of the
assay make it impractical. DNA testing is currently
the only simple method for identifying this allele.
