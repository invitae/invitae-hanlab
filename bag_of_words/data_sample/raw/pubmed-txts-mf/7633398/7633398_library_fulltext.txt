Received November 1, 1994; Revised and Accepted January 17, 1995

We have studied two different missense mutations at arginine-830 in exon 7 of the human androgen receptor
(hAR) gene that cause complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS) in three families. These substitutions result
from point mutations at nucleotide 2489: a G-»T transversion causes Arg830Leu and a G->A transition causes
Arg830Gln. Genital skin fibroblasts of the patients have negligible androgen-binding capacity. The mutations
were recreated in an hAR cDNA expression vector that was transiently transfected into COS-1 cells. Both
mutant androgen receptors have increased dissociation rate constants and apparent equilibrium rate constants
when measured with 5a-dihydrotestosterone or the synthetic, nonmetabolizable androgens, mibolerone or
methyltrienolone. The mutant androgen-binding activities share a distinctive thermal misbehavior. At 37°C
R830Q and R830L are about 40% and 10% of normal, respectively. At 22°C both mutants gain androgen
binding while the normal decreases by 20%; for R830Q the augmented value approaches 60% of the normal.
During prolonged 18 h incubation at 37°C, androgen binding of the normal AR is stable while that of both
mutants decreases by at least 85%. Both mutants have a very reduced ability to transactivate a cotransfected
androgen-responsive reporter gene, but R830Q is better than R830L. We conclude that arginine-830 is
important for A - R complex stability, and that its replacement by glutamine or leucine yields distinctive
functional aberrations. The importance of arginine at residue 830 in the hAR is reflected in the fact that it
occupies the homologous position in the hormone-binding domains of the receptors for progesterone,
glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid; furthermore, in the estrogen receptor it is conservatively replaced
by lysine.

INTRODUCTION
Normal male sexual development, including prenatal masculinization and pubertal virilization, is dependent on the androgen
receptor (AR) protein to mediate the effects of testosterone
and 5a-dihydrotestosterone (I). The AR is an androgenmodulated, DNA-binding protein that regulates the transcription of androgen target genes (2-4). Mutations in the AR gene
can cause defective, deficient, or absent androgen-binding
activity in 46,XY individuals, and result in various degrees of
the androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) (5): complete (CAIS) when external genitalia are phenotypically female; partial
(PAIS) when external genitalia are substantively ambiguous;

and mild (MAIS) when external genitalia are normal male or
nearly so. Subjects with CAIS have a feminine puberty except
for amenorrhea and sparse or absent sexual hair. Subjects with
MAIS have various degrees of pubertal undervirilization (with
or without infertility) and subjects with PAIS have mixtures
of pubertal feminization and virilization.
The human AR gene locus at Xql2 (6) spans >90 kb of
genomic DNA and is divided into eight exons (2). Like
other steroid receptors in its subfamily, the mineralocorticoid,
glucocorticoid, and progesterone receptors (7), the AR is
organized into three main structure—function units (2). Muta-

tional analysis of the human AR has revealed transcriptional
modulatory activity in the N-terminal region, encoded by exon
1 (4,8), and homology to other steroid receptors revealed
DNA-binding activity in the central region encoded by exons
2 and 3, and androgen-binding activities in the C-terminal
region encoded by exons 4 to 8 (2). Exon 1 is polymorphic
by virtue of length variation in its two long trinucleotide
repeats (9).
CAIS is most often attributable to point mutations in the
AR gene (10) causing amino acid substitutions (11-16),
aberrant splicing (17), or premature termination (14,18-20),
and much less often to gene deletions (21-23). Most frequently,
CAIS subjects have negligible androgen-binding capacity in
genital skin fibroblasts (GSF) (receptor-negative; R~; =£4 fmol/
mg protein, 37°C). In a minority of cases, binding capacity is
deficient (5-14 fmol/mg protein) (24) or normal (receptorpositive, R + ; 15-40 fmol/mg protein) (13,25,26), but binding
activity may be qualitatively abnormal.
Here we report the identification and characterization of a
single-nucleotide substitution at codon 830 (27) that causes
arginine to be replaced by leucine in two unrelated families
with CAIS. We also present additional characterization data
on a previously identified missense mutation of the same
codon (11; in this reference, codon 830 is numbered 831) that
encodes glutamine rather than arginine (Fig. 1).

androgen-binding domain (ABD) of the AR in subjects REL
and 2222, exons 4-8 were amplified by PCR and sequenced.
This revealed that both subjects had the identical missense
mutation in exon 7 changing nucleotide 2489 from G—>T,
ablating a BstBl site, and causing the amino acid substitution
of arginine by leucine (Fig. 2). Additional sequencing of exons
2 and 3 ruled out a mutation in the DNA-binding domain. We
also examined each of two trinucleotide repeats within exon

Transfection and transient expression studies
To confirm the pathogenicity of the G—>T transversion at
nucleotide 2489, and to distinguish between the residual
androgen-binding activities resulting from the alternative amino
acid substitutions at Arg83O, we recreated each mutation in
an AR cDNA expression plasmid and transfected normal or
mutant AR cDNA vectors into COS-1 cells. Figure 3 shows
that at 37°C, mibolerone (MB) binding of the R830Q and
R830L ARs are about 40 and 10% of normal, respectively. At
22°C, MB binding of both mutants increases, while that of
the normal decreases by about 20%. Thus, all three genotypes
are easily distinguished at 22°C and 37°C. Relative to their
respective activities at 37°C, the binding activities of the
normal AR and the R830Q AR decrease to about the same
extent at 4°C, while that of the R830L AR remains the same.
Essentially, this thermal behavior diminishes the difference
between the two mutants in MB-binding activity at 4°C.
Transfectants were exposed to MB at 22°C for 4 h to attain
maximal MB-binding capacity. When shifted to 37°C in the
presence of MB plus cycloheximide for 6 h, the R830Q AR
and the R830L AR lose 69 and 67% of their MB-binding
activity, respectively; normal receptors lose only 14% (Fig. 4).
In contrast, when the previously unliganded mutant ARs are
exposed to cycloheximide for 6 h (37°C), their MB-binding
activity is not more thermolabile than that of the normal AR
(?2 - 7 h).
Both mutant ARs exhibit increased non-equilibrium dissociation rate constants (k) with MB, methyltrienolone (MT), and
5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) at 37°C and with MT at 22°C
(Table 1). Apparent equilibrium dissociation rate constants
(Kd) for R830Q and R830L ARs are elevated for MT and MB
at 37°C (Fig. 5; Table 1) and at 22°C (Table 1). At low
concentrations of DHT, its binding was too low to yield
interpretable Scatchard plots.
Western blotting showed that the mutant ARs expressed in
COS-1 cells are of normal size (-110 kDa). There was no
visually detectable loss of full-size immunoreactive mutant
AR protein, or gain of AR fragments, despite a dramatic
decrease in concurrent MB binding during 18 h at 37°C (Fig.
6). Under the same conditions, less normal immunoreactive
AR gives higher MB binding, while immunoreactivity and
MB binding are at least constant, if not slightly increased,
during prolonged incubation.
In two cotransfection experiments where the cells were
exposed to various concentrations of MB for 72 h, the R830Q
AR was able to transactivate an androgen-responsive human
growth hormone reporter gene at a level appreciably higher
than that of the R830L AR: 16-31% of normal versus 1-8%,

respectively (Fig. 7). As predicted by the data in Figure 6, at
the end of these experiments there was no measurable specific
MB binding in the cells transfected with either mutant AR.

DISCUSSION
The mutations studied here replace arginine with glutamine or
leucine in a position of the AR that is strictly conserved among
members of the steroid receptor subfamily, including the
receptors for progesterone, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid. Moreover, the homologous position in the estrogen
receptor is occupied by another basic amino acid, lysine. The
significance of this observation is enhanced by the fact that
the estrogen receptor shares homology with the AR subfamily
in only one other of 13 surrounding positions.
The GSF of affected subjects from each of two independent
families with the R830L substitution and those of a subject
with the R830Q substitution have negligible androgen binding
at 37°C. However, the mutant ARs have sufficient androgen
binding for characterization after transient transfection with
the respective hAR cDNA expression vectors. Compared with
their respective androgen-binding activities during a standard
2 h assay at 37°C, the binding activities of the mutant ARs
increase at 22°C, while that of the normal AR decreases. The
augmented MB binding of the R830L and the R830Q ARs at
22°C versus 37°C suggests that the mutant ARs are able to
adopt a conformational state at the lower temperature that
favors an increased androgen-binding capacity. This shift in
the association-dissociation equilibrium at 22°C could reflect
an increased rate of androgen-receptor association, or a
decreased rate of androgen-receptor dissociation, or both.

However, the two types of mutant MB-receptor complexes
have comparable increased rates of dissociation both at 22°C
and 37°C. Therefore, it appears that replacement of Arg830
by glutamine or leucine alters the conformation of the mutant
ARs so as to permit them to augment their rates of association
with androgen at 22°C.
The mutant MB-receptor complexes formed during a 4 h
incubation with 3 nM [3H]MB at 22°C are more thermolabile
than normal during a subsequent 6 h incubation at 37°C; under
the same conditions, unbound mutant receptors are not more
thermolabile than normal (t\ ~7 h). Thus, the thermolability
of the mutant MB-receptor complexes is not attributable to
thermolability of unbound mutant receptors.
Western blotting revealed that only a normal-size AR is
expressed from the R830L and R830Q constructs in COS-1
cells. This indicates that the mutant ARs are not more susceptible than normal to proteolysis. It is noteworthy that both
mutants progressively lose most of their MB-binding activity
without a coordinate visual loss of AR immunoreactivity
during 18 h at 37°C. This suggests that MB binding is intially
vested in a small fraction of total immunoreactive AR, and
that prolonged incubation causes this fraction to adopt a nonbinding state progressively. Under the same conditions, the
normal MB-binding activity remains constant while immunoreactive protein remains stable or increases slightly densitometrically. Densitometric analysis of the mutant ARs was
complicated by the high levels of protein expression from the
increased amounts of plasmid transfected to obtain sufficient
binding activity for characterization.
The ability of both mutant ARs to transactivate an androgenresponsive reporter gene in cotransfection experiments is

when the GSF of the affected subjects are R . For example,
by this means, we have exposed a difference from normal in
thermal behavior of the androgen-binding activity of two
mutant ARs. This behavior probably reflects alternative conformations imposed on their ABDs because they have different
amino acids at a position usually occupied by arginine.
Differential products of AR digestion by proteases might
support the hypothesis of differential conformation between
the mutants and normal (32). Conservation of a basic amino
acid at the position homologous to Arg83O in the estrogen
receptor and in all members of the AR subfamily, is evidence
that this amino acid plays an important role in two overlapping
receptor functions: androgen-binding and transcriptional
activation. A study like this one is important in delineating
subtle structure—function relations of the androgen receptor.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Families
Subject REL has three affected maternal first cousins; their mother had
menarche at age 21. One maternal aunt and three maternal great-aunts of
subject 2222 are affected. The third subject, 31393, has two affected relatives,
as reported previously (12).
PCR amplification and direct sequencing of PCR product
Exons 1-8 were amplified and sequenced as described elsewhere (26).

markedly impaired, the R83OL AR being worse than its R830Q
partner. Thus, the transactivational competence of the R830Q
and R830L ARs correlates with their respective androgenbinding capacity at 37°C.
Aside from the two point mutations studied here, 12 others
have been reported in the ABD of the AR at different arginines
or as alternative substitutions at the same arginine residue;
three have yielded stop codons, one at codon 830 (14; where
codon 830 is numbered 831), and there have been substitutions
to histidine or cysteine three times, and to lysine, glutamine,
or glycine once each. Interestingly, eight of them occurred in
exon 7 (10), yet exon 7 contains less than 30% of all the
arginine residues in the ABD. Twelve of the 14 arginine
substitutions in the ABD involve G->A or C->T transitions.
This reflects the hypermutability of CpG dinucleotides by
methylation of cytosine and its deamination to thymine.
Previous studies of alternative amino acid substitutions at
given codons in the ABD have compared mutant ARs that
give receptor-deficient or R + GSF (13,26,29-31). The present
work illustrates how comparative analysis of mutant ARs
overexpressed in transfectants can reveal useful information

Site-directed mutagenesis
Each mutation was recreated within the hAR cDNA of a pSVARo expression
construct (2) using the overlap-extension method (34). Primary PCR fragments
were synthesized using primers R83OL-A (5'-GAACTTCTAATGAACTACATCAAG-3') or R830Q-A
(5'-GAACTTCAAATGAACTACATCAAG-3') and P3' (5'-CACCAACCTTCTGATAGGCAGC-3') in one
reaction; and R830L-B (3'-CTTGAAGATTACTTGATGTAGTTC-5') or
R830Q-B (3'-CTTGAAGTTTACTTGATGTAGTTC-5') and 30285-A
(5'-AATGAGTACCACATGCACAA-3') in another reaction. Primary PCR
reactions were conducted using Pfu (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or Vent
polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in the presence of 1 ng
pSVARo, 50 pmol primers A and B, 5mM dNTPs, for 35 cycles at 95°C for
1 min for denaturation, 50°C for 1 min for annealing and 72°C for I min for
extension. Primary PCR products were purified (35) for use in the secondary
PCR reactions which were conducted as described above, substituting 1/10
of the purified primary fragments for 1 |ig pSVAR0. The secondary fragments
and pSVARo were digested with EcoRl and BamHl, purified and ligated such
that the mutated fragments were substituted for the corresponding wild-type
fragments in the pSVARo expression vector. Transformation was done in XL1 Blue bacteria and resulting clones were sequenced between and beyond the
ligation sites to exclude extraneous point mutations. Large-scale plasmid
preparations were done using Qiagen columns (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA).
Transfections
COS-1 cells grown in OptiMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) were dislodged by trypsinization and resuspended in this
medium at a concentration of 20 million cells/ml before electroporation. For
some experiments (Figs 3 and 7), we transfected 10 million cells with 1-2
Hg of normal or mutant SVhAR plasmid. In other experiments, we used 1 \ig
of normal or 10 |ig of mutant SVhAR plasmid DNA, plus 2 ug of CMV-p"gal
[cytomegalovirus-P-galactosidase; to monitor transfection efficiency (36)] in
each 0.4 cm gap cuvette (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) and cells were shocked
at room temperature as described elsewhere (13). Replicate transfection
cuvettes were pooled and diluted to 0.3 million cells/ml, then I ml was added
to each 16 mm well of a 24-well plate.
Specific androgen binding
Forty-eight hours after transfection, we measured the level of specific androgen
binding and assessed various androgen-binding properties of the expressed
ARs (see below) by replacing the growth medium in replicate wells with a
serum-free assay medium containing stated concentrations of [3H] androgen
alone, or together with 200-fold radioinert (nonradioactive) androgen at
various temperatures for stated periods. The assay medium (pH 7.4) is Eagle's

The androgens used were: [1,2,4,5,6,7 -3H]5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT; 130

detection system (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL). To control for equal
protein loading, a primary antibody directed against a-tubulin (Amersham,
Oakville, ON) was used. Densitometry was performed on an LKB Ultroscan
XL densitometer (LKB, Rockville, MD) using the Gel Scan XL Program
(Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ).

Measurement of B max and Kd

This work was supported by grants from the Medical Research Council of
Canada, the Fonds de la Recherche en Same du Quebec, and the N1H
(DK43147; TRB). Subject 2222 and her family were referred by John Graham,
MD formerly of the Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH, USA.

Cells in groups of six wells were incubated in quadruplicate for 2 h (37°C)
or 4 h (22°C) with various concentrations of [3H] androgen alone (total
binding), and duplicate wells were incubated together with 200-fold radioinert
androgen (nonspecific binding). After subtraction of nonspecific from total
binding, the B ^ , and K^ of specific binding were derived from Scatchard
plots as described previously (38).
Dissociation of androgen-receptor complexes
Cells in groups of six wells were incubated in quadruplicate for 1-2 h at
37°C with 3 nM [3H] androgen alone, and duplicate wells were incubated
together with 0.6 mM radioinert androgen. Specific androgen binding was
measured, the labeling medium in all wells was replaced by a chase medium
containing only 200-fold radioinert androgen, and the cells were incubated at
37 or 22°C. The cells were harvested 30, 60, 90 and 120 min later, and
percent remaining specific androgen binding was plotted semilogarithmically
against time. We have ascertained that the normal and mutant ARs are stable
during the interval of the chase.
Thermostability of androgen-receptor complexes
Cells in groups of six wells were incubated in quadruplicate with 3 nM [3H]
MB alone, and duplicate wells were incubated together with 200-fold radioinert
MB at 22°C for 4 h. Specific androgen binding was determined ('0 time')
from one cohort of six wells. The media in the remaining wells were
supplemented with 100 U.M cycloheximide, and the plates were transferred to
a 37°C incubator. Two, 4 and 6 h later, we measured the percent specific MB
binding remaining.
Thermolability of free androgen receptors
Specific MB binding at 37°C ('basal') was measured in cells not exposed to
cycloheximide. Replicate monolayers were incubated in assay medium with
100 flM cycloheximide at 37°C for 2, 4 or 6 h, and then were post-incubated
(37°C) for 1 h with [3H]MB alone, or together with 0.6 nM radioinert MB,
to measure specific MB binding. The percent of basal MB binding remaining
was plotted semilogarithmically against time.
Transactivational competence of the ARs
As described in detail previously (13), we cotransfected 10 million cells with
1 (ig of normal or mutant SVhAR plasmid and 20 ng of a reporter plasmid
consisting of a human growth human (hGH) gene linked to the several AREs
(30) in the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus
(MMTV). Four hours later we added various concentrations of [3H]MB to
the medium, and 72 h later we assayed hGH secreted into the medium using
the Allegro Human Growth Hormone Kit (Nichols Institute, San Juan
Capistrano, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Western analysis
Confluent monolayers of transfected COS-1 cells (-1 million cells) in 35 mm
dishes were washed twice on ice and once at room temperature for 7 min
with 0.02 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Cells were scraped from the plates and pooled
in duplicate and microfuged briefly to pellet the cells. Lysis buffer (170 ml;
60 mM Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, 100 mM DTT, 20% glycerol) containing 10 mg/
ml of the protease inhibitors E-64, Aprotinin, Bestatin, Leupeptin, Pepstatin,
APMSF (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) was added, and the lysis mix was passed
through a 26G needle five times. Samples were boiled (10 min) and cellular
debris was pelleted at 10 000 r.p.m. for 5 min. Three p.1 were used for a
protein assay (36) with the Bio-Rad DC reagents (Bio-Rad, Hercules CA).
Protein (100 mg) was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and Western transfer by electroblotting according to the method
of Ausubel et al. (39). Nitrocellulose filters were blocked for 1 h in TBS [20
mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 500 mM NaCl] plus 0.5% Tween-20 at 27°C.
Filters were then incubated with monoclonal antibody [F39.4.1, directed
against a peptide (Sf61) corresponding to amino acids 301-320 in the Nterminus of the hAR (2)] and washed at 27°C as described previously (13).
Blots were developed using the ECL Western blotting chemiluminescence
