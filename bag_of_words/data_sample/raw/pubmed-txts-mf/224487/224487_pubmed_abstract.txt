A new case of portal hypertension associated with hepatic sarcoïdosis is reported. The authors reviewed 23 other cases in the literature, they underline diagnostic difficulties of which the etiology remains unclear. Surgical treatment seems to be the best in comparison with corticotherapy. Postoperative encephalopathy may appear till 8 years postoperatively. Hepatic atrophy rather than sarcoïdosis must be responsible for it.
