We have applied single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) to the analysis of exon 7 of the
anticoagulant protein C (PC) gene, in 13 PC-deficient Spanish families. Abnormal patterns were
visualized in three samples from type I or quantitative PC deficient proposita. A previously undescribed
mutation due to a TT insertion after nucleotide 6139, between codons Gly-142 and Arg-143 was
found in one family. T h e mutation (6139,ins TT) should result in a frameshift with a stop at codon
156, which agrees with the presence of a type I or quantitative PC deficiency in the affected members
of the family. T h e second mutation identified was a C to T transition at nucleotide 6274, 9 base pairs
into intron G. This mutation (6274,C+T), found for the first time in a Spanish family, is identical to
the previously characterized PC Sant Louis. T h e third mutation was a G to A transition that replaces
arginine 1 7 8 with glutamine (178,R-Q). This is the third case of 178,R-Q mutation in 17 apparently unrelated Spanish families with type I PC deficiency. Furthermore, SSCP analysis allowed the
detection of another previously described mutation in a PC-deficient Spanish family (178,R-W).

INTRODUCTION

Protein C (PC) is the vitamin K-dependent
plasma zymogen of a serine protease that regulates
blood coagulation by inactivating the procoagulant
cofactors Va and VIIIa (Clouse and Comp, 1986;
Greengard and Griffin, 1988). The physiological
importance of the PC anticogulant pathway is illustrated by the relationship existing between hereditary PC deficiency and thromboembolic disease (Bovill et al., 1989).
The human protein C gene consists of 9 exons,
spanning about 11 kb of DNA on chromosome 2
(Foster et al., 1985; Plutzky et al., 1986; Rocchi et
al., 1986). In a previous study (Sala et al., 1991)
we found that three out of five unrelated type I or
quantitative PC-deficient Spanish families had a
mutation in exon 7 of the PC gene, affecting the
codon for arginine 178. In two cases this arginine
was replaced by glutamine (178,R-+Q), while in
the third case it was replaced by tryptophan
(178 ,R-+W) .

In order to study the presence of the 178,R+Q
and 178,R-+W mutations in a further 13 PC-deficient Spanish familes, we developed conditions
for single strand conformation polymorphism
(SSCP) analysis of exon 7 of the PC gene. We
report here the identification of a novel frameshift
mutation in one patient, a further case of
178,R+Q mutation, and one case of the previously identified PC Sant Louis I (6274,C-tT)
(Tsuda et al., 1991).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein C-Deficient Families

Exon 7 of the PC gene has been analysed in the
proposita of 13 Spanish families with hereditary
P C deficiency (families PC7 to PC16 and PC18 to
PC20). In all cases except one (PCZO), patients

94, 61, and 74°C for 30, 30, and 45 sec, respectively, were performed. Amplified samples were diluted 1/50 in distilled water and 1/2 in stop solution containing 10 mM NaOH and 6 pl of each
dilution were loaded in a 6% acrylamide gel containing 5% glycerol in TBE. Electrophoresis was
performed at 10 W for 24 hr a t room temperature.
DNA SEQUENCING

DNA sequencing of PCR amplified fragments,
purified according to Reitsma et al. (1991), was
performed in an Applied Biosystems 370A DNA
sequencer (Chill6n et al., 1992), using PC711 or
PC7 12 primers.

amidolytic (Coamate protein C, KabiVitrum,
Stockholm, Sweden) and anticoagulant (Protein

I1 or qualitative PC deficiency, with normal levels
of PC antigen but reduced PC amidolytic and anticoagulant activities.

RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the results of SSCP analysis of
exon 7 of the PC gene of the proposita of the
studied families. Abnormal bands, different from
those of control samples for normal exon 7 (lanes
2, 3, and 5), were seen for the previously characterized 178,R-+W mutation (lanes 1.1 and 1.2,
Fig. IA), as well as in lanes 9 and 19, corresponding to patients from families PC9 and PC19, with
unknown mutations. In lanes 4 (178,R-Q mutation) and 15 a very faint band was detected. Further analysis of PC6 (also known to have the
178,R+Q mutation) and PC15 confirmed the
presence of a similar abnormal band in both families (Fig. 1B).
Sequencing of the PCR amplified exon 7 of
PC9, PC15, and PC19 showed that PC15 was heterozygous for a new case of 178,R-+Q mutation
due to a G to A transition at nucleotide 6246 of
the PC gene, according to the numbering of Foster
et al. (1985) (Fig. 2a). PC19 was found to be het.
erozygous for a C to T transition at nucleotide
6274, 9 base pairs into intron G (Fig. 2b). This
mutation (6274,C-+T), identical to the one previously described as PC Sant Louis I (Tsuda et al.,
1991), creates an alternative splice junction which
results in a frameshift with a stop, 30 codons into
exon 8. The presence of this mutation in patient
PC19 was furthermore confirmed by restriction
analysis with HphI of PCR amplified exon 7 (results not shown).
DNA sequencing of the excised abnormal band
from the propositus of PC9 in the SSCP gel
showed the presence of a TT insertion between
nucleotides 6139,G and 6140,A, corresponding to
codons Gly- 142 and Arg- 143, respectively (Fig.
2c, SSCP band). The same insertion in the heterozygous state was seen after sequencing of the
amplified exon 7 from genomic DNA of the pa-

tient (Fig. 2c, PC9). This mutation (6139,ins TT)
should result in a frameshift with a stop at codon
156 and eliminates a restriction site for MnlI. Further SSCP analysis of exon 7 from PC9 family
members, as well as restriction analysis with MnlI,
indicated the presence of the TT insertion in the
sister and nephew of the propositus, both classified
as PC deficient (results not shown). The wife and
daughter of the propositus, with normal PC levels,
were also normal for exon 7.

We have used SSCP to analyse exon 7 of the PC
gene of 13 PC-deficient Spanish families and found
three different mutations related to type I or quanp
titative PC deficiency. One of them is a new case
of 1 7 8 , R j Q mutation, which is the third among
17 apparently unrelated type I PC-deficient Spanish families. The second, 6274,C+T, 9 bp into
intron G, was found to be the same as PC Sant
Louis (Tsuda e t al., 1991). The other mutation
identified was a previously undescribed frameshift
mutation due to a double T insertion between
codons Gly-142 and Arg-143 (6139,ins TT mutation). Cosegregation of this mutation with PC deficiency in family members has been shown by
SSCP and restriction analysis.
The three mutations identified here were found
in the heterozygous state in proposita who had suffered at least one episode of venous thrombosis. In
family PC9, with the 6139,ins TT mutation, there
is a clear history of recurrent venous thromboembolism in the propositus and his mother, while his
affected sister and nephew remain asymptomatic.
Affected patients with any of these three mutations had already been diagnosed as heterozygous
for a type I PC deficiency, due to the presence in
their plasma of similarly reduced PC antigen and
activity levels of around 50%. The relationship
between type I PC deficiency and the 178,R-+Q
and 6274,C+T mutations has already been found
by other authors (Grundy et al., 1991; Gandrille et

EXON 7 PROTEIN C GENE MUTATIONS IN SPANISH FAMILIES

al., 1991; Tsuda et al., 1991). As far as we know,
the 6139,ins TT mutation found in family PC9 is
the first case described of an insertion in the PC
gene causing PC deficiency. In this case the presence of a type I PC deficiency is explained by the
fact that this insertion should result in a frameshift
and a termination codon for the protein C synthesis.
