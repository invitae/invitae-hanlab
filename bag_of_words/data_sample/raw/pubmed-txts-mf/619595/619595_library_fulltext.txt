A man, presumed to have died with heart block,
had married three wives who, in four generations,
engendered more than 260 members. Of the 209
family members examined, 32 showed obvious
abnormalities of the conducting system. Twelve
showed complete right bundle branch block
(RBBB), seven exhibited incomplete RBBB, six
had right bundle branch block with left axis
deviation, four showed RBBB with right axis
deviation, one had left axis deviation alone, and
two exhibited complete heart block. The pedigree
pattern is compatible with the autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The onset, likely
congenital, and the course of the disorder are
discussed.
It is now well established that, in many
instances, disorders of the conducting system
show a hereditary distribution. Since our first two
reports on a Lebanese family,‘, 2 several examples
have been described where various forms and
degrees of block occurred in a parent and offspring, or in two or more generations.3-‘3 An autosomal dominant defect of the conducting system
has been suggested.
The present family is rather unique in that it
descends from a man who married three wives
who engendered more than 260 members in four
generations. Impairment
of the intraventricular conduction, predominantly the right, had
been documented in many individuals through
three and four successive generations, suggesting
a hereditary
defect of the bundle branch
system.

The

proband

This 76-year-old
man complained
in March,
1974, of dizziness. Examination
disclosed
diabetes,
and evidence
of right
bundle branch block with left axis deviation.
Chest x-ray films
were normal.
During
the following
two years he was symptom-free,
with no changes
in the electrocardiograms.
In
February,
1976, he fainted
for the first time and was then
found to present an intermittent
complete
heart block with an
atria1 rate of 30 to 90 a minute, a ventricular
rate of 34 to 36 a
minute,
and QRS complexes
similar to those seen when the
patient
was in sinus rhythm.
A pervenous
pacemaker
was
successfully
inserted.
When
we realized
that
a halt-brother
of the proband
presented
complete
heart block, we decided to investigate
all
available
members
of the family.

Family

members

The proband
was the eldest son of a man who married
three
wives with whom he had had 16 children.
This man was known
to suffer from heart disease with fainting
attacks.
He died
suddenly,
at an advanced
age, some 30 years ago. Numerous
stillbirths
and early deaths occurred
in the second and third
generations.
Some members had emigrated
to Africa. Therfore
we could only represent
in the pedigree individuals
known to
be alive in 1976. These numbered
about 260, all progeny
of the
common
progenitor.
Only two marriages
of first cousins in the third and fourth
generations
were known.
All others were non-consanguineous,
including’
the three progenitor
unions.

Method
Personal contact was established
with all members
living in
Lebanon.
The aim of the survey was explained
to all responsible persons.
Excellent
cooperation
was always
obtained.
Several
family
branches
could not be entirely
covered,
as
approach
to certain remote villages in the south of the country
was not always safe during the Lebanese
civil war. However,
a total
number
of 209 family
members
could
be examined.
The survey included
a clinical examination,
with a 12-lead
electrocardiogram,
and additional
right precordial
leads, V,,
and V,,, when it was necessary.
Due to a shortage
of x-ray
films, only 18 affected persons could have a chest roentgenogram. We also had to examine
26 partners
of married
members
of the family, including
the proband’s
wife, and partners
of her

Of the 209 family
members
examined,
32 showed obvious
electrocardiographic
abnormalities
related
to the conducting
system.
They
were represented
by symbols
in the family pedigree
(Fig. l), and are listed in Table
I. They
included:
Complete heart block: Two cases: the proband
and his halfbrother,
B-11-3*.
This case B-ZZ-3, a healthy
man 41 years old, experienced
exertional
dizziness
4 to 5 times during
the last 3 years.
Repeated
electrocardiograms
showed
complete
heart
block
with an atria1 rate of 70 to 85 a minute, a ventricular
rate of 35
to 38 a minute, and wide QRS complexes
not unlike those seen
in left bundle
branch
block. General
examination,
routine
laboratory
analysis, and chest x-rays,
were normal.
Insertion
of a pervenous
pacemaker
was not accepted.
Right bundle-branch
block (RBBB):
Criteria
proposed
by
the New York Heart Association
(1966) for this diagnosis were
applied.
However,
in infants
and young
children,
a shorter
QRS duration,
from 0.08 to 0.10 sec., was accepted
provided
the right ventricular
activation
time was prolonged.
Values of
at least 0.06 sec. were adopted
by us for the diagnosis
of
complete
RBBB,
and of 0.04 to 0.06 sec. for incomplete
RBBB.

2nd degree: Incomplete
RBBB:
Seven cases. Average age 16
years (range 8 months to 38 years).
RBBB with left axis deviation
(LAD) (frontal
plane axis of
the initial 0.04 portion
of the QRS): Six cases. Average
age 30
(range 2 to 55 years). Five of these cases showed axes of -30”
to -75”. The sixth case, A-11-25*, a 3-year-old
boy, showed an
axis of about -5’.
RBBB with right axis deviation
(RAD) frontal
plane axis of
the initial 0.04 portion of the QRS): Four cases. Average
age 16
years (range 22 days to 37 years).
These cases were three
males, A-IV-2,
A-IV-16,
and A-IV-22,
aged 37,14, arid 14, years,
respectively,
with axes of + 90” to + loo”, and a 22-day-old
baby girl, A-IV-27,
with an axis of + 150’ (Fig. 4).
Left axis deviation
(LAD):
One case: a man of 72 years, with
an axis of -75”.
Figs. 2 and 3 are examples
of eight cases of RBBB
of
different
ages and from each generation.
Fig. 4 shows the
electrocardiogram
of the 22-day-old
baby girl, A-IV-27,
who,
to the best of our knowledge,
is the youngest
case of RBBB
ever observed
in an otherwise
normal subject.
There was no instance
of prolongation
of the PR interval.
Sinus bradycardia
was not encountered.
There were several borderline
cases with an rr’s or rsr’s’
configuration
in the right precordial
leads, without
definite
prolongation
of the QRS (Fig. 6). A few other cases showed
mild degrees
of left axis deviation.
We also encountered
several instances
of the Sl S2 S3 syndrome.
All these cases,
being ill-defined
or equivocal,
were not retained
in the present
series. We also discarded four young cases with deep q and tall
R waves in left precordial
leads, because technical
facilities
to
rule out cardiomyopathy
and congenital
cardiac lesion were
not available.

marriages
in the third and fourth
generations resulted

According
to the family,
early deaths were
mainly due to common diseases of infancy

Comment

Impairment of conduction in the right branch
of His bundle is an almost constant feature of the
affection in this family. The anterior division of
the left branch, as indicated by left axis deviation,
also seemsto be involved in several cases.Impairment of the posterior division is doubtful, as right
axis deviation in babies and young thin subjects
can be normal. Development of complete heart
block, as it occurred in the proband case, could
represent total impairment of the two branches,
or the right branch and the two divisions of the
left. The same development could be incriminated in subject B-11-3, though heart block in this
case may already have been complete from the
onset of the defect.

findings, not included in the series, some of them
may correspond to minor forms of interventricular block, especially when encountered in
offspring of affected individuals, and more particularly in parents of affected children. They will be
discussed in a subsequent paper.
The pedigree pattern (Fig. l), with affected
individuals, males and females, through successive generations, and in the absence of consanguinity, is compatible with the autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The trait obviously had
been transmitted by the common progenitor to
five children from two of his three wives, and
down to the fourth and fifth generation in several
unbroken lines. Other lineages showed skipped
generations. The proband’s first brother, A-11-3, is
affected with left anterior hemiblock. None of his
seven examined children were affected. Then
RBBB recurred in one grandson, A-IV-88, after
one skipped generation, and in three great-grand-

The 33 per cent incidence probably is below the
actual one, since borderline cases have not been
included. However, the expected ratio, one to one,
in an inherited dominant trait is closely obtained
.
in the generation of the proband and his progeny,
with 22 affected persons to 24 non-affected individuals.
The low female incidence, though not significant, may correspond to a relatively low expressivity in females. Scrutiny of the pedigree shows,
indeed, eight instances where affected children
are born to non-affected parents, of whom five
are females: A-111-8, A-111-16, A-IV-g, A-IV-77
and A-111-14; and three males: A-11-6, A-111-3,
and A-N-5.
Distribution
according to age (Fig. 5) shows a
high number of affected individuals in the young
age groups, with six affected to four non-affected
individuals between 0 and 2.5 years of age. There
is no homogeneity in ages in the different genera-

tions, with the exception of the fifth, where there
are seven affected persons to nine non-affected
individuals, with an average age of two years for
the affected ones. Evidently, this is an early, if not
congenital onset.
It has been customary to separate familial
congenital block from block of late or adult onset,
according to the age at which the disorder has
been detected. We now recommend that no case
should be considered of late or adult onset unless
documented by previous normal ECGs.
Right bundle branch block associated with left
anterior or posterior hemiblock is a more severe
disorder than right bundle branch block alone.
Both probably correspond to different degrees in
the expressivity of the genetic defect, since they
are encountered in the same family branches, in
aged as well as in young persons. One can assume
that both types of block had been manifest at the
same time, unless proved by serial electrocardiograms.
At the age of 76 years, the proband advanced
from right bundle branch block with left anterior
hemiblock to intermittent complete heart block.
Progress from lesser to more advanced forms and
degrees of block had been observed many times;
the subject has been well reviewed.? James’” looks

tion.” In our series, the bundle branch system is
already affected with one or two impaired pathways. Our cases, from the beginning, are in the
precursor stages of heart block. Theoretically, we
could presume that the conducting system, in our
cases, is more vulnerable to the effect of extraneous agents, such as infection, stretching, and
especially, deficiency in blood supply. These
agents may, at any time, provoke further damage
and so precipitate heart block. However, there are
casesof heart block from birth.’ These casesmay
represent a severe degree in the expressivity of the
genetic defect.
There was no clinical evidence to relate the
conducting system disorder in this family to other
familial or cardiovascular disease. Two recent
studie9, I7 demonstrated in two casesof familial
heart block pathology of the distal portion of His
bundle and the proximal portions of the two
branches. In James’ caseI of a 26-day-old baby,
pathology consisted of severe caseous degeneration of these portions.
Without
His bundle recordings, it is not
possible to indicate the site of the defect, whether
it is at the level of His bundle or below. Clinically,
we know that the defect had impaired the bundle
branch system, predominantly the right bundle
branch.

bundle branch disease. The evolution in the
