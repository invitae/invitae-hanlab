Summary
A generalized deficiency of the mitochondrial matrix enzyme ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) is the inborn
error in gyrate atrophy (GA), an autosomal recessive degenerative disease of the retina and choroid of the
eye. Mutations in the OAT gene show a high degree of molecular heterogeneity in GA, reflecting the genetic
heterogeneity in this disease. Using the combined techniques of PCR, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct sequencing, we have identified three nonsense-codon mutations and one nonsense codongenerating mutation of the OAT gene in GA pedigrees. Three of them are single-base substitutions, and
one is a 2-bp deletion resulting in a reading frameshift. A nonsense codon created at position 79 (TGA) by
a frameshift and nonsense mutations at codons 209 (TAT--TAA) and 299 (TAC-'oTAG) result in abnormally low levels of OAT mRNA in the patient's skin fibroblasts. A nonsense mutation at codon 426
(CGA-"TGA) in the last exon, however, has little effect on the mRNA level. Thus, the mRNA level can
be reduced by nonsense-codon mutations, but the position of the mutation may be important, with earlier
premature-translation termination having a greater effect than a later mutation.

Introduction

Gyrate atrophy (GA) of the choroid and retina is an
autosomal recessive eye disorder involving a progressive loss of vision due to severe chorioretinal degeneration (Valle and Simell 1989). The underlying biochemical defect in GA is in the mitochondrial matrix
enzyme, ornithine aminotransferase (OAT). The defect is systemic and leads to hyperornithinemia. The
mechanism by which the OAT deficiency and hyperornithinemia lead to the chorioretinal degeneration,
however, is not known.
A variety of OAT mutations have been reported in

GA patients, by our group and others (Inana et al.
1988, 1989; Mitchell et al. 1988, 1989b; Ramesh et
al. 1988; McClatchey et al. 1990; Akaki et al. in
press), demonstrating a high degree of molecular heterogeneity in this disease. In view of this, a rapid and
efficient method of detection of mutations would be
useful for the study of GA. Such a method is a combination of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
(DGGE) and direct sequencing of PCR-amplified
(Saiki et al. 1985) gene sequences. DGGE is a gel system developed by Fischer and Lerman (1983) that separates DNA fragments according to their sequencespecific melting properties and that is capable of
resolving DNA fragments differing by as little as a
single base. Attachment of a GC-rich region (GC
clamp) to PCR-amplified genomic DNA fragments has
improved the resolution of DNA fragments shown,
by DGGE, as containing a single-base substitution
(Sheffield et al. 1989). Using these techniques, we have
identified three nonsense-codon mutations and one

nonsense codon-generating mutation of the OAT
gene in GA pedigrees. Three nonsense mutations are
due to single-base substitutions in codons 209, 299,
and 426, and one (codon 79) is caused by a 2-bp deletion at codons 64 and 65, resulting in a reading
frameshift. The nonsense-codon mutations result in
a variable decrease in the level of steady-state OAT
mRNA, with the earlier premature terminations in
the coding sequence appearing to have a greater effect
than the later ones.
Subjects and Methods
Subjects
Patient 1. - This patient was diagnosed, at the age of
23 years, as having GA. Retinal findings were characteristic, as was the elevation of plasma ornithine. No
change in plasma ornithine was noted on pyridoxine
therapy. OAT activity was not detectable in cell extracts from skin fibroblasts. The patient was adopted
at birth in Canada, and no family information was
available.
Patient 2.-The clinical characteristics of this patient
have been described elsewhere (patient 4 of Weleber
et al. [1982] and Kennaway et al. [1989]; also see fig.
12-5 in Weleber and Kennaway 1988). OAT activity
was not detectable in cell extracts from skin fibroblasts. Southern blot analysis and northern blot analysis of this patient and his family have been reported
elsewhere (Inana et al. 1988; Hotta et al. 1989). This
patient has a partial heterozygous deletion of 1,072
bp, including exon 6, of the functional OAT gene
(Akaki et al., in press). Northern blot analysis revealed
no detectable OAT mRNA. The patient is of English,
Dutch, German, and French ancestry.
Patient 3.-This 19-year old male of English and
German ancestry had the GA diagnosis made at 19
years of age. Night vision had been poor since early
childhood. With - 8.00 + 0.50 axis 1250 he saw
20/ 80± , J3 at near, right eye, and with - 4.00 sphere
he saw 20/300, J12 at near, left eye. He had normal
color vision in the right eye and a moderate color
deficiency in the left eye, midperipheral scotomas between 100 and 300 from fixation, and, on Goldmann
perimetry, marked decrease of solid angles of peripheral kinetic visual fields (Weleber and Tobler 1986)
(IV4e test Isopter was 1.41 steradian [right] and 1.36
steradian [left] [normal 3.59 ± 0.25], and I4e test
Isopter was 0.274 steradian [right] and 0.077 steradian [left] [normal 2.621 + 0.266]). His examination

showed moderately advanced posterior subcapsular
cataracts bilaterally, typical total vascular atrophy of
the peripheral choroid and retina, and a nonaveraged
Ganzfeld electroretinogram that was undetectable
above noise (<10 gV). Serum ornithine level before
treatment with vitamin B6 was 912 ± 21 iimol/liter
and, after treatment with 300 mg/d, was 903 and
912 pmol/liter (normal 83 ± 30 gmol/liter). OAT
activity was not detectable in extracts from skin fibroblasts.
Patient 4.-The clinical characteristics of this patient
have been described elsewhere (fig. 12-1 of Weleber
and Kennaway 1988). OAT activity was 10 ± 3
nmol/mg protein/h (normal 276 ± 111) in cell extracts from skin fibroblasts (patient 8 of Kennaway et
al. 1989). The patient is of Italian, Dutch, and Irish
ancestry.
Patient 5.- The clinical characteristics of this patient
have been described elsewhere (patient 2 of Hayasaka
et al. 1981). OAT activity was not detectable in cell
extracts from skin fibroblasts. The patient is Japanese.
None of the five patients was responsive to vitamin B6
therapy.

Southeem Blot Analysis
High-molecular-weight DNA was isolated from the
patients' skin fibroblasts according to the method of
Blin and Stafford (1976). The DNA was digested with
several restriction enzymes, electrophoresed on 0.8%
agarose gel, transferred onto nylon membrane, hybridized with the human OAT cDNA, washed, and
autoradiographed, as described by Inana et al. (1988).
Northem Blot Analysis

Total RNA was isolated from the patient skin fibroblasts by the guanidine thiocyanate method (Chirgwin et al. 1979), electrophoresed on 0.8% denaturing
agarose gel, transferred onto nylon membrane, hybridized with the human OAT cDNA or actin cDNA,
washed, and autoradiographed, as described by Inana
et al. (1988). Actin probing was performed to check
the quality and quantity of RNA present on the blot
for each lane. The intensities of the hybridization
bands were quantitated by densitometry.
Amplification of Genomic DNA by PCR
Short segments of genomic DNA were amplified by
the PCR technique using the Taq DNA polymerase
(Perkin Elmer Cetus). A pair of primers (22-mer) complementary to the sense and antisense strands were
chosen from the intron sequence flanking each exon.

Decreased mRNA in Gyrate Atrophy
PCR amplification was carried out for 30 cycles on a
DNA thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer Cetus); each round
consisted of 1 min at 941C for denaturation, 1 min
at 54-601C for annealing, and 1 min at 720C for
extension.
DGGE

A 5' primer, which included the above-mentioned
original 5'-primer sequences to which a 40-bp GC-rich
sequence (GC clamp) was added, was synthesized
(Sheffield et al. 1989). The amplification was performed using the original 3' primer and the
GC-clamped 5' primer. Each of the amplified sequences was tested with the computer programs
MELT, MU, and SQHTX (Lerman and Silverstein
1987) to determine the optimal condition for the gel
run.
The denaturing gradient gel apparatus used in this
investigation consisted of the PROTEAN® II xi cell
(BIO-RAD) system placed in a 600C water bath (Myers et al. 1987). The denaturing gel is a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel containing a linearly increasing gradient from 20% to 80% denaturant. The 100%
denaturant consists of 7 M urea and 40% (v/v) formamide. The PCR-amplified product was electrophoresed at 80 V or 150 V for 6-15 h. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained in ethidium bromide (2 gg/ml)
for 15 min and was photographed by UV transillumination with Polaroid type 57 panchromatic film.
Direct Sequencing of PCR products
A sequencing primer located internal to the amplification primer for a PCR-amplified DNA was end
labeled with [y-32P] ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) by using
T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase. Double-stranded amplified DNA (200-300 ng) was sequenced by a direct
genomic-sequencing technique using a Sequenase kit
(United States Biochemical) containing T7 polymerase, according to a method described by Newton et al.

(1988).
Results
Southern and Northern Blot Analysis of the OAT Gene
Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA extracted
from skin fibroblasts of patient 2 demonstrated one
normal appearing OAT allele and another with a partial heterozygous deletion, as previously reported
(data not shown; Inana et al. 1988; Hotta et al. 1989).
Southern blot analysis of patients 1 and 3-5 did not

83

reveal any modification of the OAT gene fragments
with the OAT cDNA probe, eliminating the possibility
of a gross deletion or rearrangement of the OAT gene.
Northern blot analysis of skin fibroblast RNA from
the patients with standardization, by actin mRNA hybridization and densitometric analysis, of quantity
and quality of RNA present in each lane demonstrated
a variable decrease in the level of OAT mRNA in five
patients (fig. 1). The steady-state levels of total OAT
mRNA, which were densitometrically determined and
normalized, are shown in table 1. Presumed allelespecific mRNA levels, which had a range of 0%100%, were estimated from the results of the complete
analysis, as described in the Discussion. The analysis
was repeated three times to confirm the results.
DGGE and Direct Sequencing of PCR-amplifled OAT Gene

In patient 1, DGGE revealed two separate exon 3
bands and four exon 6 bands, which represents a pattern for a heterozygote (fig. 2). In exon 6, the bottom
band migrating with the normal band represents the
normal allele, the second band up from the bottom
represents the mutant allele, and the top two bands
represent the heteroduplex DNA fragments produced
by PCR as artifacts. This is a typical DGGE pattern
for heterozygosity. In exon 3, the lower band is made
up of the normal allele and a comigrating mutant allele, making it broader, and the upper band contains
heteroduplex DNA fragments that are comigrating,
resulting in an atypical heterozygous pattern. Direct
sequencing analysis of the PCR-amplified exon 3 region revealed a 2-bp deletion (AG) (fig. 3A) in codons
64 and 65, which results in a reading frameshift and
a premature stop codon at codon 79 (T GAC-TGA
C) in exon 4. Direct sequencing of the exon 6 region
revealed a C--A nucleotide substitution in the second
nucleotide of codon 199, replacing a Pro with a Gln
(data not shown).
Patient 2 was found to have a single exon 6 band
that did not migrate with the normal band (fig. 2). This
single-band pattern in DGGE normally represents a
pattern of a homozygous mutation or failure to obtain
a PCR product from one of the alleles. The latter,
in fact, was the case in this patient, and the pattern
represents a compound heterozygote, because the
other allele has been shown to have a partial deletion
of the gene, including exon 6 (Inana et al. 1988; Akaki
et al., in press). Direct sequencing of the exon 6 region
showed a T--A nucleotide substitution in codon 209
(fig. 3B). This alteration results in a nonsense mutation, replacing a Tyr with a TAA stop codon. The

deletion including exon 6, in the other allele, also results in a premature stop codon in exon 7, because of
a reading frameshift (data not shown; Akaki et al., in
press).
Patient 3 had three separate exon 6 bands by
DGGE, indicating heterozygosity (fig. 2). The bottom
band migrated in a manner identical with that shown
by patient 2's fragment and represents the mutant allele. Direct sequencing analysis of exon 6 showed, in
addition to the normal T nucleotide, T-EA nucleotide
substitution in codon 209 (Tyr to stop codon), identical to that in patient 2, which is consistent with a
pattern for a heterozygote (Fig. 3B). Direct sequencing
of the exon 10 region, where the other mutation was
detected by DGGE, revealed a G-IA nucleotide substitution in the second nucleotide of codon 373, replacing a Gly with a Glu (data not shown).
Patient 4 had three separate bands in exons 6 and
8, by DGGE, indicating heterozygosity in these regions (fig. 2). A heterozygous COG nucleotide substitution in codon 299 in exon 8 was identified by direct
sequencing analysis (Fig. 3C). This mutation results
in a nonsense mutation, replacing a Tyr with a TAG

stop codon. Direct sequencing of the exon 6 region
revealed a heterozygous G--C nucleotide substitution
in the second nucleotide of codon 180, replacing an
Arg with a Thr (data not shown). A homozygous G*C
nucleotide substitution is reported to be indistinguishable by DGGE (Traystman et al. 1990). Thus, in this
case, G*C mutations were detected by DGGE, because oftheir heterozygosity and the presence ofheteroduplex bands.
Patient 5 was found, by DGGE, to have a single
exon 11 band that did not migrate with the normal
band, a result that represents either a pattern for a
homozygous mutation or failure to obtain a PCR
product from one of the alleles (fig. 2). A homozygous
C-OT nucleotide substitution in codon 426 was identified by direct sequencing analysis (Fig. 3D). This mutation results in a nonsense mutation, replacing an Arg
with a TGA stop codon.
Discussion

By analysis of genomic DNA, using PCR in combination with DGGE and direct sequencing, we have

identified four premature-termination codon mutations in the OAT gene of five GA patients: three from
point mutations and one from a frameshift mutation
due to a 2-bp deletion. In one of these cases another
premature-termination mutation which results from
a 1 ,072-bp deletion, elimination of exon 6, and a reading frameshift (Akaki et al., in press) -was also
known. Northern analysis of OAT mRNA in these
cases demonstrated a variable decrease in their
steady-state levels.
The codominance of the expression of the OAT
gene alleles has been amply demonstrated in the past,
at both the protein level and the mRNA level (Valle
et al. 1977; Hotta et al. 1989). Each allele appears to
express its share of OAT independently of the other,
be it at a normal or a subnormal level. This was clearly
demonstrated, at the mRNA level, in obligate heterozygous carriers in a GA family in which the proband
carried two null alleles (Hotta et al. 1989). Thus, one
should be able to make a reasonable estimate of allele-

specific OAT-mRNA levels if information is available
both for the total and for one of the two alleles. Estimation of the allele-specific mRNA levels, on the basis
of this principle and other information (discussed below), indicated that these nonsense mutations result
in a variable decrease in the level of steady-state OAT
mRNA.
Our patient 1 was a compound heterozygote with
a 2-bp deletion producing a premature-termination
codon in one allele and a missense mutation in codon
199 in the other allele, identical to the missense mutation reported by Kaufman et al. (1990). Since no
abnormality of mRNA level was mentioned for the
codon 199 missense mutation, the allele with the
premature-termination codon (new codon 79) appears
to lead to nearly a 100% decrease in the level of its
OAT mRNA, resulting in a net total decrease of approximately 50% (table 1). Patient 2, whose northern
blot analysis revealed no detectable OAT mRNA, had
compound heterozygous mutations in the OAT gene,

consisting of a nonsense mutation in codon 209 in one
allele and a partial deletion (including exon 6) of the
gene, producing, in the other allele, a reading frameshift and a premature translation termination at a new
codon 192 in exon 7. Since no mutation was detected
in the 5'-flanking promoter region of the OAT gene by
direct sequencing analysis, the lack of mRNA expression in both alleles is likely due to the prematuretermination codons (table 1). That the abnormal,
truncated mRNA from the partially deleted allele
could also be unstable and rapidly degraded cannot be
ruled out. Absence of mRNA also explains the negligible amount of immunoreactive OAT protein previously found in fibroblast mitochondria from this patient (Kennaway et al. 1989). Patient 3 was also a
compound heterozygote with a codon 373 missense
mutation and a codon 209 nonsense mutation identical to that in patient 2. In patient 3, as in patient 2,
the allele with the codon 209 nonsense mutation is
predicted not to express OAT mRNA, such that the
missense allele is the only expressing allele, resulting
in a net total OAT mRNA level of 50% (table 1),
which is in agreement with the result from the northern
analysis. Patient 4 was another compound heterozygote with a codon 299 nonsense mutation, a codon
180 missense mutation, and an mRNA decrease. Since
the northern blot analysis of a GA patient with a homozygous codon 180 missense mutation was reported
to show normal mRNA expression (Mitchell et al.
1989b), the decreased level of OAT mRNA must have
resulted from the codon 299 nonsense mutation. The
codon 299 nonsense mutation appears to lead to
nearly a 60%-80% decrease in the level of expressed
OAT mRNA (or expression of 20%-40% of normal),
resulting in a net total decrease of 30%-40% (or net
total expression of 60%-70% of normal) (table 1).
This is consistent with our previous demonstration,
by immunoblotting, of an appreciable level of normal
size OAT protein, presumably expressed by the missense allele in fibroblast mitochondria from this patient (Kennaway et al. 1989). In patient 5, who has a
homozygous codon 426 nonsense mutation, the mutation appears to result in only a slight, equal decrease
(10%-20%) in the level of OAT mRNA for each of
the alleles, which result in a net total decrease of the
same amount (or net total expression of 80%-90% of
normal) (table 1). There is a small possibility that this
patient is actually a compound heterozygote but that
only one allele in the exon 11 region could be PCR
amplified and examined. Even if this were the case and
even if all ofthe mRNA decrease were due to the codon

Mashima et al.
426 nonsense mutation, however, the estimated decrease (20%-40%) would still be the least among all
the nonsense codons examined here.
Thus, the level of mRNA can be affected by a mutation that affects translation, as shown by the five
premature-translation-termination codon mutations
described. In the past, two nonsense-codon mutations
in the OAT gene have been reported. One was a nonsense mutation in the OAT-coding exon 11, codon
396 (CGA--TGA), but the level of OAT mRNA was
not mentioned by Mitchell et al. (1989c). The other
was a splicing mutation in intron 3, causing a reading
frameshift that produced a premature-termination codon (Mitchell et al. 1989a). In this case, the level of
OAT mRNA was reduced to about 10% of normal.
Nonsense mutations (Atweh et al. 1988; Baserga
and Benz 1988; Daar and Maquat 1988; Lim et al.
1989; Urlaub et al. 1989; Kadokawa et al. 1990) and
frameshift mutations that produce a nonsense codon
(Baumann et al. 1985; Fojo et al. 1988; Lim et al.
1989) have been shown to decrease mRNA levels.
Other mutations shown to decrease mRNA levels have
included a deletion that removes both the promoter
and the first exon of a gene (Hobbs et al. 1987) and a
single mutation in the polyadenylation signal sequence
(Higgs et al. 1983). Reversion of mRNA-decreasing
nonsense mutations to either the wild-type or missense
sequence resulted in normalization of the RNA levels
(Urlaub et al. 1989). Three major mechanisms have
been proposed to explain the mRNA decrease due to
nonsense mutations. Nonsense mutations have been
found to decrease mRNA levels by increasing mRNA's
turnover rate without lowering its instantaneous rate
of synthesis (Lim et al. 1989). This increase in turnover is thought to be mediated through ribosomal interaction. When a premature-translation-termination
codon is encountered, ribosomes detach from the
mRNA. The lack of ribosomal binding to a large section of mRNA may expose it to endogenous nuclease
degradation, thus affecting mRNA half-life and turnover (Daar and Maquat 1988). This hypothesis would
predict a positional effect of nonsense-codon mutations, such that an earlier premature termination
would have a more deleterious effect on the mRNA
than would a later one. The other two proposed mechanisms are (1) that the loss of mRNA from nonsense
mutations results from a block in ribosome-mediated
nuclear-to-cytoplasmic transport and/or (2) the effect
that nonsense mutations have on mRNA metabolism
in the nucleus (Humphries et al. 1984; Takeshita et
al. 1984; Baserga and Benz 1988).

unblackened ovals represent the premature terminations due to reading frameshifts. ATG = translation initiation codon; and TGA =
translation-termination codon. Estimated allele-specific OAT mRNA levels are indicated above each premature-termination mutation. The
premature-termination codon generated in exon 7 by a reading frameshift because of a deletion in the exon 6 region (Akaki et al., in press)
is included. The position of this codon in the mutant mRNA is where exon 6 is in the normal mRNA.

The mRNA-decreasing effect of the nonsensecodon mutations appeared to be variable. The degree
to which the mRNA level was affected by the nonsense
mutations appeared to depend on the position of the
mutation in the coding sequence (fig. 4). It has been
reported, for genes such as triosephoiphate isomerase,
that the correlation of mRNA levels with the position
of premature-translation-termination mutations is not
linear (Daar and Maquat 1988) but also that nonsense
codon mutations in the last exon have little effect on
the level of mRNA, whereas nonsense mutations in
the first half of the mRNA result in decreased levels of
mRNA (Baumann et al. 1985; Daar and Maquat
1988; Urlaub et al. 1989). The latter phenomenon
was observed in our five GA patients with the
nonsense-codon mutations. A significant decrease in
OAT mRNA appeared to occur with premature terminations in codons 79 (exon 4), 192 (newly generated
in exon 7), and 209 (exon 6), while very little decrease
of OAT mRNA occurred with a nonsense codon at
426 (exon 11) (fig. 4). The normal length of OAT is
439 amino acids. There was a suggestion of linearity
of the positional effect in our cases, in that the codon
299 (exon 8) nonsense mutation appeared to show an
intermediate level of OAT mRNA decrease (60%80%) (fig. 4). Our results support both (1) the importance of the position of the premature-termination
mutation, with respect to its effect on mRNA, and (2)
the ribosomal detachment hypothesis of the mechanism of mRNA decrease (Daar and Maquat 1988).
Finally, the prevalence of compound heterozygosity
(patients 1-4) and the diversity of the mutations (eight

different mutations in five patients) confirmed the
enormous genetic heterogeneity present in this disease.
