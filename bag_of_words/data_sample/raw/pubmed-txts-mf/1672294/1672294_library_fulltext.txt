INTRODUCTION
Classical
phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal
recessive genetic disorder that results from a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH).
PKU patients develop severe mental retardation unless rigorously maintained on a low-phenylalanine
diet [for a review, see Striver et al. (1989)]. Analysis of
eight rest,riction fragment-length
polymorphisms
(RFLPs) in or near the PAH gene has defined approximately 50 different RFLP haplotypes (Woo, 1989).
Haplotype analysis reveals heterozygosity in 87.5% of
all cases among northern European populations and
has been effective in determining carrier status and

Unlike haplotypes 2 and 3, haplotypes 1 and 4 are
well represented among normal chromosomes in the
northern European population and should therefore
have a higher probability of sustaining random mutational events. This prediction was confirmed with the
identification of independent mutations associated
with mutant haplotype 1 and 4 chromosomes. The
R261Q and E280K mutations are associated with
haplotype 1 PKU chromosomes (Okano et al.,
1990a,b) and the R158Q and Y414C mutations are
associated with haplotype 4 PKU chromosomes in the

performing prenatal diagnosis (Woo et al., 1983;
Lidsky et al., 1985; Daiger et al., 1986; Chakraborty et
al., 1987). Unfortunately,
RFLP haplotype analysis
can be performed only in families with a prior history
of PKU. To overcome this limitation, analysis of the
mutational events that underlie PAH deficiencies was
begun.
Thus far, studies of PAH RFLP haplotype distribution and mutation analysis have been performed
primarily on northern European populations. In
these populations, about 90% of the PKU chromosomes are confined to RFLP haplotypes l-4. Moreover, haplotypes 2 and 3 are especially prevalent
among PKU chromosomes, but are relatively rare
among normal chromosomes (Chakraborty
et al..
1987; Aulehla-Scholz’et
al., 1988; Herrmann et al..
1988; Lichter-Konecki et al.. 198813;Rey et al., 1988;
Riess et al., 1988; Daiger et al., 1989; Sullivan et al.,
1989). The characterization of PKU mutations at the
molecular level therefore began with the identificat,ion of the molecular lesions present. on mutant haplotype 2 and 3 chromosomes in the northern European population. These studies identified an R408W
mutation on a haplotype 2 chromosome and a splicing
mutation at the exon 12/intron 12 boundary on a
haplotype 3 chromosome. Together, these two mutations represent about half of all PKU mutations present in the northern European population (DiLella et

Two missense mutations have been identified in the phenylalanine hydroxylase
(PAH) genesof anItalian phenylketonuria (PKU) patient. Both mutations occurred in exon 7
of the PAH gene, resulting
in the substitution
of Trp for
Arg at amino acid 252 (R252W)
and of Leu for Pro
(P281L) at amino acid 281 of the protein. Expression vectors containing
either the normal human PAH cDNA or
mutant cDNAs were constructed and transfected into cultured mammalian
cells. Extracts
from cells transfected
with either mutant construct showed negligible enzyme activity and undetectable levels of immunoreactive
PAH protein as compared to the normal construct. These results are
compatible
with the severe classical PKU phenotype observed in this patient. Population
genetic studies in the Italian population
revealed
that both the R252W and the
P281L mutations are in linkage disequilibrium
with mutant restriction
fragment
length polymorphism
(RFLP)
haplotype 1, which is the most prevalent RFLP haplotype
in this population.
The R252W mutation is present in lo?&
and the P281L mutation is present in 20% of haplotype 1
mutant chromosomes. These mutations are both very rare
among other European
populations,
suggesting
a Medit 1991

In Italy, the distribution
of RFLP haplotypes associated with PKU chromosomes
is rather different
from that in other European countries. Mutant haplotype 1 and 6 chromosomes
are prevalent
in Italy,
representing
39.7 and 17.6% of all PKU chromosomes, respectively;
mutant haplotype 2 and 3 chromosomes are very rare in Italy, representing
less than
6% of all PKU chromosomes
(Dianzani et al., 1990).
Since the distribution
of RFLP haplotypes is significantly different between the Italian and northern European populations,
it is possible that these populations each contain a set of PKU mutations
distinct
from the other. This paper reports the identification
and characterization
of two missense mutations associated with haplotype 1 chromosomes
in the Italian
population.

METHODS

Analysis

Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes of an
Italian PKU patient homozygous for RFLP haplotype 1. Individual exons of the PAH gene and their
flanking intronic sequenceswere amplified from genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
as described elsewhere (Wang et al., 1990a). Amplification primers and allele-specific oligonucleotide
(ASO) probes were purchased from Genetic Designs
Inc., Houston, Texas. Amplified exonic DNA was purified by elution from 4% Nusieve agarose gel and recovered using Gene-Clean (Bio 101). The purified double-stranded DNA was sequenced directly using Sequenase (USB) and dimethyl sulfoxide, as described
elsewhere (Wang et al., 1990a).
Dot-Blot Hybridization

Analysis

Genomic DNA samples, amplified by PCR as described above, were denatured and applied directly
onto zeta-probe membranes (Bio-Rad) using a dotblot manifold (S & S) (DiLella et al., 1988). AS0
probes (17-mers) for the normal and mutant alleles
were end-labeled with [y-3”P]ATP
(6000 Ci/mmol,
NEN) using polynucleotide kinase (Pharmacia). Hybridization and washing were performed as described
by DiLella and Woo (1987).
Mutagenesis and Expression Analysis
The mutant PAH cDNAs were prepared using the
site-directed mutagenesis method of Zoller and Smith
(1983), as modified by Okano et al. (1990a). The authenticity of the mutant clone was confirmed by DNA
sequence analysis of the mutagenized site. Double-

MUTATIONS

stranded M13mp18 vectors containing either the mutant PAH cDNA or the normal PAH cDNA were prepared and digested with EcoRI. The mutant and normal PAH cDNAs were purified with 1% low melting
agarose gel and separately subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA 1 (Invitrogen).
This vector contains a CMV promotor and enhancer,
the splice segment and polyadenylation
signal of
SV40, and the poliovirus eukaryotic origin of replication. The recombinant clones (70 pg), along with
pCDNA 1 containing a @-galactosidase cDNA (30 pg),
were cotransfected into monkey kidney COS cells using electroporation (Chu et al., 1987). Immunoreactive PAH was identified by Western blotting, using
a goat anti-rat PAH antibody (Robson et al., 1982)
and swine anti-goat
IgG-alkaline
phosphatase
(Boehringer-Mannheim)
following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretic transfer
to nitrocellulose paper. PAH RNA and enzymatic activity were determined in cellular extracts as described (Ledley et al., 1985, 1987). /3-Galactosidase
enzyme activity, measured as described by Nielsen et
al. (1983), was used to determine the relative efficiency of each transfection.
RESULTS

Identification of Missense Mutations
PAH Gene

in the Human

Direct sequence analysis of exon 7 plus flanking
intronic region of the PAH gene from an Italian PKU
patient revealed the presence of two mutations. The
first mutation is a C-to-T transition at the first base
of codon 252, resulting in the substitution of Trp
(TGG) for Arg (CGG). Examination of the sequence
gel shown in Fig. 1A demonstrated the presence of
two bands (C and T) at the same position but with
reduced intensity in the patient’s DNA sequence,
whereas only a single band (C) is present in the DNA
sequence from a normal individual. This result indicates that this patient bears two different PAH alleles, one of which bears the R252W mutation and
one of which is normal at this position. The second
mutation is also a C-to-T transition, this time at the
second base of codon 281, which is also the last nucleotide in exon 7 of the human PAH gene. This mutation results in the substitution of Leu (CTT) for
Pro (CCT). The sequence gel of this region (Fig. 1B)
also revealed the presence of two different PAH alleles in the patient, one of which bears the P281L
mutation and one of which is normal at this position.

Correlation between PAH Genotype and PKU
Phenotype
The proband in this study is homozygous for haplotype 1 by RFLP analysis, but is shown to be a compound heterozygote of the R252W and P281L mutations, which both show less than 1% of normal PAH
activity in expression analysis. This patient exhibits a
classical PKU phenotype, i.e., is severely affected
with PKU (Giittler, 1980). The correlation between
PAH genotypes and PKU phenotypes in three other
Italian PKU patients is shown in Table 2. Patient A
bears two RFLP haplotype 1 chromosomes, one of
which contains the R252W mutation and one which
contains an unknown mutation, and shows a severe
PKU phenotype. The second patient (patient B), homozygous for RFLP haplotype 1, is also homozygous
for the codon P281L mutation, and shows a severe
PKU phenotype. Finally, patient C is a compound
heterozygote for haplotypes 1 and 6. The haplotype 1
chromosome in this patient bears the P281L mutation, while the haplotype 6 chromosome bears an unknown mutation. This patient also exhibits a severe
PKU phenotype. Since mild mutations will be dominant over severe mutations in the clinical manifestation of PKU, both of these mutant alleles must be
associated with the classical PKU phenotype, regardless of what the unknown mutations are in patients A
and C.

DISCUSSION

We have identified two missense mutations associated with mutant haplotype 1 chromosomes of an
Italian PKU patient. The first mutation is characterized by a single nucleotide substitution (C for T) at
the first base of codon 252 in exon 7 of the PAH gene.
This mutation is the same substitution that has been
previously reported as a polymorphism in a French
PKU patient (Abadie et al., 1989). The R252W mutation is found in 10% of all haplotype 1 PKU chromosomes in Italy, but is less frequent in France (Abadie
et al., 1989) and in Switzerland (unpublished observation), representing only about 6% of haplotype 1 PKU
chromosomes in these latter populations. The second
mutation is a substitution of a T for a C at the second
base of codon 281 in exon 7. This mutation is tightly
linked to RFLP mutant haplotype 1 chromosomes in
Italy, where it constitutes about 20% of all mutant
haplotype 1 chromosomes and approximately 10% of
all PKU chromosomes.
Expression analysis in cultured mammalian cells
demonstrated that both mutant constructs produce
less than 1% of normal PAH activity and undetectable immunoreactive protein by Western blotting, despite the presence of comparable amounts of PAH
mRNA. These results suggest that the extremely low
level of PAH activity observed in cells transfected
with either mutant construct is most probably the result of instability of the mutant proteins. However,
since the P281L mutation involves a substitution in
the last nucleotide in exon 7, the nucleotide adjacent
to the invariant dinucleotide present in the splicing
signal at the exon 7/intron 7 border, it is also conceivable that this mutation could affect proper splicing of
the mRNA transcript in human liver cells. Recently,
several other mutation reports have described similar,

single-base changes that occur at this position in
other genes (Grompe et al., 1989; Hodges and Rosenberg, 1989; Navon and Proia, 1989; Kobayashi et al..
1990). In some cases, the mutation not only results in
an amino acid substitution, but also affects RNA
splicing (Hodges and Rosenvsberg, 1989), whereas in
other cases, RNA splicing is unaffected (Navon and
Proia, 1989; Kobayashi et al., 1990). Since PKU patients homozygous for the P281L mutation exhibit a
severe phenotype, it is not yet clear which of these
effects may be occurring in situ.
Five PKU mutations (R243X, R252W, R26lQ,
E280K, and P281L) have been now found in exon 7 of
the PAH gene. This number represents approximately 40% of all known PKU mutations in Caucasians. There would appear to be several facts that may
account for the relatively large number of PKU mutations present in exon 7. First, exon 7 lies within the
most highly conserved region between human PAH
and that from the prokaryote Chromobacterium
uiolaceum (S. J. Benkovic, personal communication). Second, this region is also highly conserved among the
related aromatic amino acid hydroxylases human
PAH, rabbit tryptophan hydroxylase, and rat tyrosine hydroxylase (Grenett et al., 1987). Third, exon 7
contains 6 of a total of 23 CpG dinucleotides present
in the coding region of the PAH gene. CpG dinucleotides sustain a high frequency of mutation, probably
resulting from methylation and subsequent deamination of cytosine to thymidine (Cooper and Youssoufian, 1988). All five mutations observed thus far in
exon 7 occur at CpG dinucleotides.
Within the past few years, many mutations associated with PKU have been identified in different populations (DiLella et al., 1986, 1987; Lichter-Konecki
et al., 1988a; Abadie et al., 1989; John et al., 1989;
Lyonnet et al., 1989; Wang et al., 1989, 1990a,b; Avi-

MISSENSE

gad et al., 1990; Dworniczak
et al., 1990; Okano et al.,
1990a-c). From these data, it is clear that within specific populations
there exists a close association
between PAH RFLP haplotypes and PKU and hyperphenylalaninemia
(HPA)
mutations.
However,
the
distribution
of these haplotypes
among normal and
mutant chromosomes
is very different in genetically
distinct populations.
Thus, each unique population
has its own unique distribution
of PKU and HPA mutations. For example, among northern Europeans, the
RFLP haplotypes
most commonly
associated
with
mutant chromosomes
are haplotypes 2 and 3, which
together constitute
about 60% of all PKU chromosomes in Denmark.
In Italy, however, haplotypes
2
and 3 are rare, representing
only about 7% of all PKU
chromosomes,
while haplotypes
1 and 6 represent
about 60% of all PKU chromosomes.
It is not surprising, then, to note that the previously reported R408W
and exon 12/intron
12 splicing mutations,
tightly
linked to mutant haplotypes 2 and 3, respectively
(DiLella et al., 1986,1987), account for nearly all mutant
haplotypes 2 and 3 chromosomes
in northern Europe,
whereas in Italy, these two mutations
are very rare,
representing
only a small percentage of mutant haplotype 2 and 3 alleles (Dianzani
et al., 1990). Similarly, the R261Q mutation
in haplotype
1 and the
R158Q and Y414C mutations in haplotype 4 are prevalent in northern
Europe, but are rare in Italy. In
contrast,
the P281L mutation
is tightly
linked to
RFLP haplotype 1 in Italy, where it accounts for 20%
of all mutant haplotype 1 chromosomes
and 10% of all
PKU chromosomes,
but is rare in northern Europe,
with only two alleles present in Denmark
(2.5% of all
Danish PKU chromosomes)
and one allele present in
Switzerland
(2.5% of all Swiss PKU chromosomes)
(unpublished
observations).
Furthermore,
in Denmark, the P28lL mutation
is not tightly linked to
haplotype 1, but is associated with both haplotypes 1
and 4 (unpublished
observation).
These population
data suggest that the P281L mutation may have occurred in the Mediterranean
area on a haplotype 1
chromosome
and then spread through Switzerland
to
Denmark
and other northern European countries.
Recently, four additional P281L alleles have been
detected in nonhaplotyped
samples, bringing the total
number of P281L alleles in the Italian sample population t,o eight,. Although five of these P281L alleles are
present in individuals born in or near Sicily (Catania,
Palermo, Reggio Calabria), the other three alleles are
present in patients born in northern
Italy (Genoa,
Milan). Similarly, two additional R252W alleles have
been detected in the nonhaplotyped
samples, bringing
the total number of R252W alleles to three. These
three mutant alleles are present in patients born in
northern
Italy (Alba, Milan). Although
the sample
numbers are small and the Italian population has ex-

101

MUTATIONS

perienced increased mobility in recent generations,
these data do provide some additional support for the
hypothesis that the P281L mutation may have originated in the Mediterranean
area.
Lyonnet et al. (1989) have previously
reported a
mutation (E280K) tightly linked to RFLP haplotype
38 in the Algerian population. This mutation was reported to be associated with a mild Mediterraneanlike phenotype in homozygous individuals.
However,
in the present study, neither haplotype 38 nor the
E280K mutation was observed in the Italian population (unpublished
data). In addition, the results of the
in vitro expression analysis of the R252W and P28lL
mutations are compatible with the severe clinical phenotype observed in patients bearing these mutations.
Thus, if there is in fact a mild PKU subform present
in Italy, the mutations responsible for this form have
not yet been identified. These observations
reinforce
the notion that there are clear and significant differences between unique populations that are not merely
the result of geography but are based on underlying
genetic differences.
