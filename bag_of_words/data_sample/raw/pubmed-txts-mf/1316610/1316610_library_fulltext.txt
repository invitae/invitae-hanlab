To answer this question, and to further investigate the
nature of inherited APC gene mutations, we have now
examined the entire coding region of APC in 79 unrelated
kindreds with FAP. We were able to identify presumptive
mutations in 53 of these kindreds, suggesting that APC is
responsible for the great majority of FAP cases. Remarkably,
>90% of the mutations resulted in truncations of the predicted protein product. These results have significant theoretical and practical implications for understanding etiology
and diagnosing disease in susceptible individuals.

We searched for germ-line mutations of the
ABSTRACT
APC gene in 79 unrelated patients with familial adenomatous
polyposis using a ribonuclease protection analysis coupled with
polymerase chain reaction ampliflications of genomic DNA.
Mutations were found in 53 patients (67%); 28 of the mutations
were small deletions and 2 were 1- to 2-base-pair insertions; 19
were point mutations resulting in stop codons and only 4 were
missense point mutations. Thus, 92% of the mutations were
predicted to result in truncations of the APC protein. More
than two-thirds (68%) of the mutations were clustered in the 5'
halfof the last exon, and nearly two-fifths of the total mutations
occurred at one of five positions. This information has significant implications for understanding the role of APC mutation
in inherited forms of colorectal neoplasia and for designing
effective methods for genetic counseling and presymptomatic

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Genomic DNA of FAP Patients. FAP patients were identified on the basis of clinical manifestation. Genomic DNAs of
79 unrelated patients, including 55 American and 24 Japanese
kindreds, were prepared from leukocytes as described (14).
PCR. The coding region of the APC gene was divided into
31 segments (see Results), and each segment was separately
amplified using PCR (15). The primer pairs used in this study
are listed in Table 1. PCR was performed with 38 cycles for
0.5 min at 950C, 2 min at 510C, and 2 min at 700C as described
by Baker et al. (16).
RNase Protection Analysis. RNase protection assay was
performed by the method of Winter et al. (17) as modified by
Kinzler et al. (9). Briefly, PCR products were hybridized to
32P-labeled RNA transcripts corresponding to normal APC
sequences, cloned, and labeled as described by Nishisho et
al. (11). The hybrids were digested with RNase A, which
cleaves at mismatches within DNA-RNA hybrids. The size of
the digestion products was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. Two separate RNase protection analyses

diagnosis.
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomaldominant inherited disease, affecting 1 in 5000 and 1 in 17,000
of the American and Japanese populations, respectively (1).
FAP is characterized by the development of hundreds to
thousands of adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum,
one or more of which can progress to cancer if left without
surgical treatment. Neoplasia is not limited to the colon and
rectum of patients with FAP, as some patients are affected
with desmoid tumors, osteomas, fibromas, and various other
neoplasms in addition to polyps.
Cytogenetic and linkage studies have localized the gene
responsible for FAP to chromosome 5q21 (2-5), a region that
is also deleted commonly in sporadic colorectal tumors (6-8).
Hence, it was considered likely that germ-line or somatic
mutations of chromosome 5q21 gene(s) would lead to adenoma formation in familial and sporadic forms (6).
Recently, several chromosome 5q21 genes were identified
(9-13). One of them (the MCC gene) was shown to be
somatically mutated in a subset of sporadic colorectal cancers. Another (the APC gene) was shown to undergo similar
somatic mutations and also to be mutated in the germ-line of
patients with FAP. APC and MCC were predicted to encode
coiled-coil proteins that might interact in vivo with themselves or with other proteins.
In our initial study, we examined three exons of APC in 103
kindreds with FAP and found germ-line mutations in five of
them (11). Groden et al. (12) examined a large portion of the
APC gene product but found only four mutations in 61
separate kindreds. These studies thus left open the question
of whether other genes might be involved in a substantial
number of kindreds.

were done by using sense and antisense strands.
Cloning and Sequence Analysis. PCR products showing
abnormalities in RNase protection patterns were cloned into
a plasmid vector (pBluescript SK Stratagene) as described
(11). DNAs from a pool of at least 50 subclones were used as
a template for each DNA sequencing reaction. DNA sequencing was carried out according to the method described
by Nigro et al. (18). Sequencing of both strands of genomic
DNA was performed to confirm a mutation.

RESULTS
We examined the entire coding region of the APC gene in the
germ line of 79 unrelated FAP patients by an RNase protection assay. The coding region of the APC gene is contained
within 15 exons (nos. 1-15) (9, 11), preceded by at least one
5' noncoding exon (unpublished data). The coding region was

The amplified regions are indicated by exon and codons contained within each fragment. Exon 15 is divided into 17 overlapping segments,
each "400 bp in length. Primers are described from the 5' -- 3' direction and some of them include EcoRI (*), BamHI (t), or HindIII (f) sites

divided into 31 segments. The first 14 segments corresponded
to 14 individual exons. The coding region in the last exon (no.
15) is very large [6571 base pairs (bp)] and was divided into
17 overlapping segments, each -=400 bp in length. These 31
segments were individually amplified from each of the 79
patients and subjected to RNase protection analyses as
described in Material and Methods.
Fig. 1 presents examples of RNase protection analyses in
which variations were observed. PCR products in which
variations were detected were cloned into a plasmid vector
and sequenced (examples in Fig. 2). Patient 100 had a C -- A
transversion at the second nucleotide of codon 932, resulting
in a change from serine (TCA) to a stop codon (TAA) (Fig.
2A, lane 2). Patient 16 showed a 2-bp deletion (AG) of codon
1465 (AjT) (Fig. 2B, lane 2). A T insertion at the second
nucleotide of codon 1211 (ATTG) was found in patient 39
(Fig. 2C, lane 2, beginning at arrow).
The results from the PCR-RNase protection analyses are
summarized in Table 2. Presumptive mutations altering the
sequence of the predicted protein product were observed in
53 of the 79 patients studied. No patient had more than one
of these mutations, and none of these mutations was observed in the germ-line DNA of at least 100 individuals
without FAP studied by RNase protection assay or direct
sequencing of PCR products.
Nature of Mutations. As summarized in Table 3, 23 of the
53 alterations were point mutations. Nineteen of them generated stop codons. Two of the four amino acid changes were
nonconservative (resulting in the substitution of cysteine for
serine or arginine), and two were functionally conservative
(serine to threonine or leucine to phenylalanine, respectively). Twenty-one of the 23 mutations resulted in a change from
C to some other nucleotides in which C -+ T was the most
common (Table 4). The point mutations were scattered
throughout the gene and no "hot spot" was detected; only

the point mutations at codon 302 and 625 were observed in
more than one kindred (Table 2).
Thirty of the 53 mutations were associated with frameshifts
due to deletions (28 cases) or insertions (2 cases) (Table 3).
Deletions of 1-5 bp were observed, with 5 bp being most
common (18 of the 28 deletion mutations involved 5 bp).
Interestingly, a 5-bp deletion at codon 1309 was observed in
10 separate kindreds; this was by far the most common
genetic alteration observed among the families. All of the
deletion and insertion mutations altered the reading frame
and created stop codons immediately downstream.
Distribution of Mutations. The distribution of mutations in
the APC gene in the 53 FAP patients is shown in Fig. 3. Point
mutations were found in exons 5, 6, 8, 9, and 12-15. However,
all but one of the 30 cases of deletion or insertion were found
in exon 15 (one case was at the exon-intron junction of exon
4). Thirty-six (68%) of the total mutations (including point
mutations and frameshifts) were clustered within the 5' half of
exon 15 (codons 713-1597), representing less than one-third of
the coding region. Five specific mutations were found in more
than one unrelated kindred (Table 2 and Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION
Most of the mutations described in this study are predicted to
have profound effects on the predicted gene products. Fortynine (92%) of the mutations led to incomplete products of the
APC gene due to translational termination; 19 of the 23 point
mutations were nonsense mutations and all 30 frameshift
mutations created new stop codons immediately downstream. Missense mutations were observed in only four
patients. In two of these four cases, the change to cysteine
from arginine or serine is expected to have significant effects
on the structure of the predicted protein. The other two
changes were relatively conservative, and we cannot be sure

that these substitutions represent true mutations rather than
rare variations with no functional effect. However, this serine
to threonine (patient 3) or leucine to phenylalanine (patient
89) change was the only change detected by RNase protection analyses of the entire coding region, except one amino
acid polymorphism of patient 3 (described below). As the
biochemical and physiologic properties of the APC protein
are unknown, these missense mutations might prove to be
valuable for assessing function and to provide clues for
localizing the critical effector domains of the very large
protein encoded by the APC gene.
Ninety-one percent of the 23 point mutations resulted in a
substitution for C, most commonly with a T (Table 4). These
occurred at seven CA sites, five CG sites, and one CT site.
Deamination of 5-methylcytosine in the CpG dinucleotide has
been implicated as a mechanism for point mutation from C to
T (19). But only five of our cases involved CpG sites (Table
2). The mechanism for CpA to TpA and CpT to TpT change
is not known. However, as the most common DNA polymerase error is thought to be a G mispairing with T (20) with
a lack of repair at this mismatch (21), the CpA to TpA and
CpT to TpT mutations we observed might have been generated in this manner.
Twenty-eight of the 30 cases with frameshifts were associated with small deletions (Table 2). It is well known that
deletions occur at repeated bases, perhaps because of misalignment; for example, we observed a C deletion from CCC
(at codon 1427), an A deletion from several As (codon 142),
and an AA deletion from AAA (codon 1250). A model for
generating misalignment within a stretch of common bases

has been proposed (22, 23). Some deletions were observed at
positions containing several copies of a direct repeat; for
example, an AG deletion was detected at the sequence of
AAGAGj&jAG~AGAGTG (codon 1465), an AAAGA deletion
at ATAAAAGAAAAGATT (codon 1309), an ACAAA deletion from ATAAAACAAAGT (codon 1061), and a TGAAA
A
deletion from TC
C (codon 1546). All of these
deletions might have occurred during DNA replication as a
result of slippage of the template strand and subsequent
misalignment (24). After synthesis of the first copy of the
direct repeat, the template strand could slip and misalign with
the second copy of the repeat, resulting in deletion of the
intervening sequences.
All but one of the frameshift mutations due to insertions or
deletions were detected within exon 15, but point mutations
were scattered throughout exons 5-15. The most frequent
mutation was observed at codon 1309. As this mutation was
observed in Caucasian, Black, and Japanese populations, a
founder effect is excluded.
In the course of RNase protection analyses, we found
several polymorphisms within the coding sequences resulted
with and without amino acid changes. Four major polymorphisms are TAC/TAT (at codon 486), GCA/GCG (at codon

1678). All of these polymorphisms have not changed coding
amino acids-tyrosine, alanine, threonine, and glycine, respectively. The first polymorphism of the tyrosine coding
sequences creates restriction fragment length polymorphism
with Rsa I. This polymorphism and the last glycine coding
polymorphism are the same as reported previously (12). The
allelic frequencies of these polymorphisms ranged from 0.36
to 0.64 (data not shown). Five other polymorphisms,,with
allelic frequencies of <0.01, were also recognized. Two
resulted in amino acid substitution-ATA (isoleucine) to

on the predicted gene products (Table 2), we think these
amino acid changes probably do not alter the function of the
predicted proteins. The other three rare polymorphisms were
TTG/TTA at codon 548 of patient 90, ATA/ATT at codon
1055 of patient 22, and CTA/TTA at codon 2401 of patient 1;
none of these resulted in amino acid changes.
We detected mutations in 67% of FAP patients using an
RNase protection assay. We did not find mutations in all
patients for the following reasons. (i) Some mismatches are
protected from RNase digestion. In fact, the reported sensitivity of detecting mutations with RNase is only 35-50% (11,
25, 26). We attribute our higher success rate to the fact that
so many of the mutations in the APC gene were small
deletions or insertions, which are usually quite susceptible to
digestion with RNase A. (ii) The promoter region of the APC

gene expression. (iv) There may be a second FAP gene. We
think, however, that the latter possibility is now unlikely.

10.

The results of the studies described above provide significant insights into the nature of the mutations leading to FAP.
They suggest that the carboxyl terminus is required for
function, because deletions that remove this end of the
protein (including a deletion that removes only the last 200
amino acids of the 2843-residue protein) result in disease.
Further studies will be required to determine whether specific
mutations are associated with specific phenotypes (such as
early age at onset or a high prevalence of extracolonic
neoplasms). However, these studies already provide a basis
for presymptomatic diagnosis. In 53 kindreds reported here,
such diagnoses can now be made with virtually 100%o accuracy simply by testing for the relevant mutation. In kindreds
not yet studied, it would seem advisable to begin screening
for mutations at the five positions accounting for nearly 40%
of the total alterations detected (Table 2). If these were
negative, the next logical step would be to examine the 5' half
of exon 15, which contained more than two-thirds of the
mutations. Only if this failed would an analysis of the
remainder of the gene be warranted. Finally, these studies
suggest an alternative method of examination for APC mutations. Ninety-two percent of the total mutations detected
are predicted to result in truncated protein products. Thus,
detection of these shortened proteins using antibodies against
the APC protein is likely to be a valuable screening method
in a high fraction of kindreds.
