type I collagen of which OI type I, an autosomal dominant
condition, is the mildest and most common form. Affected indi-

common form, 01 type I, is characterized by normal or near
normal stature, bone fragility without significant deformity,
osteopenia, blue sclerae, and inheritance in an autosomal
dominant fashion (1). Adult onset hearing loss and/or dentinogenesis imperfecta are seen in some kindreds. Family studies have demonstrated linkage of the 01 type I phenotype to
restriction fragment length polymorphisms in COLlA1, the
gene encoding the proal(I) chain of type I collagen, in the
majority of cases, and to sites in COLlA2, the gene encoding
the proa2(I) chain of type I collagen, in the minority (2-4).
Little is known about the nature ofthe mutations that result in
01 type I, except that dermal fibroblasts from affected individuals produce and efficiently secrete about half the expected
amount of structurally normal type I collagen (4, 5). The abnormality in type I collagen production is reflected in altered
ratios of type I to type III collagen in skin (4), and represents
the most characteristic biochemical correlate of the phenotype.
Barsh et al. (6) demonstrated that the disturbance in type I
collagen production is due to decreased synthesis of proal(I)
chains in the patients they studied. Dermal fibroblasts from
these individuals synthesized proa 1(I) and proa2(I) chains in a
1:1 ratio instead of the expected 2:1 ratio. Additional analyses
by Rowe et al. (7) and Genovese and Rowe (8) and by our
laboratory (Willing, M. C., and P. H. Byers, unpublished observations) indicate that the decreased proa I(I) production reflects a reduction in steady-state COLlA1 mRNA levels.
These data, taken together suggest that 01 type I frequently
results from mutations that affect the apparent expression of
COLlA 1, but the mechanisms by which expression is altered
are not clear.
In this paper we describe a three-generation family with OI
type I in which all affected members have a 5 bp deletion that
disrupts the 3' intragenic Eco RI site in one COLlAl allele.
The deletion creates a shift in the translational reading-frame
of the protein beginning at the Eco RI site, which is located 30
bp from the normal protein termination site, and predicts a
protein that extends beyond the normal termination point by
84 amino acid residues. Although the mutant proa l(I) chain is
synthesized in an in vitro translation system, we are unable to
detect its presence in intact cells, suggesting that it is unstable,
rapidly degraded, and thus unable to participate in heterotrimer assembly. These findings indicate that mutations that
alter protein stability, in addition to those that interfere with
nuclear processing (8) can result in decreased production of
type I collagen and produce the OI type I phenotype.

Methods

viduals have blue sclerae, normal stature, bone fragility without significant deformity and osteopenia. Fibroblasts from
most affected individuals produce about half the expected
amount of structurally normal type I collagen as a result of
decreased synthesis of one of its constituent chains, proal(I),
but the nature of the mutations which result in 01 type I are
unknown. We describe a three generation family with OI type I
in which all affected members have one normal COLlA1 allele
and another from which the intragenic Eco RI restriction site
near the 3' end of the gene is missing. Amplification by polymerase chain reaction and sequence determination of the normal allele and of the mutant allele in the domain that normally
contains the Eco RI site demonstrated a 5-bp deletion frop the
mutant allele. The deletion changes the translational readingframe beginning at the Eco RI site and predicts the synthesis of
a proal(I) chain that extends 84 amino acids beyond the normal termination. Although the mutant proal(I) chain is synthesized in an in vitro translation system, we are unable to
detect its presence in intact cells, suggesting that it is unstable
and rapidly destroyed in one of the cell's degradative pathways.
Our analysis of individuals with 01 type I from 20 families
indicates that this is a unique mutation and suggests that the
phenotype can result from multiple mechanisms that decrease
the synthesis of normal type I procollagen molecules, including
those that alter protein stability. (J. Clin. Invest. 1990.

Clinical summary. The proband (11-2) (see pedigree in Fig. 2) is a
33-yr-old Caucasian male with normal stature, mild scoliosis, blue
sclerae, normal hearing and dentition, and a history of multiple fractures that have healed without deformity. He has a son with a similar

phenotype and an unaffected daughter. Within the family there is
clinical heterogeneity. Two individuals (I-2 and II-4) have had repeated
fractures, bony deformity in the lower extremities, and severe osteopenia, which lead to above the knee amputations for both. Neither has
upper extremity deformity and both have blue sclerae. Individual II-4
has a son who appears more mildly affected.

Cell culture and electrophoretic analysis of labeled proteins. Skin
biopsies were taken from four affected (1-2, 11-2, 11-4, and 111-1) and
from one unaffected family member (11-3), after receiving appropriate
consent. The biopsies were explanted and dermal fibroblasts were
grown in Dulbecco-Vogt modified Eagle's medium (DME) that contained 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 Mg/ml of
streptomycin. Labeling proteins with [2,3,4,5 3H]proline (Amersham
Corp., Arlington Heights, IL; 101 Ci/mmol) and [35S]cysteine (Amersham Corp.; 600 Ci/mmol), harvesting of medium and cell layer proteins, SDS-PAGE, cleavage of proteins with cyanogen bromide (CNBr)
in gels and two-dimensional analysis of CNBr peptides of type I collagen were all carried out as previously described (9, 10).
For short pulse experiments, dermal fibroblasts were plated in
DME with 10% fetal calf serum at a density of 250,000 cells per 35-mm
dish and allowed to attach overnight. An entire dish was used for each
time point. The next day, the tissue culture medium was replaced with
DME that contained 1.5% NuSerum (Collaborative Research, Inc.,
Bedford, MA) and ascorbic acid (50 jig/ml) and the cells were incubated for 2 h. After trypsinization, the cells from each dish were pelleted in microfuge tubes and resuspended in DME that contained 1.5%
NuSerum and 100 MCi [3H]proline (Amersham Corp.). All labeling
reactions were carried out at 370C. At the end of each time period (5,
10, and 15 min), 1 ml ofice-cold DME was added to each tube, and the
cells were rapidly pelleted and lysed in an inhibitor solution containing
PBS, I I mM EDTA, 10 mM PMSF, 45 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4,180 mM
NaCl, and 4.5% SDS, and boiled for 2 min. Radiolabeled procollagens
were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with 2 M urea under reducing conditions, and the separated proteins were identified following radioautofluorography with EN3HANCE (New England Nuclear, Boston, MA)
as the fluor (9, 10).
Restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic DNA. Aliquots of
genomic DNA prepared from cultured dermal fibroblasts or from
lymphocytes were digested with Eco RI (New England Biolabs, Inc.,
Beverly, MA) according to manufacturer's specifications, the fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose and transferred to nitrocellulose (1 1). The filter was hybridized separately with
COL I A I cDNA Hf677 fragments (12) and with a 5-kb genomic fragment from COLIAI clone CG103 (13). Hybridization probes were
labeled with a-[32PJdCTP (New England Nuclear, Inc., Boston, MA)
by random primer extension (14).
cDNA synthesis. Dermal fibroblasts were grown to near confluence
in DME with 10% FCS and 100 U/ml of penicillin and 100 jg/ml of
streptomycin. 1 d before RNA isolation, cells were incubated in DME
with 20% FCS and 50 .g/ml of ascorbic acid. Total cellular, nuclear,
and cytoplasmic RNA were isolated as previously described (15, 16).
Before cDNA synthesis, the RNA was resuspended in 40 mM Tris pH
7.8, 10 mM NaCl, 6 mM MgCl2 and incubated with RNase-free DNase
(Promega-Biotek, Madison, WI; 2.5 U/ml) at 37°C for 30 min. 10 Mg
of RNA was precipitated with the appropriate 3' synthetic oligonucleotide primer (Operon Technologies, Inc., San Pablo, CA), and resuspended in an RNase-free solution of 160 mM KC1, 10 mM Tris-HCI
pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA with 12.5 U of RNasin (Promega-Biotek; 25
U/MI). The RNA was denatured at 94°C for 5 min, followed by a 5-min
incubation at 37°C to allow for primer annealing. The cDNA synthesis
was carried out at 45°C for 30 min in a final reaction cocktail containing 10 mM MgCI2, 55 mM Tris pH 8.3, 80 MM deoxynucleotide
triphosphates with 37.5 U of RNasin, and 40 U of AMV reverse transcriptase (Life Sciences, Inc., St. Petersburg, FL) (17). Before addition
of the reverse transcriptase, the sample was split into two tubes and
only one tube received the enzyme. The remaining tube served as a
control for the polymerase chain reaction amplification (PCR, see
below).

Polymerase chain reaction amplification ofgenomic DNA and synthesized cDNA. Aliquots of fibroblast DNA and synthesized cDNA
served as templates for the PCR amplification (18). Sequence for the
oligonucleotide primers was derived from sequencing appropriate
portions of COLIAl cDNA Hf677 and from published sequence information (12). One Mg each of the appropriate HPLC-purified oligonucleotide primers was used per reaction, and conditions were those
specified in the Perkin Elmer Cetus DNA amplification kit (Perkin
Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT), except that a final concentration of 400
MM ofeach deoxynucleotide triphosphate was used instead of200 MM.
For amplification of genomic DNA, both primers were complementary to sequences in exon 52; their sequences are A: 5' CTGGGGCAAGACAGTGATTGAATAC 3', B: 5' CAGTTTGGGTTGCTTGTCTGTTTCCG 3'. For amplification of cDNA, primer B and a new
upstream primer (C), complementary to sequences in exon 51 were
used; the sequence of C is: 5' CAACAGCCGCTTCACCTACAGCGTC 3' (see Fig. 8). After the PCR, aliquots were separated on a 6%
polyacrylamide gel to assess the reaction products.
Cloning ofamplified genomic DNA and DNA sequence determination. Amplified genomic DNA was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis in 2% low-melting-point agarose, and the 213-bp fragment
was resected and purified (19). The isolated material was cleaved with
Cla I and Msp I (New England BioLabs, Inc.) according to manufacturer's specifications, to yield a 13 1-bp fragment. 24 ng of cleaved
DNA was ligated into the Acc I site of 100 ng of Ml3mp9, singlestranded DNA was isolated (20), and DNA sequence determined by
the dideoxy chain-termination method (21). Confirmation of published sequence was determined after subcloning a fragment of
COLIAI cDNA Hf677 into Ml 3mp9, and a fragment of genomic
clone CG103 into Ml 3mp8 (12, 22).
Cell-free translation ofmRNA. 10Mg oftotal cellular RNA was used
for in vitro translation in a methionine minus rabbit reticulocyte lysate
(Promega) (23). Reaction conditions were as specified in the Promega
kit except that 500 MCi of [3H]proline per sample was used as the
radioactive label. All reactions were carried out at 26°C for 90 min.
Each sample was subsequently divided into three equal aliquots and
the newly synthesized proteins were precipitated with an equal volume
of saturated ammonium sulfate at 4°C. Pelleted proteins from two
aliquots were each resuspended in 80 mM CaCI2, 8 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.4, 160 mM N-ethylmaleimide, and 1.6 mM PMSF. Proteins in one of
the two samples were digested with 1.5 U of bacterial collagenase (24)
(Clostridium histolyticum; Advance Biofactures Corp., Lynbrook,
NY) for 4 h at 37°C before analysis of the synthesized proteins by
SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the third aliquot were separated by SDSPAGE in 5% acrylamide gels and subsequently digested in the gels with
CNBr (9). The peptides were separated in a 12.5% acrylamide gel.

Results
Dermal fibroblasts from affected individuals synthesize decreased amounts of type I collagen. We analyzed [3H]prolinelabeled procollagens synthesized by dermal fibroblasts from
four affected and from one normal family member by SDSPAGE (Fig. 1). Cells from the unaffected control synthesized
and secreted normal amounts of proa l(I), with the expected
2:1 ratio of proal(I):proa2(I). There was a 3:1 ratio of
proa 1 (I):proa 1(III). In contrast, cells from affected family
members secreted about half the expected amount of type I
collagen. The secreted type I procollagen was normal and contained proa I(I) and proa2(I) chains in the expected 2:1 ratio.
The ratio of proal(I):proal(III) was about 1:1. There was no
evidence of excessive posttranslational lysyl hydroxylation or
hydroxylysyl glycosylation (overmodification) or retention of
aberrant material within the cell (Fig. 1 B), as is typically observed in more severe forms of 01 (10, 25-28).

Identification of a disrupted intragenic Eco RI site in one
COLIA allele in affected family members. The COLl Al
gene, except for the portion that encodes the carboxyl-terminal
12 amino acids and the 3' untranslated region, is contained
within a 22.6-kb Eco RI fragment, which is useful for assessing
gene size and structural integrity (13). We analyzed Eco RI
digests of genomic DNA from nine available family members
(Fig. 2). In the digests from the four clinically normal individuals, the probe, a 1.4-kb fragment of COLlA1 cDNA Hf677
(labeled probe A in Fig. 2), recognized only a single fragment
of 22.6 kb, while fragments of 22.6 kb and 28.3 kb were
recognized by the probe in the digests from the five affected
individuals. This indicated that all of the family members with
OI had one normal COLlA1 allele and another from which
one of the intragenic Eco RI sites was missing. To determine
which restriction site was altered, the same Southern blot was
stripped of probe A and rehybridized separately with a 5-kb
genomic fragment from the 5' end of the gene (data not
shown), and with a 300-bp fragment of cDNA Hf677 that
extends 3' from the intragenic carboxy-terminal Eco RI restriction site (Fig. 2 B). The latter probe (labeled probe B in Fig. 2)
identified only the 28.3-kb fragment in the affected individuals, confirming that the 3' Eco RI site was missing in their
DNA. All family members had a 5.7-kb fragment recognized
by probe B.
Identification of the mutation in one COLIAJ allele. To
-

sequence across the site of mutation in the normal and mutant
alleles, we used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify a
21 3-bp fragment of genomic DNA in the domain containing
the relevant Eco RI restriction site (Fig. 3) from an affected
individual (III-I) and from a normal family member (II-3). To
confirm that we had successfully amplified the appropriate
fragment, we digested the DNA from both individuals with
Eco RI (Fig. 3). As expected, the amplified material from the
normal family member yielded only fragments of 118 and 95
bp, while material from the affected individual produced the
118- and 95-bp fragments as well as the full-length 213-bp
fragment. The smaller fragments are derived from the normal
allele, while the uncleaved fragment is the product of the mu-

tant allele.

In addition to the full-length amplified material and the
restriction products, we observed two more slowly migrating

bands present only in amplified DNA from the affected individuals (only data from III-1 are shown). We used both restriction endonuclease mapping and denaturation-renaturation
studies to show that these bands represent heteroduplexes
formed between the products of the mutant and normal alleles. For the restriction mapping, DNA was purified from
both bands of slower mobility and cleaved with different restriction endonucleases. In each case, the fragments generated
were identical to those seen with cleavage of DNA isolated
from the 21 3-bp fragment (data not shown), except that there
was no cleavage with Eco RI. We reproduced the more slowly
migrating bands by denaturing DNA isolated from the 21 3-bp
fragment (a mixture of DNA from the normal and mutant
alleles) and allowing these fragments to renature before electrophoresis. Finally, denaturation and renaturation of DNA
isolated from the slowly migrating bands yielded the 213 bp
band (Cohn, D. H., unpublished observations). The reason for
the anomolous mobilities of the heteroduplexes is unknown,
but presumably it reflects some secondary structure created by
the hybridization of sense and anti-sense strands of different
alleles, one of which has a mutation.
Taking advantage of natural restriction sites within the
amplified 213-bp fragment, we cloned a 13 1-bp Cla I-Msp I
fragment from III- 1 into Ml 3 and determined the nucleotide
sequence across the region ofthe Eco RI site in the mutant and

Figure 3. Strategy used to isolate, clone, and sequence the normal
and mutant alleles in the domain containing the Eco RI site. Using
the polymerase chain reaction, we amplified a 21 3-bp fragment of
genomic DNA from II-3 (C) and a similar fragment from III-I (01).
Amplified material from each individual was digested with Eco RI.
Positions of molecular size markers from bacteriophage DNA digested with Pst I are indicated down the left side of the figure. We
cloned the normal and mutant ClaI-MspI fragments from III-I into

the location of the Eco RI restriction site within the amplified fragment.

normal alleles (Fig. 4). The sequence from both alleles was
identical, except that the mutant allele had a 5-bp deletion at
the Eco RI site, creating a shift in the translational readingframe of the protein beginning at the Eco RI site. The 21 3-bp
band seen in Fig. 3, therefore, represents a mixture of 213- and
208-bp fragments derived from the normal and mutant alleles,
respectively, and the heteroduplexes are formed by the annealing of sense and anti-sense strands of the normal and deletion allele. We have observed this same phenomenon with
two other COLlAl deletions (Wallis, G., P. H. Byers, C.
Pruchno, and P. H. Byers, unpublished observations).
The nucleotide sequence of the mutant allele predicts a
protein that extends 84 amino acids beyond the normal termination signal (Fig. 5). The nucleotide sequence corresponding
to the extended proal(I) chain was determined by sequencing
appropriate portions of COLlAl cDNA Hf677 (12), and genomic clone CG103 (13, 22). The new termination signal lies
within the first canonical polyadenylation signal in the
COLlA 1 gene and immediately follows a 22-bp stretch of
adenosine nucleotides. Of the 84 amino acid residues in the
predicted proal(I) extension, 14 are lysine residues and 10 of
these lysines are contained within the last 19 amino acid residues, making the carboxyl-terminal portion of the protein
highly charged.
The search for the predicted protein. We used short-pulse
experiments and in vitro translation to identify the protein
product of the mutant allele. For short pulse studies, fibro-

blasts from one unaffected and four affected individuals were
labeled for periods of 1-20 min with [3H]proline. Cells from
the normal individual synthesized proa I(I) and proa2(I)
chains in the expected 2:1 ratio. In contrast, fibroblasts from
the 01 individuals synthesized less proa I(I) than the normal
cells at each time point, and in fact, exhibited closer to a 1:2
synthetic ratio of proal(I):proa2(I) (Fig. 6; only data from
III-1 and II-4 are shown). The alteration in synthetic ratio was
also observed in labeling periods of < 5 min (data not shown).
In addition, cells from affected individuals appeared to produce larger amounts of proa I (III) than the normal cells.
To identify the material migrating in the position of
proal(III), we digested [3H]proline-labeled proa chains separated in the first dimension by SDS-PAGE, with cyanogen
bromide and separated the resultant peptides in a second dimension gel (Fig. 8 C). Only the normal type III collagen
peptide pattern was observed, whether this was carried out on
procollagens synthesized during pulses of 5-15 min, or on
procollagens produced in 20-h labelings (data not shown). Because the predicted proa 1 (I) chain contains two new cysteine
residues we also performed CNBr peptide mapping on [35S]cysteine-labeled procollagens. Although we expected a [35S]cysteine-labeled fragment from the aberrant proal(I) chain
that would migrate slightly faster than a I(I)CB3, we were unable to detect such a peptide (data not shown). The short-pulse
data argue that the protein product of the mutant allele is
either not synthesized or is rapidly degraded. Alternatively, the
mutation while having its primary effect on translation termination may have a secondary effect on mRNA metabolism

Figure 5. Nucleotide and protein sequences from the product of the normal allele and predicted sequence from the mutant allele. The 5-bp deletion (underlined in the top row of the figure) results in a frame-shift that predicts a protein which extends beyond the normal termination signal by 84 amino acid residues. The new reading-frame is indicated by the solid bar beginning at the Eco RI site. Nucleotide sequence was determined for the mutant and normal allele for nucleotides labeled 1-131 in the figure. Sequence data for the predicted protein was determined by
sequencing a subclone of COLIAI cDNA Hf677 that started at the Eco RI site, and extended to the end of the cDNA (nucleotides 40-303 in
the figure). The remaining nucleotide sequence was determined by sequencing a subclone of COLlA I genomic clone CG 103 (nucleotides
40-359). Our nucleotide sequence data differ from the published sequence in several places. Nucleotide 96 is deoxycytosine in both the normal
and 01 alleles and in Hf677 from our sequence determination, instead of deoxythymidine (nucleotide 57, Fig. 4, clone d, reference 12). Immediately after residue 135 we found a run of three deoxyadenosine nucleotides instead of the two reported in Hf677 (nucleotides 97-99, Fig. 4,
clone d, reference 12). In addition we found a polymorphism at nucleotide 166; the sequence in cDNA Hf677 is deoxythymidine (12), which
we confirmed, while genomic clone CG 103 has deoxycytosine at this position. Finally, we found a stretch of 22 deoxyadenosine nucleotides before the new termination signal (nucleotides 304-325), while the published sequence indicates a 19 base-pair stretch (nucleotides 225-243 in

To investigate the stability of the mRNA from the mutant
allele, we synthesized COLlAl cDNAs from total, nuclear,
and cytoplasmic fibroblast RNA from affected and normal
family members, and used the polymerase chain reaction to
amplify this material. We reasoned that if mRNA from both
the normal and mutant alleles is present, we should detect
heteroduplexes formed between the amplification products of
the two alleles. To eliminate the possibility of contamination
of RNA with genomic DNA that might amplify, we selected a
5' primer that is located in the exon immediately upstream of
the one that contains the Eco RI site. This meant that any
contaminating genomic DNA that amplified would contain

intronic sequence and thus be distinguished by size from amplified cDNA. Amplified cDNA produced separately from
total cellular RNA from four affected individuals exhibited the
characteristic heteroduplexes formed between the products of
the normal and mutant alleles, while amplified cDNA from
the normal family member produced only a single band of 269
bp (Fig. 7 A). Although these results confirm that mRNA is
transcribed from the mutant COLlA 1 allele in affected individuals, they do not allow us to determine if it is transported to
the cytoplasm and available for translation. To this end, we
amplified cDNAs derived from both nuclear and cytoplasmic
RNA from two affected and one normal family member (Fig.
7 B). As expected, the amplified cDNAs synthesized from nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA from the normal family
member each yielded the expected 269-bp fragment. In addition, we observed the characteristic heteroduplexes in the amplified cDNAs derived from both nuclear and cytoplasmic
mRNA from affected family members. These data argue that
transport of the mutant COLIA I mRNA from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm and mRNA steady-state levels in the cytoplasm
are probably not substantially different from those of the normal mRNA, but we cannot rule out the possibility of crosscontamination of RNAs from the two compartments during

purification.
Although we were unable to detect the aberrant proa 1(I)
chain in cells, our cDNA amplification data suggested that the
mRNA from the mutant COLIA I allele was potentially available for translation. To investigate the ability of this mRNA to

direct translation in vitro, we translated mRNA in a cell-free
rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 8 A). Aliquots of each in vitro
translation reaction were treated with bacterial collagenase to
aid in the identification of collagenous proteins. The mRNA
from the unrelated controls (data not shown) and the unaffected family member directs the production of proal(I) and
proa2(I), with a synthetic ratio of roughly 2:1 (Fig. 8 A). The
mRNA derived from the 01 cells also directs the synthesis of
proa l(I) and proa2(I), but the synthetic ratios are abnormal
and resemble those seen in the short-pulse experiments. In
addition, we observed a collagenous species migrating more
slowly than the normal proa l(I) that was not observed in the
short-pulse labelings. Cyanogen bromide peptide mapping of
this chain indicated that it was a proa l(I) species (Fig. 8 B).
These data confirm that the mRNA derived from the mutant
COLlAl allele can be translated, and suggest that our inability
to detect the aberrant proal (I) chain in cells reflects the presence of an unstable, rapidly degraded protein rather than a
block in translation.
The decrease in type I procollagen production by cells from
affected members in this family is correlated with remarkable
alterations in collagen fibril morphology in their skin (29).
Skin from the three affected individuals 1-2, II-2 and I14 have
large numbers of composite fibril structures in dermis, similar
to those seen in skin from individuals with several forms of
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (29).

Discussion
Investigation into the biochemical and molecular basis of 01
indicates that it is a heterogeneous disorder. Structural alterations and point mutations within the coding region of either
COLlAl or COLlA2 are known to produce the more severe

forms of 01 (25). In most cases, dermal fibroblasts from affected individuals synthesize normal molecules and, in addition, structurally abnormal collagens that are overmodified,
thermally unstable, and inefficiently secreted (25-28, 30-33).
In contrast, fibroblasts from most patients with 01 type I produce and efficiently secrete about half the expected amount of
structurally normal type I collagen (4-6), and little is known
about the nature of these mutations.
All affected members of this three generation family have a
5-bp deletion near the 3' end of one COLlAl allele that produces a shift in the translational reading-frame and predicts a
protein that extends beyond the normal termination signal by
84 amino acid residues. Although we are able to detect the
aberrant proa I(I) chain in an in vitro translation assay, we find
no evidence of it in vivo suggesting that ifit is translated within
the cell, it must have a very short half-life because even in the
shortest pulse-label experiments (1 min), we cannot identify
the aberrant protein.
The mRNA from the mutant allele appears to be processed
and transported to the cytoplasm and thus potentially available for translation. What effect the translation of stretches of
mRNA that normally remain untranslated has on mRNA and
protein stability is unclear. Work on elongated globin variants
(34-38) and phage and ribosomal RNAs (39, 40) suggests that
these regions of mRNA may be essential for its stability or
functional integrity, perhaps by forming loops that protect it
from hydrolytic attack by 3' exonucleases. If mRNA secondary
structure is disturbed in order for the elongated portion of the
chain to be translated, the mRNA may become more susceptible to degradation. Alternatively, the unfolding process itself
may impose a restraint upon elongation and alter the overall
stoichiometry of translation. The elongated proa 1(I) chain described in this paper is much longer than any of the aberrant
globin proteins (41) and any secondary structure generated by
the 3' untranslated region would be altered during translation
of this long extension. If mRNA secondary structure plays a
role here however, it may be to affect translation rather than
mRNA stability, as the product of the mutant allele appears to
have a stability comparable to that of the normal, judging from
availability for reverse transcription and amplification.
After chain assembly, procollagen molecules follow the
RER-Golgi-secretory vesicle route to the extracellular matrix
(42). How the cell determines the destiny of aberrant proteins
is unclear. From our data we cannot determine whether the
abnormal proa I(I) is not synthesized within cells, or is rapidly
destroyed in the lumen of the RER or elsewhere along the
secretory pathway. The elongated protein may become
trapped within the RER membrane and rapidly degraded,
never entering the secretory pathway. Interestingly, the predicted protein sequence has a highly basic carboxyl-terminus
similar to some nuclear targeting sequences (43), and of such
density that it could act as a "stop-transfer" signal to block the
final extrusion into the RER lumen (44).
The fate of free proa2(I) chains is also unknown, but we
think it is unlikely that these normal chains will form heterotrimers with the elongated proa I(I) chains because the 84
amino acid extension would make interaction at the carboxyltermini impossible. Accumulating evidence indicates that different pathways are used for handling normal versus aberrant
protein chains, as well as partially or incorrectly assembled
molecules (45-51). Thus, it is not unreasonable to think that
different cell sorting mechanisms target free proa2(I) and abnormal proa 1(I) chains for different degradative routes.

The persistence of structurally abnormal procollagen molecules inside the cell with variable secretion into the extracellular matrix is the biochemical hallmark of the more severe 01
phenotypes, while decreased production of structurally normal
type I -collagen appears to be the hallmark of the OI type I
phenotype. We suggest that having a "null allele" results in a
milder phenotype because abnormal procollagen molecules
are not generally secreted outside the cell and incorporated
into the extracellular matrix.
The effect on the matrix of producing less type I procollagen than normal appears to be dramatic as judged by alteration
in fibril biogenesis (29). We are uncertain why the effects are so
striking but they may simply represent altered ratios of collagens and proteoglycan molecules in the extracellular environment. The production of other matrix components, including
a variety of proteoglycan molecules, by these cells appears to
be unaltered (Vogel, K., unpublished data and personal communication).
Although all affected members of the family described here
have the same mutation, there is considerable intrafamilial
clinical variability. We wondered if there might be subtle biochemical differences between family members with respect to
the amount of abnormal proa I(I) produced or its intracellular
fate, but no differences were observed. In reviewing the clinical
findings, we noticed that the more severely affected family
members (1-2 and 1I-4) had children with both mild and severe
phenotypes, while the mildly affected individual (II-2) had an
offspring with a mild phenotype. This suggests that there might
be some other factor (not identified) segregating independently
in this family that acts to modulate the final phenotype.
The mutation described in this paper is unique among
mutations producing 01 that we have examined. A similar
mutation in the COLlA2 gene results in synthesis of a
proa2(I) chain that is of normal size but has a different end
(52). That proa chain is not incorporated into molecules but is
identified within cells (53).
Although the nature of mutations responsible for OI type I
is largely unknown, structural alterations (5) and point mutations in (54, 55) or near the triple helical coding region (56-58)
appear to be rare causes. Mutations that could alter the apparent expression of COL IA I and lead to decreased type I collagen synthesis include deletion of one allele or structural rearrangements that create a nonfunctional allele, promoter and
enhancer mutations, splicing mutations, small deletions and
insertions that create a shift in the reading frame of the protein,
and single nucleotide substitutions that result in premature
termination codons. We suspect that there is etiologic heterogeneity within the 01 type I phenotype and that many different
mechanisms, both at the gene and protein level can act to
ultimately reduce the secretion of type I collagen and produce
01 type I.
