A sister and brother with severe porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase deficiency are described. Each of their parents carries a different mutation for acute intermittent porphyria and the children are homozygous for the PBG-deaminase deficiency that causes this disorder. Both are compound heterozygotes for adjacent base transitions in the same codon in exon 10 of the PBG deaminase gene.
