Summary. A sister and b r o t h e r with severe porphobilin o g e n ( P B G ) d e a m i n a s e deficiency are described. E a c h
of their parents carries a different m u t a t i o n for acute intermittent p o r p h y r i a and the children are h o m o z y g o u s
for the P B G - d e a m i n a s e deficiency that causes this disorder. B o t h are c o m p o u n d h e t e r o z y g o t e s for adjacent base
transitions in the same c o d o n in exon 10 of the P B G
d e a m i n a s e gene.

Introduction
A c u t e intermittent porphyria ( A I P ) is an autosomal dominant condition characterised by episodic attacks of neurovisceral dysfunction that results f r o m partial deficiency
of p o r p h o b i l i n o g e n ( P B G ) deaminase, the third e n z y m e
of the h a e m biosynthetic pathway. A l t h o u g h it is the
c o m m o n e s t type of acute hepatic porphyria, it was, until
recently, the only f o r m of a u t o s o m a l d o m i n a n t hepatic
porphyria for which a h o m o z y g o u s (or c o m p o u n d heterozygous) individual had not b e e n identified ( N o r d m a n n
and D e y b a c h 1990). In 1990, a mentally r e t a r d e d D u t c h
girl w h o had an unusual f o r m of p o r p h y r i a and who died
at the age of eight in 1964 was retrospectively diagnosed,
t h r o u g h study of her parents, as h o m o z y g o u s A I P (Beukeveld et al. 1990). Analysis of g e n o m i c D N A f r o m her
parents suggested that she was a c o m p o u n d heterozygote, since each p a r e n t had a different m u t a t i o n in exon
10 o f the P B G deaminase gene (Picat et al. 1990), b o t h
mutations having previously b e e n shown to cause crossreactive immunological material ( C R I M ) - p o s i t i v e forms
of A l P (Delfau et al. 1990). W e n o w describe the first
patients in w h o m it has b e e n possible to establish this
diagnosis directly.

ataxia, intention tremor and dysarthria secondary to partial agenesis
of the cerebellar vermis, bilateral cataracts and right optic nerve
hypoplasia. Routine laboratory investigations were normal, apart
from a slight increase in serum asparatate transaminase activity.
Haemoglobin was 12.8 g/dl. Ward investigations revealed a strongly
positive urine test for urobilinogen (Multistix, Ames, Stoke Poges,
UK); this was shown to be caused by excessive excretion of PBG
(564 ~tmol/1); normal subjects: 0-8.8 gmol/1). Faecal porphyrin
excretion was normal. Erythrocyte PBG deaminase activity was
6nmol/h per ml (normal subjects: 30-67nmot/h per ml; mean
42 nmol/h per ml). When assessed one year later, she had had no
further convulsions or symptoms of acute porphyria.
Her brother was born three weeks after his sister was found to
have severe PBG deaminase deficiency. At birth, he weighed
3.405 kg; no cataracts or other abnormalities were detected and cerebral ultrasound was normal. Urine collected soon after birth
contained 79 ~tmol/l PBG and his erythrocyte PBG-deaminase activity was 7 nmol/h per ml. Urinary PBG excretion ranged from
25 gmol/1 to 98 gmol/1 during the subsequent six weeks. He is now
18 months old and developmental progress has been normal.
Their parents were unrelated. Neither had any clinical history
of AIP but both had decreased erythrocyte PBG deaminase activities (27nmol/h per ml and 21 nmol/h per ml, respectively) and
increased urinary PBG excretion (33 p.mol/l and 180 ~tmol/l, respectively) with normal faecal porphyrin excretion, confirming
that each had latent AIP. Immunochemical measurements (Llewellyn et al. 1987) showed that the enzyme defect in both parents
and their children was CRIM-positive, the concentration of immunoreactive enzyme in erythrocytes from all four individuals
being between 177% and 228% of the mean normal concentration.

Materials and methods
M o l e c u l a r studies

DNA was isolated from whole blood from each child and from
their parents. Two synthetic primers 5'-AACCGCACGAGGCCCCAGATI~GCC-3' and 5'-CTGCCCCACCCGGTTGTGCCAGCCC-3' were used in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify a
174-bp fragment of genomic DNA containing exon 10 of the PBG
deaminase gene.

Case reports
A 3-year-old girl was admitted to hospital following febrile convulsions. At about the age of 18 months, she had been found to have

cent C---~T and G--~A transitions in the same codon;
these mutations convert arginine to tryptophan and glutamine, respectively (Fig. 1), and are at positions 499
and 500 in the non-erythroid c D N A for P B G deaminase.
Each parent was heterozygous for either one or other of
these mutations.

Discussion
The G---~A transition at position 500 was present in one
parent of the Dutch patient (Picat et al. 1990) and is
known to produce A I P (Delfau et al. 1990). The C ~ T
transition at position 499 has not been described before
and was not present in 3 other unrelated patients with
the CRIM-positive form of A I P that we investigated by
direct sequencing of amplified genomic D N A (unpublished data). However, replacement of arginine by glutamine (Delfau et al. 1990) or leucine (Lander et al.
1991) at this position in the enzyme produces a profound
decrease in activity; it thus seems likely that tryptophan
would do the same, although this remains to be established.
Induction of PBG deaminase is an early tissue-specific event during erythroid differentiation (Kappas et al.
1989). In hepatocytes, the basal activity of P B G deaminase is lower than that of all other enzymes of the pathway except the rate-controlling enzyme, 5-amino-laevulinate synthase, and readily becomes secondarily ratelimiting in the acute hepatic porphyrias (Kappas et al.
1989). It is therefore remarkable that our patients show
no clinical evidence of haem deficiency or symptoms of
acute porphyria, although, as in other homozygous porphyrias (Kordac et al. 1985), erythrocyte protoporphyrin
concentration was increased (7.21amol/1; normal subjects: 0.4-1.7 lamol/1).
The relationship between severe PBG deaminase deficiency and the neurological defects in our older pa-

tient, in the patient described by Beukeveld et al. (1990)
and in another child (Gregor et al. 1977) who had convulsions and bilateral cataracts and who, in retrospect,
may have had homozygous A I P is uncertain. In view of
the absence of any abnormalities in our patient's younger
brother, it seems possible that the association is coincidental and that hospitalization drew attention to the
metabolic abnormality. The prognosis for our patients is
difficult to assess. With avoidance of precipitants of
acute porphyria, particularly drugs, they may continue
to be asymptomatic, although their susceptibility to develop acute attacks is likely to increase at puberty, as
happens in heterozygous A I P (Kappas et al. 1989). The
absence of reports of adults with comparably low PBG
deaminase activities may reflect both the rarity of homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for those mutations
that decrease but that do not abolish enzyme activity,
and the infrequency of PBG deaminase measurements in
A I P until recently, rather than a failure to survive to
adulthood.
