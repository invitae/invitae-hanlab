abnormal factor XII proteins from the plasma of an individual
with CRM' Hageman trait (factor XII Washington D.C.) has
been isolated and partially characterized (14). This abnormal
factor XII has the following properties: (i) it has the same
molecular weight as normal factor XII, (ii) it shows no
clot-promoting activity but does show the same specific
antigenicity as purified normal factor XII in immunoassay,
(iii) limited proteolysis of the abnormal factor XII exposed to
a mixture of plasma and glass yields a two-chain a-XIIa with
normal-sized heavy and light chains, and (iv) this abnormal
factor XII is fragmented by trypsin in the same way as normal
factor XII, but no prekallikrein-activating activity and no
incorporation of [3H]diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate into a
catalytic domain are observed. These results suggest that the
abnormality in this enzyme resides at or near the active-site
triad of the molecule.
The present study was undertaken to further elucidate the
structural abnormality of factor XII Washington D.C. that
would account for the functional impairment of the molecule.
The results indicate that the impairment of the serine protease activity is due to replacement of Cys-571 with serine in
the catalytic domain.

Structural studies on a congenital abnormal
ABSTRACT
coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor), factor XII Washington D.C., have been performed to identify the defect responsible for its lack of procoagulant activity. Amino acid sequence
analysis of a tryptic peptide isolated from the abnormal factor
XII indicated that Cys-571 (equivalent to Cys-220 in the
chymotrypsin numbering system) had been replaced by serine.
No other substitutions in the active-site triad-namely, His393, Asp-442, and Ser-544-were found. We propose that the
Cys-571 -* Ser replacement found in this factor XII variant
destroys the formation of the disulfide linkage between Cys-540
and Cys-571, giving rise to an altered conformation of the
active-site serine residue or the secondary substrate-binding
site and, thus, leads to the loss of enzyme activity.
Coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor) is a plasma protein
that was originally found as a functionally deficient agent in
plasmas from individuals with Hageman trait (1). Under
certain conditions, this protein appears to initiate several host
defense plasma reactions, including blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and kinin generation (2-4). Human factor XII is a
zymogen of a serine protease with an approximate Mr of
80,000 and consists of a single-chain glycoprotein composed
of 596 amino acid residues (5-9). When normal blood comes
into contact with negatively charged surfaces, such as glass,
kaolin, dextran sulfate, and sulfatide, factor XII is bound to
the surface and converted to an active enzyme (factor XIIa)
by a complex reaction involving plasma prekallikrein and
high-molecular-weight kininogen (2-4, 10-12). Factor XII
undergoes, on the surface, specific limited proteolysis by
kallikrein and transforms into two active enzyme forms,
a-factor XIIa (a-XIIa) and 8-factor XIIa (,B-XIIa). a-XIIa is
composed of two polypeptide chains with Mr values of 52,000
and 28,000, whereas ,B-XIIa consists of two chains with Mr
values of 2,000 and 28,000 (5). The heavy chain of a-XIIa is
composed of 353 amino acid residues and contains four
different domains (6, 7). The light chain of a-XIIa is a
catalytic domain with 243 amino acid residues that contains
the active-site triad of serine protease (5, 7).
The plasma of the majority of subjects with Hageman trait
also lacks immunologically identifiable factor XII. Very rare
individuals with this disorder, however, whose plasma contains nearly normal amounts of nonfunctional but immunologically identifiable factor XII, have been reported (13-15).
Because these plasmas contain cross-reacting material
(CRM) recognized by the specific antiserum, these cases
have been called CRM+ (CRM-positive) variant. Studies of
the nonfunctional factor XII in CRM+ Hageman trait may
provide a unique opportunity to examine the structurefunction relationship of this plasma protein. One of the

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of Abnormal Factor XII and Its p-XII. Plasmas
from an individual with CRM' Hageman trait (14) were
obtained, after informed consent, by plasmapheresis, using
acid/citrate/dextrose anticoagulant. Factor XII was purified
according to a published method (16) from plasma samples of
this individual and from normal individuals that served as a
control. Normal factor XII was a gift from Kazuo Fujikawa
(University of Washington, Seattle). The normal factor XII
and abnormal factor XII were treated by trypsin, and the
resulting 83-XII was isolated by a DEAE-Sephacel column (5).
The 8-XII samples thus prepared were reduced and Spyridylethylated (17).
Tryptic Peptide Mapping by HPLC. The S-pyridylethylated
abnormal 83-XII (320 gg) and normal /3-XII (210 Ag) were
suspended separately in 20 ,ul of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0/8
M urea. After dilution with 60 ,ul of 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.0,
20 ,l of trypsin (0.35 mg/ml) was added, and the digestion
was performed at 37°C for 14 hr. Each digest was chromatographed on a reversed-phase C4 column (0.46 x 15 cm,
Cosmosil 5C4-300; Nakarai Chemical, Kyoto) on a Beckman
model 344 HPLC system. HPLC separation of the digest was
performed with a linear gradient of 0-42% (vol/vol) acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 84 min and 42-60%
acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 9 min at a flow rate
of 0.5 ml/min. The effluent was monitored by measuring

RESULTS
Tryptic Peptide Mapping of Abnormal and Normal ,-XII.
The S-pyridylethylated 83-XII derived from abnormal and
normal factor XII were each digested with trypsin, and the
resulting peptides were separated on a reversed-phase C4
column (Fig. 1). A peak eluted at 21.3 min appeared to be
4-vinylpyridine used for the S-alkylation ofthe ,3-XII because
this peak did not contain any amino acids in the HCI
hydrolysate. Except for the peaks eluted at 4.5 min (Figs. 1
A and B), 54.0 min and 67.8 min (Fig. 1A), and 45.9 min (Fig.
1B), all peptides from both samples were obtained as a single
peptide. The impure peptides were purified further by rechromatography as described, and the purified peptides were
subjected to further analyses. The two chromatograms in Fig.
1 differ in some ways. Three peptides eluted at the retention
time of 35.4 min (T1OC), 50.7 min (T12'), and 60.9 min (T9N)
appeared only in the digest of abnormal 83-XII (Fig. 1B), and
also the heights of three peptide peaks eluted at the retention
time of 40.5 min (T2C-3), 62.1 min (T2), and 66.0 min (T9)
were greater than those of the digest of the normal control.
Most differences between the two chromatograms in Fig. 1,
except for peptide T12', could be explained mainly by uneven
digestion of S-pyridylethylated f-XII by trypsin. In the
abnormal molecule, complete cleavage of the Arg474-Pro-475 bond was seen, which yielded the peptides T8
and T9, whereas the extent of this cleavage was fairly
reduced in the normal molecule. In addition, peptide bonds
of Arg-398-Pro-399, His-393-Cys-394, Tyr-462-Val-463,
Phe-507-Leu-508, and Met-527-Leu-528 were partially
cleaved by trypsin in the abnormal molecule, generating the
peptides T2, T2C-3, T8N, T9N, and T10C. One clear difference between A and B of Fig. 1 was the appearance of peptide
T12' in the chromatogram from the abnormal molecule.
Amino Acid Composition of Tryptic Peptides Derived from
Abnormal f-XII. Table 1 shows the amino acid compositions
of all tryptic peptides derived from abnormal B-XII. Peptides
were numbered sequentially from the NH2 terminus of the
catalytic domain of factor XII. The data indicated a high
purity of all peptides and allowed unambiguous identification
of their positions in the known amino acid sequence for the
catalytic domain of factor XII. Approximately 99% of the
entire amino acid residues of the abnormal j3-XII molecule
was assigned by these analyses. Among these peptides, the
peptides T2-3 and T13-14 contained 2 mol of basic residues
(arginine or lysine) per mol of peptide, and this result is due
to incomplete hydrolyses of the Arg-398-Pro-399 and Lys576-Pro-577 peptide bonds. Two free arginines, Arg-413 (T4)
and Arg-558 (T11), generated in the tryptic digest were not
identified; they might be coeluted in the breakthrough fraction with salts, even in the rechromatography on a reversedphase C18 column (data not shown). The peptide T12 derived
from normal j8-XII consisted of 16 amino acid residues

numbered sequentially from the NH2 terminus of the catalytic

containing one cysteine and two serines, as expected from
the sequence data (6, 7). However, the amino acid composition of peptide T12' derived from the abnormalg3-X11
showed one more seine and one less -pyridylethylcysteine
than that of peptide T12. To determine the basis for this
difference, sequence analysis of the aberrant peptide T12'
was performed.
Amino Acid Sequence of Aberrant Peptide T12'. The sequence of peptide T12' was determined with duplicate samples by automated Edman degradation. As shown in Table 2,
peptide T12' differed from the normal T12 peptide by a single
amino acid at position 571-a cysteine in the normal peptide
and a serine in the abnormal peptide. This result indicates
that a Cys --+ Ser substitution at position 571 has shifted the
retention time from 54 min for the normal peptide T12 to 52.8
min for the aberrant peptide T12'. The Cys --+ Ser substitution
at position 571, on the other hand, has to provide a halfCys-540, because both cysteine residues correspond to the
"&serine disulfide loop" found in chymotrypsin and other
serine proteases. To confirm the free sulfhydryl group at
position 540, abnormalB1-XII was S-pyridylethylated without
any reduction. However, the sample after acid hydrolysis did

digested further with a-chymotrypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by HPLC. The histidine residue (His-57)
in one of these peptides was identified as >PhNCS-His.
Peptide T10, containing the active-site serine residue (Ser195), the side-chain-binding site Asp-189 (in trypsin-like
protease), and the NH2-terminal ion-pair-interacting residue
Asp-194 and consisting of 45 amino acid residues, was
digested with Staphylococcal V8 protease, and the resulting
peptides were separated by HPLC. The serine residue (Ser195) and two aspartate residues (Asp-189 and Asp-194) were
found in one of these peptides and identified by the direct
Edman degradation method (data not shown). Thus, -47% of
the entire amino acid sequences of the abnormal 83-XII
molecule was confirmed by the Edman method.

DISCUSSION

Collectively, the data described thus far make it very unlikely
that the molecular abnormality of factor XII Washington
D.C. is due to replacement of any amino acid residues
associated directly with the active-site catalytic triad or the
substrate-binding pocket. Therefore, the replacement of cysteine by serine at position 571 from the NH2 terminus of
abnormal factor XII appears responsible for the loss of
catalytic activity. Because the genetic codon for Cys-571 has
been determined as TGT (7-9, 20), we concluded that the
patient's genomic DNA encoding for factor XII has a AGT or
TCT nucleotide mutation.
Cys-571 (equivalent to Cys-220 in chymotrypsin) is a highly
conserved amino acid residue among serine proteases, including pancreatic enzymes, blood coagulation factors, fibrinolytic enzymes, and complement factors. A reasonable
assumption from the disulfide location in other serine proteases is that a disulfide linkage between Cys-540 and Cys-571
is formed in factor XII (5, 7). Based on the crystallographic
data for a bovine trypsin-pancreatic trypsin inhibitor com-

FIG. 2. Comparison of the serine disulfide loop of normal factor
XII with that of factor Xll Washington D.C. Cys-571 is replaced by
serine in factor XII Washington D.C. The secondary substratebinding site Ser-Trp-Gly (SWG in one-letter code) is boxed. Cys-540
may have been masked with a mixed disulfide form, such as cysteine
or glutathione.

plex (21), this disulfide bond is exposed on the surface, the
so-called serine disulfide loop, and lies close to the specificity
hole. Therefore, its integrity is probably important for enzyme activity. A comparison of the serine disulfide loop of
normal factor XII with factor XII Washington D.C. is shown
in Fig. 2. This serine disulfide loop contains the active-site
serine residue (Ser-195) and residues Ser-214-Trp-215Gly-216. The peptide backbone of these residues is thought
to interact with the side chains of the substrate to properly
orient the bond that is to be cleaved (22, 23). Therefore, we
propose that the Cys -* Ser substitution found in this factor
XII variant destroys the formation of disulfide linkage between Cys-540 and Cys-571 and may form a mixed disulfide
bond between Cys-540 and a cysteine residue or a glutathione, altering conformation of the active-site serine residue or the secondary substrate-binding site, which leads to
loss of the enzyme activity.
