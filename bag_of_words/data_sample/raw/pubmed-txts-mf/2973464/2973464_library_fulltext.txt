clones shown in this figure were sequenced in their entirety. Dark
bars represent protein-coding sequences, intermediate bars the 5'and 3"untranslated exon sequences, and light bars introns. Details
are described in the text. In all of the three clones which retained
intron 12, there was a single nucleotide transversion of G to C at the
5' donor site of intron 12. The 5' terminus of each clone is indicated
by a nucleotide number under the bar near the terminus. The A of
the initiation codon, ATG, in the normal cDNA is nucleotide 1. Thus,
negative numbers indicate that the 5'terminus of those clones
extended beyond the initiation codon. Clone 9A1 waspolyadenylated

whether or not the exon 12-intron 12 junctional region is
present (intact clones and probes 1 and 2), 2) if so, whether
the region is normal, contains intron 12 with the junctional

sequences (probe 6) indicated that 11 clones contained unexcised intron 12 with the junctional transversion (similar to
Clone 9A1, 4B1, and 7A1), while 11 were missing both exon
12 and intron 12 (similar to Clone 10A1) (Fig. 4, Table I).
There were 12 clones in which integrity of the upstream exons
could be assessed. Seven of them were missing one or more of
upstream exons and five were normal in the region of exons
3-7 (Fig. 5, Table I). Upstream abnormalities occur equally
in clones with retained intron 12 or skipped exon 12.
Three clones were normal in the region of exon 12-13. TWO
of these clones were relatively short but one (15A1) was 3.6kb long. Furthermore, the probes designed to assess integrity
of upstream exons indicated that 15A1 is normal also in the
upstream regions. Because of the potential significance of
Clone 15A1, it was then sequenced in its entirety. The sequence of the 3' half was identical with that of the full-length
normal cDNA precisely from nucleotide -168 to the 3' terminus (pBHa-5) (6). The sequence immediately upstream of
the normal cDNA sequence, however, was not that of the
normal gene (8). This abnormal 1.7-kb upstream sequence
could not be identified with any sequence registered in the
Genbank. A preliminary series of Southern analysis of genomic DNA from several patients failed to give firm evidence
for its association with Tay-Sachs disease. The possibility of
this sequence being an unrelated artifact cannot yet be excluded.

FIG. 3. Strategies for characterization of cDNA clones.
Either probe 1or 2 provides size estimate of clones. Positive hybridization of both probes 1 and 2 indicates that the clone includes the
region of exons 12 and 13. Then the Southern analysis of DdeIdigested clones with probe 6 gives a single 185-bp fragment, if the
clone has normal exons 12 and 13 structure. It gives four smaller
fragments if intron 12 is retained and if thereis the junctional
transversion, which generates a new DdeI site. In practice, the two
smaller fragments (35 and 19 bp) are difficult to visualize. If clones
that are long enough to include the exon 12-13 region do not give
positive DdeI fragments, it indicates absence of exon 12 and intron
12. Hybridization of probes 3-5 to clones double-digested with SacI
and PuuII provides information on the presence or absence of exons
4-7. A positive band for probe 3 assures that the clone extends to
exon 1-3 region. The normal exon structure gives 257-bp (probe 4 )
and 388-bp (probe 5 ) bands. Then, other sizes of fragments that
hybridize to probes 4 and 5 indicatethe presence or absence of either
or both of the SacI sites, and from the known sizes of the exons, as
to which of the upstream exons are missing. The sizes of normal
exons are 66 bp (exon 3), 47 bp (exon 4 ) , 111 bp (exon 5 ) , 102 bp
(exon 6 ) , 133 bp (exon 7), 181 bp (exon S), and 87 bp (exon 9).The
positions of the two SacI sites are 54 bp from the 5' end of exon 3
and 90 bp from the 5' end of exon 6, respectively.

Three laboratories recently described a single-nucleotide
transversion atthe 5' donor site of intron 12 in the Bhexosaminidase a chain in some Ashkenazi Jewish patients
with classical infantile Tay-Sachs disease (13-15). Our data
indicated that the junctional mutation indeed results in defective splicing of the transcripts (15). The
more detailed
characterization of the series of abnormal mRNAs as described in this report show that the consequences of the
junctional transversion are complex and include abnormalities in apparently unrelated remote upstream sequences.
The abnormalities inthe @-hexosaminidasea chain mRNA
in this patient can be categorized into three major groups,
retention of intron 12, skipping of exon 12, and skipping of
one or more of remote exons. The failure to excise intron 12
is themost predictable outcome of the junctional abnormality.
In a recent survey of 1446 exon-intron junctionsranging from
primates to viruses and plants, the first two nucleotides at
the 5' donor site of introns were invariably GT (21). Even
though a few exceptions in which the first two bases were GC
have been reported (22-24), we are notaware of normal exonintron junctions where the first base on the donor side is not
G. Once the 5' donor site is obliterated, the entire intron may
remain unexcised. Alternatively, a portion of the intron may
be spliced out from a 5' donor site consensus sequence present
within the intron to thenormal 3' end of the intron. At least
in one instance, intron 13 was also unexcised but was truncated by polyadenylation due to a polyadenylation signal
within intron 13.
The skipping of exon 12 cannot be interpreted definitively
because these cDNAs do not give direct evidence for the
junctional mutation and because we know that our patient
was a compound heterozygote with only one of the two alleles
carrying the junctional mutation (15). Thus, we cannot logically exclude the possibility that these cDNAs with skipped
exon 12 came from the other allele. We tentatively interpret,
however, that they did derive from the allele with the junctional mutation, because skipping of the exon immediately

FIG. 4. Examples of the Southern analysis of the exon 12-intron 12 region. Clones that gave different
results are selected for this figure. Inserts were excised from the h g t l l vector, electrophoresed without digestion in
1% agarose, blotted, and hybridized to probe 1 (left panel) or probe 2 (middle panel). A clone that includes both
the 5’ and 3’ regions of the normal cDNA should give a positive band of the same size for both probes. Then, the
inserts were digested by DdeI, electrophoresed in 3% Nu-Sieve agarose gel, blotted, and hybridized to probe 6,
which spanned the sequence of exon 12 and 5’ end of intron 12 (right panel). The numbers between the left and
middle panels indicate the positions of the size standards from the HindIII-digested X phage. The numbers of the
right panel are estimated sizes of the threevisible bands. Absence of positive bands indicates missing exon 12 and
intron 12 (skipped exon 12). A single 185-bp band derives from the normal exon 12-exon 13 structure, while two
bands of 85 and 52 bp indicate presence of intron 12 with the junctional transversion. Two other smaller fragments
(35 and 19 bp) are not visualized in this system. Refer to Fig. 3 and Table I for interpretations.

FIG. 5. Integrity of upstream exons. The clones that were
judged long enough to include the regions of exons 3-9 by their length
and positive hybridization to probe 3 were double-digested by Sac1
and PuuII, electrophoresed in 3% Nu-Sieve agarose gel, blotted, and
hybridized to probe 4 (top panel) orprobe 5 (bottom panel). The
numbers on the right side of the panels are estimated sizes of the
fragments. A 257-bp band for probe 4 and a 388-bp band for probe5
indicate the normalupstream exon structure.Refer to Fig. 3 for
criteria for interpretations and Table I for the findings.

the absence of a mutation, when the size of the intron was
close to the minimum size required for normal splicing (26).
If our interpretation is correct, retention of the intron and
skipping of the preceding exon occurs with approximately an
equal frequency as theresult of the junctional mutation.
Skipping of apparently unrelated upstream exons
was found
in the majority of the clones both with retained intron 12 and
skipped exon 12. Thisappearsto occur withoutintrinsic
abnormalities in the upstream region, because at least one
clone (9A1),when sequenced in its entirety, had junctional
the
mutation and a completely normal upstream exon structure.
The number of missing exons ranged from one to four, and
possibly more. Although the mechanism with which the upstream exons are excised is not clear, random degradation of
unstable mRNA is unlikely, because the missing segments
precisely corresponded to individual exons. If these exons are
skipped as the result of the junctional mutation, the finding
is consistent with splicing taking place after transcription is
completed. A remote possibility exists that such mis-splicing
occurs normally at a significant frequency but is not detected
because the resultantmRNA is unstable, while in the mutant
there is an apparent enrichment of such abnormal mRNAs
because other mRNA molecules are also unstable due to the
junctional mutation. We consider the possibility highly unlikely because, judged from the number of clones isolated from
the library, the mutant mRNA may not be as unstable as it
appears on the Northern blotting and because a majority
(7:ll) of the mRNA with the exon 12-intron 12 abnormalities
were also missing upstream exons. Since mRNAs with double

18567

abnormalities (retained intron 12 and missing upstream exons) wouldbe at least as unstable as those with retained
intron 12 only, these findings are inconsistent with missing
upstream exons being an apparent enrichment of normally
occurring mis-splicing, unless more than half of mRNAs are
normally mis-spliced and degraded rapidly to almost undetectable levels.
The three cDNA clones that were normal in the region of
exon 12-intron 12 aroused our interest. Although two were
too short for further meaningful characterization, one was
3.6-kb long, and its 3‘ half was identical with the normal fulllength P-hexosaminidase cy cDNA. The sequence of the upstream 1.7-kb segment did not match the sequence of the
normal gene above exon 1as published by Proia and Soravia
(8).It is tempting tospeculate that these clones derived from
the other abnormal allele and that the “foreign” upstream
sequence might give a clue as to itsabnormality. However, a
preliminary series of experiments so far have failed to show
positive association of this sequence with Tay-Sachs disease.
It is equally possible now that itrepresents an artifacttotally
unrelated to Tay-Sachsdisease or even to p-hexosaminidase
cy chain. If these mRNAs also came from the allele with the
junctional mutation,they suggest that a very small proportion
of precursor mRNA is spliced correctly even in the presence
of the junctional mutation. Patients homozygous with respect
to thesplicing defect could answer some of these uncertainties
but we have not encountered such patients.
