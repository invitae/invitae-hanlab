Summary. Loss of function of both copies of the RB1
gene is a causal event in the development of retinoblastoma. The predisposition to this tumor can be inherited
as an autosomal dominant trait. Direct detection of the
genetic defect is important for presymptomatic D N A
diagnosis and genetic counseling in families with hereditary retinoblastoma. We have used multiplex polymerase
chain reaction and high-resolution polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis to detect RB1 gene deletions as small as
one base pair. By using three independent sets of amplification reactions, which cover 26% of the RB1 gene
coding region, we identified RB1 gene deletions in the
D N A of peripheral blood cells in 3 out of 24 (12.5%) unrelated patients with hereditary retinoblastoma. In one
case, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor material
was also used to detect the mutation. Sequencing of the
mutated alleles revealed deletions of 1, 3 and 10 base
pairs. Each deleted region was flanked by direct repeats.

Introduction
Retinoblastoma is a childhood tumor that arises from
retinal progenitor cells. It is initiated by the loss of both
copies of the RB1 gene, which encodes for a cell cycle
regulatory protein (Cavenee et al. 1983; Friend et al.
1986; Fung et al. 1987; Lee et al. 1987; Buchkovich et al.
1989; DeCaprio et al. 1989). Approximately 40% of patients carry a germline mutation at this locus in all cells
(Vogel 1979). Three quarters of these alterations represent de novo mutations. Tumor formation is initiated by
the somatic loss or inactivation of the second allele on

the homologous chromosome. As somatic mutations are
relatively frequent, these patients often develop multiple
tumor loci in one or both eyes. However, some carriers
develop only one tumor or escape tumor development
completely. In 60% of all retinoblastoma patients, both
alleles are inactivated by somatic mutations in a single
cell. These patients develop only a single tumor focus.
In familial cases, the chromosome carrying the mutated allele can often be identified by segregation analysis with polymorphic D N A markers (Wiggs et al. 1988;
Scheffer et al. 1989; Yandell and Dryja 1989; Goddard
et al. 1990). Because of the high frequency of de novo
mutations, non-penetrance, or lack of informativity in
some families, this indirect approach is often not feasible. Therefore, direct detection of the germline defect
is the method of choice for identifying individuals at risk.
Various deletions, insertions and point mutations at
the RB1 locus have been characterized. Gross structural
alterations as detectable by Southern blot hybridization
are present in only 15% of patients with bilateral retinoblastoma (Kloss et al. 1991). Slightly higher rates have
been found in tumor D N A (Goddard et al. 1988). The
majority of mutations are too small to be detected by
Southern blotting. Small deletions and insertions have
successfully been detected by RNase mismatch analysis
of tumor R N A (Dunn et al. 1988, 1989). Point mutations
can be identified by enzymatic amplification and direct
sequencing of genomic D N A (Yandell et al. 1989). All
the mutations found so far show no preferential localization that would indicate a mutation hot spot in the gene.
Therefore, it is necessary to screen all of the 27 exons
and adjacent intronic sequences. To reduce the labor
involved, we have simultaneously amplified different
regions of the RB1 gene in a single polymerase chain
reaction (multiplex PCR). The products can then be
analyzed by high-resolution gel electrophoresis in order
to detect small length alterations.

same conditions employing a single primer pair. Amplification
from tumor D N A samples was carried out in a 50 gl reaction volume using 20 ~tl of the D N A solution and 40 PCR cycles.

Materials and methods

Patients
Twenty-four unrelated patients with bilateral retinoblastoma were
studied. Diagnosis of retinoblastoma was ascertained by standard
histopathological criteria. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material was available in one case.

DNA isolation
D N A was isolated from whole blood employing standard methods
(Kunkel et al. 1977). D N A from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was prepared as follows. Tumor tissue was scratched
away from a single 5-gm-thick unstained section. The material was
dewaxed with xylene, rinsed with ethanol and vacuum desiccated.
The dried tissue was mixed with 100 gl sterile water and heat-denatured for 8 min at 98~ A sample of 20 lal of this preparation was
sufficient for one amplification reaction.

PCR amplification of DNA
Amplification from whole blood D N A was performed in a total
volume of 25 gl. The reaction mix contained 100 ng genomic DNA,
20nmol each dNTP, 1.25 units Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer,
Norwalk, Conn.) and 10-20pmol of each amplification primer
using standard buffer conditions (10 mM TRIS-HC1 pH 8.3, 50 mM
KC1, 1.5 mM MgCI:, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin). Thermal cycling (denaturing for 1 min at 94~ annealing for 30s at 56-58~ and extension for 30 s at 72~ was performed on an automated thermocycler (Bio-med, Theres, FRG); 35 cycles were preceded by 4min
at 94~ and followed by an additional 4rain at 72~ For screening, three seperate reactions were performed. In each reaction,
three different regions of the RB1 gene sequence were amplified
simultaneously (multiplex-PCR). Primers were chosen from the
sequence reported by Friend et al. (1986) (Table 1). They were
synthesized on a D N A synthesizer (Applied Biosystems 394 D N A /
R N A Synthesizer) and had 5'-extensions containing EcoRI restriction sites. When required, simplex PCR was performed under the

PCR. se, Sense primer; as, antisense primer

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
An aliquot of the reaction mix (1/25) was electrophoresed at 10 V/
cm on a 20 cm long, 0.75 mm thick, 10% polyacrylamide gel (Protean IIxi, Bio-Rad). After 20-36h, the D N A was visualized by
silver-staining (Schumacher et al. 1983). Gels were washed and
fixed twice for 6min in 10% ethanol, 0.5% acetic acid. They were
transferred to a 0.2% AgNO3 staining solution and agitated for
20 min. After washing several times in distilled water, the get was
soaked in 1.5% NaOH, 0.4% formaldehyde (37%) and 0.01%
NaBH4 for 7 min. To stop the developing process, the gels were
transferred to a fixing solution (0.75% Na2CO3).

Sequence analysis
The amplified products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis
on 3% GTG NuSieve (FMC, Rockland, Me.), and recovered with
a 0.45-1Jm filter unit (Ultrafree MC, Millipore, Yonezawa, Japan).
The sequencing reaction was performed with Sequenase 2.0 (USB,
Cleveland, Ohio) using a kinased PCR-primer (Casanova et al. 1990).
For subcloning, amplification products were digested with EcoR1,
purified by gel etectrophoresis in low melting agarose (GTG NuSieve,
FMC, Rockland, Me.) and subcloned into pGEM4z. Plasmid DNA
was recovered from cultures of single colonies. Sequencing was
performed with c~-35SdATP using one of the amplification primers.

a b o u t 26% of the RB1 gene coding region. T h e primers
used here had b e e n designed for the amplification of
c D N A , and did not cover the splice junctions. The surv e y e d regions are listed in Table 2. In 3 out of 24 cases,
we detected P C R products of a b e r r a n t length.

Case 1, family R 6
Analysis of patient C . R . with multiplex reaction no. 2
indicated a small deletion in e x o n 16 of o n e RB1 allele

(Fig. 1). Direct sequencing revealed a deletion of 3 bp.
A l t h o u g h the deletion is not in-frame at the D N A level,
it leads to the in-frame loss of amino acid A s n 4s~ (Fig. 2).
Figure 3 shows the analysis of the patient's family with
simplex amplification of exon 16. T h e affected grandfather (I-1) and his two affected children (11-2, I1-3)
carry the same deletion. T h e patient's father (II-4), alt h o u g h free of retinoblastoma, also carries this deletion.
As he transmitted the disease to his first child (III-1), he
is a n o n - p e n e t r a n t carrier. His second child (111-2) does
not have the deletion.

Case 2, family Fe
In this case multiplex P C R no. 1 indicated a small deletion in exon 20. The affected m o t h e r (I-2) and one of the
twin sisters (II-1) have the same deletion (Fig. 4). Investigation of t u m o r material o b t a i n e d f r o m a single 5-~tmthick section of formalin-fixed and p a r a f f i n - e m b e d d e d

stop c o d o n 30 bp d o w n s t r e a m of the m u t a t i o n site.

Case 3, family Be
Investigation with multiplex P C R no. 3 indicated a deletion in exon 23. The deletion was not detected in the parents (Fig. 5). The P C R product was subcloned into
pGEM4z. Nine individual clones were obtained. Four
clones were sequenced. Two clones contained the wildtype sequence, whereas two showed a deletion of 10bp.

Discussion

Using multiplex P C R and high-resolution P A G E , we
have been able to identify germline mutations in 3 out of
24 patients with bilateral retinoblastoma.
In case 1 (family R6), a deletion of 3 bp in exon 16
leads to the elimination of Asn 48~in the protein. This deletion has not been found in other studies involving 150
unrelated patients. Therefore, it is unlikely that this
deletion is a neutral genetic polymorphism. The deleted
amino acid is part of a region known to interact with the
SV40 T antigen (Huang et al. 1990). However, the function of Asn 48~ in the action of RB1 is unknown. The
patient's family was only partly informative for intragenic polymorphisms (not shown). In particular, the patient's father was homozygous for all available markers,
and prediction testing of the patient's brother was not
possible. By simplex amplification and P A G E analysis,
the deletion was detectable in all affected relatives and
the patient's father. The patient's brother did not inherit
the deletion and hence does not have an increased risk of
developing retinoblastoma. This prediction would also
be correct if the deletion were a neutral polymorphism
marking a mutated allele.
In the second family (family Fe), a 1-bp deletion in
exon 20 was detected in all affected individuals. This
mutation generates a new stop codon 30 bp downstream
from the mutation site. This mutation was reduced to
hemi- or homozygosity in the tumor tissue investigated.
This result demonstrates that formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues also can be used for this form of analysis.
The third patient (family Be) has a 10-bp deletion in
exon 23 leading to a frame shift with a consequent disruption of the primary protein structure. Neither parent
shows this alteration. Therefore, this mutation is a de
novo germline mutation. Unless one of the parents has a
germline mosaicism, the recurrence risk in another child
will not be increased.

All mutations described here are part of, or flanked
by, short direct repeats (Table 3). As a consequence, it
is impossible to define which of the repeated motifs is
deleted. Short direct repeats have also been described
at the breakpoints of large deletions at the RB1 locus
(Canning and Dryja 1989; Gregor et al. 1990; Hashimoto et al. 1991). Until now, this has not been reported
for small deletions at this locus. However, a 3-bp direct
repeat is present at the breakpoints of a 10-bp deletion
(case RB543) reported by D u n n et al, (1989). Recently,
the occurrence of distinctive sequence patterns in the
vicinity of short ( < 20 bp) deletions in different genetic
loci has been investigated (Krawczak and Cooper 1991).
In all but one of the 60 deletions analyzed, direct repeats
of between 2 bp and 8 bp were present.
The goal of the study presented here was to examine
the value of multiplex P C R for the detection of mutations at the RB1 locus. By surveying 26% of the RB1
open reading frame, we detected germline mutations in
3 out of 24 cases. F u r t h e r m o r e , the results presented
here demonstrate the use of this approach for the identification of gene carriers among relatives, for the uncovering of non-penetrance, and for the detection of
de novo germline mutations. The mutation may even be
determined in material obtained from histopathological
specimens. We are currently testing primers that also
allow the amplification of splice junctions. Multiplex
P C R and high-resolution gel electrophoresis may be a
useful approach for the rapid detection of small RB1
mutations.
