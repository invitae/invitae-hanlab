A 7-bp deletion in the X-chromosomal pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) E1 alpha gene was characterized in a female patient with the "cerebral" form of PDH deficiency. The mutation was localized using the chemical cleavage method and further characterized by application of the polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. This 7-bp sequence is found in the normal gene as a direct tandem repeat. The deletion causes a change in the reading frame. Results have shown that the level of normal sized PDH E1 alpha in the fibroblast sample was approximately 30% of that of normal controls. This is consistent with normal transcription from the X chromosome carrying the nonmutated form of the E1 alpha subunit, as this chromosome is active in approximately 30% of this patient's cells. The severity of PDH E1 alpha deficiency in affected females is to a large extent dependent on the X-chromosome inactivation pattern in the brain. The clinical picture might therefore vary significantly between patients with the same mutation. We show that the 7-bp deletion must be a de novo mutation, because it is not present in the parent's X chromosomes. Furthermore, the deletion was not detected in chorionic villus samples in two subsequent pregnancies.
