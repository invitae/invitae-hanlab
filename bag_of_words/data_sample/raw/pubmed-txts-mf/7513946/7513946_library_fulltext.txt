Summary
We have identified three novel mutations in four non-Ashkenazi Italian patients with muscle
phosphofructokinase (PFK-M) deficiency (Tarui disease). Patient 1 was homozygous for an A-to-C substitution
at the 3' end of intron 6 of the PFK-M gene, changing the consensus splice-junction sequence AG to CG. The
mutation leads to activation of two cryptic splice sites in exon 7, resulting in one 5 bp- and one 12 bp-deleted
transcript. An affected brother was also homozygous, and both parents were heterozygous, for the splicejunction mutation. Patient 2 was homozygous for a G-to-C substitution at codon 39, changing an encoded
arginine (CGA) to proline (CCA). Patient 3 was heterozygous for an A-to-C substitution at codon 543, changing
an encoded aspartate (GAC) to alanine (GCC); the PFK-M gene on the other allele was not expressed, but
sequencing of the reported regulatory region of the gene did not reveal any mutation.

Introduction

Phosphofructokinase (PFK) (ATP; D-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase; E.C.2.7.1.11) catalyzes the
ATP-dependent phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-biphosphate in the glycolytic
pathway (Uyeda 1979). Three subunits-PFK-M (muscle), PFK-L (liver), and PFK-P (platelet)-compose tetrameric isozymes (Vora 1982). Mature human muscle
contains only the homotetramer of PFK-M, and erythrocytes contain various tetrameric combinations of
PFK-M and PFK-L.
Hereditary PFK-M deficiency (glycogenosis type VII,
or Tarui disease) is characterized by myopathic features
-exercise intolerance, cramps, and myoglobinuriatogether with signs of compensated hemolytic anemia

and hyperuricemia (Tarui et al. 1965; Kono et al. 1986;
Rowland et al. 1986). The gene encoding PFK-M has
been assigned to chromosome 1 (Vora et al. 1982); both
the sequence of the full-length cDNA and the structure
of the genomic DNA have been reported (Nakajima et
al. 1987; Yamasaki et al. 1991). Alternative splicing generates three types of PFK-M mRNA (A, B, and C),
which have the same coding region but different 5'
UTR sequences. However, type B, containing exon 2
and "intron 2," is the form predominantly expressed in
muscle (Nakajima et al. 1990a, 1990c). Exon 9 can also
be partially skipped by alternative splicing in various
normal cell lines or tissues (Nakajima et al. 1990a;
Sharma et al. 1990).
A splice-junction mutation has been described in the
original Japanese family with PFK-M deficiency (Nakajima et al. 1990b), and a second splice-junction mutation (Raben et al. 1993a), a single-nucleotide deletion,
and a missense mutation (Raben et al. 1993b) have been
reported in Ashkenazi Jewish families. The molecular
genetic basis of PFK-M deficiency in other ethnic populations has not been explored. We report three novel
mutations in four non-Ashkenazi Italian patients with
PFK-M deficiency.

Subjects and Methods
Patients and Controls
Patient /.-A 17-year-old man complained, since
childhood, of myalgia and cramps after intense exercise. He had had no episode of myoglobinuria. His peripheral red-blood-cell count and hemoglobin were
normal, but he had reticulocytosis (6.1%). Serum creatine kinase was 2,355 IU/liter (normal 30-230 IU/
liter); LDH was 575 IU/liter (normal 230-460 IU/
liter); and uric acid was 8.1 mg/dl (normal 3.5-7
mg/dl). Muscle biopsy showed myopathic changes
with subsarcolemmal glycogen accumulation. Residual
PFK activity in muscle was 1.8% of normal, and glycogen was 2.1% (normal <1%). His brother was also affected. There was no parental consanguinity, but the
family lived in a small village in southern Italy.
Patient 2.-A 35-year-old man complained, since adolescence, of exercise intolerance, exercise-related
myalgia, and cramps and had experienced a few episodes of myoglobinuria after intense exercise. He was
first seen by an internist, for mild jaundice. Serum bilirubin was 1.8 mg/dl (normal <1.0 mg/dl); creatine kinase
was 7,800 IU/liter (normal <190 IU/liter); lactate dehydrogenase was 900 IU/liter (normal 80-200 IU/liter);
glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase was 200 IU/liter
(normal 8-50 IU/liter); and glutamic pyruvic transaminase was 45 IU/liter (normal 8-50 IU/liter). Serum uric
acid level, peripheral red-blood-cell count, and hemoglobin concentration were normal, but he had reticulocytosis (4.1%). A forearm ischemic-exercise test caused
no increase of venous lactate. Muscle biopsy showed
subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar glycogen accumulations, and residual PFK activity was 3.3% of normal. The parents were first cousins.
Patient 3.-A 43-year-old man had noticed, since
childhood, that he could not keep up with his peers in
physical activities. At age 33 years, he developed proximal weakness, myalgia, and exercise intolerance. He
also had had an episode of hematuria with urate stones.
He was jaundiced, and serum bilirubin was 14.70
gmol/liter (normal <6.84 Mmol/liter). Because he had
no sign of hemolysis, Gilbert syndrome was diagnosed.
Serum creatine kinase was 1,208 IU/liter (normal <190
IU/liter); aldolase was 32 IU/liter (normal <7.6 IU/
liter); and uric acid was normal. Forearm ischemic exercise resulted in a flat lactate response. Muscle biopsy
showed fiber size variability and vacuoles, mainly in
type 2 fibers; some vacuoles were optically empty,
while others were filled with glycogen. Residual PFK
activity in muscle was 6% of normal.

Control muscle consisted of biopsies obtained for
diagnostic purposes from individuals ultimately

deemed to be free of neuromuscular diseases. Control
were extracted, as described below,
from muscle or white blood cells of 47 normal individuals and 9 patients with various metabolic myopathies:
2 with myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fibers
(MERRF); 2 with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy,
lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS); 2
with myophosphorylase deficiency; 1 with phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency; and 2 with muscle phospho-

glycerate mutase deficiency.
RNA Extraction, PCR Amplification, and Sequencing
Total RNA was extracted by a modified cesium chlo-

ride centrifugation method (Glisin et al. 1974), from
muscle tissues of patients and of a normal control. Five
DNA fragments, encompassing the entire coding region
of the PFK-M cDNA, were directly amplified from total RNA by using primers 1-10 (fig. 1 and table 1) and
the Gene Amp Thermostable rTth Reverse Transcriptase RNA PCR kit (Perkin Elmer Cetus), by following
the manufacturer's specifications. Primer 1 was designed in "intron 2" to amplify a PCR fragment from a
commonly expressed type (type B) of PFK-M mRNA,
because "intron 2" is not spliced out in type B mRNA
(Nakajima et al. 1990c). The PCR products were electrophoresed through 2% NuSieve agarose gels (FMC
Bioproducts), purified by a GeneClean kit (BIO101),
and sequenced using the same primers and the dsDNA
Cycle Sequencing System kit (GIBCO BRL Life Technologies), by following the manufacturer's specifica-

tions. DNA fragments were subjected to a cycle-sequencing PCR program in the presence of 2 pmol of
[,y-32P]ATP 5' end-labeled primer. The PCR products
were electrophoresed through a 6% polyacrylamide/7
M urea gel. The gel was vacuum-dried for 30 min and
exposed to Kodak XAR film for 12 h. PCR fragments
were again amplified, using primers 11 and 2 from the
PCR fragments of patient 1 and of a control, by using
primers 1 and 2; were electrophoresed through a 15%
polyacrylamide gel; were purified as described elsewhere (Maxam and Gilbert 1977); and were sequenced.
Taq polymerase and reagents were purchased from
Boehringer-Mannheim. PCR conditions were as follows: 30 cycles of denaturation, 94° C for 1 min; annealing, 65° C for 1 min; and extension, 72° C for 2 min.
Sequences were compared both with those of PCR
fragments obtained from a normal control and with the
previously reported cDNA sequence (Nakajima et al.
1987).
Genomic DNA Extraction, PCR Amplification,
Sequencing, and Restriction-Endonuclease Cleavage
Test
Genomic DNAs were extracted from white blood

cells of patients, their family members, and normal
controls as described elsewhere (Shanske et al. 1987).

PCR fragments, including the entire intron 6, which
contains mutation 1 (table 2), were amplified from genomic DNAs of patient 1 and of a normal control by
using primers 11 and 2 (fig. 1 and table 1). PCR conditions were as described above. The PCR fragments
were directly sequenced, as described above, using the
same primers. To simplify the detection of mutation 1,
the PCR fragments were digested by the restriction endonuclease HpaII, which cleaves the fragment in the
presence of mutation 1 (fig. 2). HpaII was purchased
from Boehringer-Mannheim. Restriction digests were
analyzed on a 2% NuSieve agarose gel.
PCR fragments containing mutations 2 (table 2) were
amplified from genomic DNAs of patient 2 and of a
normal control by using primers 12 and 13 (fig. 1 and
table 1). PCR conditions were as follows: two cycles of
denaturation, 94° C for 1 min; annealing, 60° C for 1
min; and extension, 72° C for 1 min; this was followed
by 38 cycles of denaturation, 91° C for 1 min; annealing, 65° C for 1 min; and extension, 72° C for 1 min. To
simplify the detection of mutation 2, the PCR fragment
was digested by the restriction endonuclease NlaIV,
which cleaves the fragment at the mutant site (fig. 3).
NlaIV was purchased from New England Biolabs. Restriction digests were analyzed on a 15% polyacrylamide gel.

fragment identified a homozygous A-to-C substitution
at the penultimate nucleotide of intron 6 (fig. SA), while
the rest of the sequence was normal (fig. SB).
To confirm mutation 1 and to develop a simple
screening procedure, we digested the PCR fragment
from genomic DNA by HpaII. In the presence of mutation 1, the PCR fragment (391 bp) was cleaved by HpaI
into two fragments, one of 318 bp and one of 73 bp (fig.
2). This method confirmed that patient 1 was homozygous for mutation 1 and showed that his affected
brother was also homozygous and that both parents
were heterozygous (fig. 2). Screening of 47 normal and
9 disease controls showed that none of them had mutation 1.
A Missense Mutation at Codon 39 (Mutation 2)
In patient 2, we identified a G-to-C substitution,
changing an encoded arginine (CGA) to proline (CCA)
at codon 39 in exon 4 (fig. 3A). The rest of the sequence
of the coding region, as well as the regulatory region,
was identical to that of a control.

quence analysis was ambiguous and suggested the presence of more than one fragment. Therefore, we amplified a shorter PCR fragment by using primers 11 and 2,
and the PCR product amplified with primers 1 and 2 as
a template. Electrophoresis of this fragment through a
15% polyacrylamide gel showed a faint normal band
and two shorter bands (fig. 4A). Each band was purified
and sequenced. Of the two truncated fragments, one
harbored a 5-bp deletion and the other a 12-bp deletion, and the breakpoints of both deletions corresponded to the junction between exons 6 and 7 (fig.
4B). All other fragments showed no difference in sequence from that of a normal control.
Next, we amplified, from genomic DNA of patient 1,
a PCR fragment containing the entire intron 6, using
primers 11 and 2. Analysis on a 2% NuSieve agarose gel
showed that the size of this fragment was normal, a
result implying that there was no deletion in genomic
DNA. However, thorough sequence analysis of this

mutation. As the nucleotide change
NlaIV site, the PCR fragment (95 bp)
containing mutation 2 is cleaved into three segments
(43, 22, and 30 bp) by NlaIV, while the normal fragment is cleaved into two segments (65 and 30 bp) (fig.
3B and C). This method showed that patient 2 was
homozygous for mutation 2; screening of 47 normal
and 9 disease controls showed that none of them had
this mutation.

A Missense Mutation at Codon 543 (Mutation 3)
we identified an A-to-C substitution,
changing an encoded aspartate (GAC) to alanine (GCC)
at codon 543 in exon 18 (fig. 6). The rest of the sequence was identical to that of a control.
A PCR fragment amplified from genomic DNA by
using primers 14 and 15 (fig. 1 and table 1) was used to
detect this mutation (mutation 3). However, sequencing of this fragment from genomic DNA showed that
the patient was heterozygous for mutation 3, while sequencing from RNA showed only one band corresponding to the mutant C (fig. 6). This phenomenon
was confirmed using restriction endonuclease BsoFI,
which cleaves at the site of mutation 3 (data not
shown). Restriction-enzyme analysis also showed that
the patient's mother, brother, and daughter were heterozygous for mutation 3, while his son and nephew
were negative. Screening of 47 normal and 9 disease
controls failed to show mutation 3.
In an effort to understand why the PFK-M gene on
the second allele was not expressed, we amplified a
PCR fragment containing a downstream portion of intron 1, which is believed to be the regulatory region for
the expression of type B mRNA (Yamasaki et al. 1991),

In patient 3,

using primers 16 and 17 (fig. 1 and table 1). Sequencing

We have identified three novel mutations in four patients with PFK-M deficiency from three non-Ashkenazi Italian families. Patient 1 was homozygous for an
A-to-C substitution at the penultimate nucleotide of
intron 6 (mutation 1). Every intron has a consensus
sequence AG at the 3' end, a sequence that is thought to
be essential for RNA splicing (Breathnach and Chambon 1981; Mount 1982). The AG was changed to CG
by mutation 1, and, as a result, two cryptic splice sites
in exon 7, TAAG/ATCA and ACAG/ATGA, were activated instead, generating two mRNAs, one with a 5bp deletion and the other with a 12-bp deletion (fig. 4).
Of the two mRNA species, the species with the 12-bp
deletion was more prevalent (fig. 4A). In addition to
these two abnormal mRNAs, analysis of the PCR product on a polyacrylamide gel showed a small amount of
normal mRNA (fig. 4A). Many mutations in the consensus sequence AG at the 3' end of introns have been
reported in human diseases, causing exon skipping or
activation of cryptic splice sites (Krawczak et al. 1992).
The finding, in patient 1, of some normally spliced fragment is surprising because the AG is 100% conserved
(Breathnach and Chambon 1981; Mount 1982) and was
destroyed by the mutation. This finding may be explained by the high sensitivity of "nested" PCR. While
the 5-bp deletion leads to a frameshift with premature
termination of transcription, the more common 12-bp
deletion leads only to an in-frame deletion of four
amino acids in the peptide, and there is no evidence that
these residues are located in active sites (Poorman et al.
1984). Still, we believe that mutation 1 is responsible
for PFK-M deficiency, because (1) we failed to detect
any other nucleotide difference in the coding region of
the PFK-M cDNA of patient 1; (2) an affected brother
of patient 1 was also homozygous for the same mutation, and both parents were heterozygous; and (3) 47
normal and 9 disease controls did not have the mutation.
Patient 2 was homozygous for a G-to-C substitution
(mutation 2), changing an encoded arginine (CGA) to
proline (CCA) at codon 39 in exon 4. This arginine
residue was considered to be an ATP-binding site in a

818

crystallographic study of PFK from Bacillus stearothermophilus (Evans et al. 1981; Poorman et al. 1984). It is
interesting that one of the mutations previously reported in Ashkenazi Jewish patients (Raben et al.
1993b) was a G-to-T substitution at the same nucleotide, but rather than changing the encoded arginine to
proline, the mutation changed it to leucine (CTA). This
coincidence may suggest that the arginine residue is important for enzyme activity.
Patient 3 was heterozygous for an A-to-C substitution (mutation 3), changing an encoded aspartate
(GAC) to alanine (GCC) at codon 543 in exon 18. The
aspartate residue does not appear to be located at an
active site (Poorman et al. 1984).
The two residues changed by mutations 2 and 3 are,
however, conserved in two subunits and in several species, including B. stearothermophilus PFK (Poorman et
al. 1984); rabbit PFK-M (Lee et al. 1987); and human
(Levanon et al. 1989), rat (Gehnrich et al. 1988), and
mouse PFK-L (Hotta et al. 1991). Since only the 3'-half
sequence of the human PFK-P cDNA has been reported
(Simpson and Fothergill-Gilmore 1991), the presence of
an arginine residue at codon 39 is hypothetical, but the
aspartate residue at codon 543 is also conserved in this
subunit. Moreover, the following reasons suggest that
mutations 2 and 3 are pathogenic: (1) there was no
other nucleotide difference in the sequence of the entire coding region of the PFK-M cDNA and in the
regulatory region from either patient; and (2) 47 normal
and 9 disease controls had neither mutation 2 nor mutation 3.
Because the PFK-M gene on the other allele of patient 3 was not expressed (fig. 6), we looked for a mutation in the regulatory region of the PFK-M gene of this
patient. A downstream sequence of intron 1 has been
shown to act as a positive regulator for type B mRNA
(Yamasaki et al. 1991). We amplified and sequenced
this region but found no difference from a control.
There may be a mutation in another still-unknown positive regulatory element farther upstream from the region that we studied. It is also possible that a nonsense
mutation, not detected by our method, may reduce
mRNA level from the other allele, as reported in several
human diseases (Mashima et al. 1992; Belgrader et al.
1993).
While PFK-M deficiency is a rare inherited disorder,
several pathogenic mutations have been reported (table
2), especially in Ashkenazi Jews (Raben et al. 1993a,
1993b), who represent most of the U.S. patients. No
mutations have been described in other populations,
except for a splice-junction mutation in a Japanese fam-

Tsujino

et

al.

ily (Nakajima et al. 1990b). In three non-Ashkenazi Italian families, we found three different mutations, suggesting a high degree of genetic heterogeneity, similar
to what has been reported in myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease) (Tsujino et al. 1993, 1994).
Although the number of non-Ashkenazi patients studied is relatively small, none of them had the common
splice-junction mutation found in Ashkenazi Jewish patients (Raben et al. 1993a, 1993b), a lack that may explain why PFK-M deficiency appears to be less common in non-Ashkenazi populations. Examples of
clinical heterogeneity have been reported in PFK-M deficiency, including a fatal infantile form and a late-onset
form (Servidei et al. 1986; Vora et al. 1987), but the
relation between molecular genetic lesions and clinical
phenotypes is not yet established. Molecular genetic
studies in patients with clinical variants may provide
further evidence of genetic heterogeneity.
