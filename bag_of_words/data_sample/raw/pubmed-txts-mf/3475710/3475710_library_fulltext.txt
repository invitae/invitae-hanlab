Adenosine deaminase (ADA; adenosine amiABSTRACT
nohydrolase, EC 3.5.4.4) deficiency is one cause of the genetic
disease severe combined immunodeficiency. To identify mutations responsible for ADA deficiency, we synthesized cDNAs to
ADA mRNAs from two cell lines, GM2756 and GM2825A,
derived from ADA-deficient immunodeficient patients. Sequence analysis of GM2756 cDNA clones revealed a different
point mutation in each allele that causes amino acid changes of
alanine to valine and arginine to histidine. One allele of
GM2825A also has a point mutation that causes an alanine to
valine substitution. The other allele of GM2825A was found to
produce an mRNA in which exon 4 had been spliced out but had
no other detrimental mutations. S1 nuclease mapping of
GM2825A mRNAs showed equal abundance of the full-length
ADA mRNA and the ADA mRNA that was missing exon 4.
Several of the ADA cDNA clones extended 5' of the major
initiation start site, indicating multiple start sites for ADA
transcription. The point mutations in GM2756 and GM2825A
and the absence of exon 4 in GM2825A appear to be directly
responsible for the ADA deficiency. Comparison of a number
of normal and mutant ADA cDNA sequences showed a number
of changes in the third base of codons. These changes do not
affect the amino acid sequence. Analyses of ADA cDNAs from
different cell lines detected aberrant RNA species that either
included intron 7 or excluded exon 7. Their presence is a result
of aberrant splicing of pre-mRNAs and is not related to
mutations that cause ADA deficiency.

we believe account for ADA protein instability in GM2756
and GM2825A. We also report evidence for aberrancies of
RNA splicing in both normal and ADA-deficient cells.

METHODS
Poly(A)+ RNA Isolation. All cell lines were obtained from
the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ).
Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from whole cell extracts by
guanidium thiocyanate extraction, cesium chloride gradient
centrifugation, and oligo(dT) chromatography (10).
SI Nuclease Mapping. A 1330-base-pair (bp) BamHI/Nco I
restriction fragment derived from pADA211 cDNA (6) (Fig.
1, probe II) was 3'-end-labeled with [a-32P]dCTP (11). An
excess of probe was hybridized to 2 jig of poly(A)+ RNA or
with 2 ptg of calf liver tRNA. The hybridization products were
digested with SI nuclease (Pharmacia) at 1100 units/ml at
room temperature for 1 hr (12). The digestion products were
separated on a 15-cm-long 4.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8.3 M urea.
Preparation and Analysis of B-Lymphoblast cDNA Libraries. cDNA was synthesized by the method of Gubler and
Hoffman (13). The size-selected cDNA was tailed with
terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and dCTP, annealed
with G-tailed Pst I-cut pBR322, and transformed into competent Escherichia coli RR1. Tetracycline-resistant colonies
were transferred to nitrocellulose master filters, which were
used to prepare two replicas on Zetabind membranes (AMF
Cuno, Meriden, CT). Filters were processed by the procedure of Geyer and Johnson (14), screened by hybridization
with cDNA probes derived from pADA211 (6) by Nco I
digestion (Fig. 1, probe I) or Pst I digestion (Fig. 1, probe III),
and labeled by the random primer method (15). Pst I
fragments of the ADA cDNAs were subcloned into M13mpl8
and sequenced by a modified dideoxy-chain termination
method (16). To resolve compressions, sequencing reactions
were carried out with 7-deaza-dGTP (Boehringer Mannheim)

Adenosine deaminase (ADA; adenosine aminohydrolase, EC
3.5.4.4) is part of the purine salvage pathway catalyzing the
deamination of adenosine and deoxyadenosine. While present in all mammalian tissues, ADA levels are regulated during
both differentiation and development, particularly in
lymphoid cells (1, 2). In humans, the genetic deficiency of
ADA causes severe combined immunodeficiency, which is
characterized by the failure of both B and T lymphocytes to
function properly (3, 4). B-lymphoblast cell lines have been
established from a number of ADA-deficient immunodeficient patients. Investigations of these cell lines have indicated
that most of the genetic defects underlying ADA deficiency
cause structural changes in the ADA protein (5, 6). Point
mutations altering the ADA amino acid sequence have been
reported for the ADA-deficient cell lines GM2471 (7) and
GM1715 (8).
Relative levels of ADA mRNA in the ADA-deficient cell
lines GM2825A and GM2756 are normal (9). GM2825A cells
contain mRNAs of abnormal size (6). Both lines contain <5%
of normal ADA activity and immunoreactive protein (5). We
describe here sequence analysis of ADA cDNA from these
ADA-deficient cell lines. We have identified mutations that

(17).

Blot Hybridization Analysis of Genomic DNA. High molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated (18) and 10 ,g was cut
with various restriction enzymes. Fragments were electrophoresed through a 1.0% agarose gel. The gel was processed
by modification (19) of the Southern transfer procedure (20)
using GeneScreenPlus (New England Nuclear). Probes were
32P-labeled by the random primer method (15).

RESULTS
Si Nuclease Mapping. Normally spliced mature ADA
mRNA would fully protect probe II (Fig. 1) from S1 nuclease
digestion, giving a major band of 1330 bases. Such a band is

seen at the top of the autoradiogram in Fig. 2. The faint band
in lane A (calf liver tRNA) is the result of self-hybridization
of the probe. The presence of one major band in lanes B
(ADA-deficient cell line GM2756) and C (normal cell line
GM130) indicates that the vast majority of the ADA poly(A)+
RNAs present in these cells is full-length mRNA. In lane D
(ADA-deficient cell line GM2825A), there are two major
bands of approximately equal intensity. The intensity of the
1330-base band in lane D is approximately half that in lanes
B and C. The 161-base fragment corresponds to the size
anticipated from protection of the probe by ADA RNAs with
exon 4 absent. This indicates that normal ADA mRNAs and
ADA mRNAs missing exon 4 are present in approximately
equal abundance in the cell line GM2825A, as previously
suspected (6).

RNAs. Lane A, tRNA; lanes B, C, and D, poly(A)+ RNA from cell
lines GM2756, GM130, and GM2825A, respectively; lane M, molecular weight markers (sizes in bases).

The bands of 540 and 621 bases in lanes B, C, and D
correspond to the sizes anticipated from protection of the
probe by ADA RNAs with intron 6 present or exon 7 absent
(540 bases) and intron 7 present or exon 8 absent (621 bases).
The faintness of the bands relative to the intensity of the
bands corresponding to full-length protection of the probe
indicates that they are minor species. In other S1 nuclease
protection mapping experiments (data not shown) using a
probe that was 5'-end-labeled at the junction of exons 8 and
9, minor species were seen that signaled the presence of
aberrant mRNAs with either exon 7 absent or intron 7
present. There was no evidence of mRNAs containing intron
6. The 540- and 621-base S1 nuclease-protected products
were also seen in mapping experiments with total cellular
RNAs isolated from two T-lymphoid lines, MOLT-4 and
CCRF-CEM (data not shown). That these ADA mRNA
species are found when T-cell RNA is mapped indicates that
the splicing aberrations seen in the B-cell RNAs are not
specific to B cells and therefore do not represent a posttranscriptional processing pathway specific to B cells.
Sequence Analysis of ADA cDNAs from Deficient Cell Lines
GM2756 and GM2825A. We have cloned and sequenced
cDNAs corresponding to poly(A)+ RNAs encoded by both
ADA alleles for the cell line GM2756 (Fig. 3). Each allele has
a single point mutation affecting the amino acid sequence and
several point mutations not affecting the amino acid sequence. Clone 2756-13b extends from one base short of the
major transcription initiation site into the poly(A) tail. Compared to the consensus ADA cDNA sequence, clone 275613b has a base change at position 1081 (GCG to GTG), which
results in an amino acid change of alanine to valine at amino
acid 329. Clone 2756-15 is a full-length cDNA for the other
ADA allele. In this allele, a point mutation at base 727 (CGT
to CAT) results in an arginine to histidine change at amino
acid 211. In addition to these point mutations, each allele has
a point mutation in the third base of a codon that does not
alter the amino acid encoded (Fig. 3; Table 1, columns a and
b). In clone 2756-13b, the codon for Ser-110 is TCT rather
than TCC, as found in the consensus sequence. In clone
2756-15, the codon for Val-629 is GTA rather than GTG.
Additional clones of each of the alleles were also analyzed.
These partial clones have unusual characteristics, which
suggest occasional aberrant splicing of ADA pre-mRNA.
Clone 2756-la includes intron 7. We have previously reported
a similar ADA cDNA sequence pADA3-3 (21). In both cases,
the intron 7 sequence is identical to intron 7 of the normal
ADA gene (24, 25). In contrast, clone 2756-2 has exon 7
missing. Sequence analysis showed that exon 7 was cleanly
spliced from the RNA used as template. As discussed below,

FIG. 3. Sequence analysis of ADA cDNA clones for the ADAdeficient cell line GM2756. The consensus ADA cDNA sequence
was derived from sequences of six cDNAs (6-8, 21-23), exons of two
genes (24, 25), and the cDNAs of GM2756 and GM2825A as reported
here. It is compared to full-length cDNA clones 2756-13b and 2756-15
and the partial cDNA clones 2756-la and 2756-2. Exons 1-12 are
shown as open boxes. Asterisks denote base changes relative to the
ADA consensus sequence.
we do not believe that the absence of exon 7 or the inclusion
of intron 7 is relevant to ADA deficiency.
We have previously shown by molecular hybridization to
an ADA-specific cDNA probe that the ADA-deficient cell

5949

line GM2825A has two codominant mature mRNA species, a
full-length 1.6-kilobase (kb) message and a shortened 1.45-kb
message (6). The S1 nuclease mapping reported above
indicates that the 1.45-kb message has a deletion of exon 4.
Sequence analysis of two separate GM2825A cDNA clones
(Fig. 4) confirms this observation. Clone 2825A-17b is a
partial cDNA with 1148 bases of the total sequence. Exon 4
is cleanly deleted from this clone. This cDNA has no other
mutations that alter the ADA amino acid sequence. A second
clone, 2825A-20, representing the same ADA allele, is missing exon 7 as well as exon 4. The deletion of exon 7
corresponds to that seen in clone 2756-2. Clone 2825A-10
represents the other ADA allele of this cell line (Fig. 4). It has
only one point mutation that alters an amino acid. This
mutation at base 1081 (GCG to GTG) changes amino acid 329
from alanine to valine. While this change is identical to the
one seen in clone 2756-13b, these clones do not represent the
same ADA allele. Each has another distinct mutation that
does not alter the amino acid sequence (Figs. 3 and 4; Table
1, columns a and c). These mutations are in the codon for
Ser-110 in clone 2756-13b and for Val-629 in clone 2825A-10.
Clones 2825A-10 and 2825A-20 are also unusual in that they
include an additional 48 bases and 31 bases, respectively, 5'
to the major transcription initiation site. These additional 5'
sequences agree with genomic sequence of this region (24, 25)
and indicate that there are multiple transcription initiation
sites within the 5' end of the human ADA gene. S1 nuclease
analysis of the 5' ends of ADA mRNA in our laboratory
(J.C.S., unpublished data) has shown that there is a major
initiation site, base 1 of the consensus sequence, and several
very minor initiation sites. Multiple initiation sites have been
reported for the murine ADA gene (26).
Genomic DNA Analysis. Deletions such as absence of exons
4 and 7 in ADA mRNAs might be due to small deletions in the
gene. Consequently, genomic DNA from GM2756, GM2825A, and the normal cell line GM2184 was analyzed by blot
hybridization. DNA was digested with Nco I or HindIII,
blotted, and hybridized with cDNA probe III (Fig. 1), Sma
I/Bgl II genomic probe (Fig. 5A) or HindIII genomic probe
(Fig. SB). A partial or complete deletion of exon 7 or the
flanking introns would affect the size or intensity of the
1123-bp Nco I fragment (Fig. SA). Nco I fragments of
identical size and intensity were detected in all three cell lines
with both the cDNA probe III and the Sma I/Bgl II genomic
probe (Fig. SC). Therefore, we conclude that there are no

FIG. 4. Sequence analysis of ADA cDNA clones for the ADAdeficient cell line GM2825A. The full-length cDNA clones 2825A-20
and 2825A-10 and the partial clone 2825A-17b are compared to the
consensus ADA sequence as described in Fig. 3. Exons and base
changes are as noted in Fig. 3. The hatched area designates the

large deletions affecting intron 6, exon 7, and intron 7 in the
ADA-deficient cell lines GM2756 and GM2825A.
The same general strategy was used to analyze the exon 4
deletion in GM2825A. GM2825A DNA was digested with
HindIII, blotted, and hybridized with a genomic 1185-bp
HindIII probe (Fig. 5B). If there were a deletion of exon 4
within one ADA allele, blot hybridization would give a
1185-bp band representing a normal-sized allele and a smaller
band representing the allele with a portion of exon 4 and/or
introns 3 and 4 missing. HindIII fragments of equal size and
intensity were detected in GM2825A and the normal cell line
GM2184, A deletion of the entire 1185-bp HindIII fragment
would not be detected by the HindIII probe. However, such
a deletion would affect the size and intensity of the 587-bp
Nco I fragment detected by probe III (Fig. 5A). The normal
size and intensity of this band in GM2825A excludes the
possibility of a large deletion involving exon 4 in the gene.

DISCUSSION
We have described the construction and analysis of cDNA
libraries from the ADA-deficient cell lines GM2756 and
GM2825A. GM2825A has a defect in one allele that leads to
an abnormal RNA species found to be missing exon 4. Blot
hybridization of GM2825A genomic DNA eliminated the
possibility of a large deletion in the gene that included exon
4. Isolation and sequence analysis of cDNAs corresponding
to this allele (clones 2825A-17b and -20) showed no mutations
within the remaining exons that would alter the amino acid
sequence. It seems likely that mutation(s) within intron 3
and/or intron 4 causes deletion of exon 4 during the splicing
process. The deletion of exon 4 does not alter the translational reading frame, but it is likely that any protein produced
would be rapidly degraded. Since the immunoprecipitable
ADA protein in GM2825A is <5% of that in normal cells (5)
despite normal levels of translatable mRNAs (9), we assume

that ADA encoded by the full-length mRNA species represented by clone 2825A-10 is also unstable. It is likely that the
defect in this allele, a point mutation altering alanine-329 to
valine, affects ADA protein stability.
We identified a point mutation in each allele of the
ADA-deficient cell line GM2756. In one allele, amino acid 329
is changed from alanine to valine. In the second allele, amino
acid 211 is changed from arginine to histidine. Hydropathicity
analysis by the method of Hopp and Wood (27) indicates that
the region from amino acid 208 to 213 becomes decidedly
more hydrophilic when amino acid 211 is changed from
arginine to histidine. The alanine to valine substitution has
virtually no effect on the predicted hydropathicity profile or
on the predicted secondary structure of the protein as
determined by the method of Garnier et al. (28). Because of
the absence of ADA catalytic activity and immtinoreactive
protein but presence of ADA mRNA in GM2756, we believe
these mutations both affect ADA stability.
The sequences of cDNAs encoded by 12 ADA alleles are
now known (Table 1, updated from ref. 8). Point mutations

that result in amino acid changes that are detrimental to ADA
function have previously been reported for two ADAdeficient cell lines. Bonthron et al. (8) found a nonconservative amino acid change (arginine to glutamic acid), which they
postulate causes loss of function in ADA expressed by one
allele in the ADA-deficient cell line GM1715. Two similar
mutations in ADA resulting in the substitution of arginine for
leucine and arginine for lysine were found for the deficient
cell line GM2471 (7). Use of an expression system (7) showed
that a leucine to arginine change caused loss of ADA activity.
Also of interest are the conservative base changes in ADA
mRNAs that do not alter the amino acid sequence. Among
the ADA alleles (Table 1) are five changes in the third base of
codons that do not alter the amino acids encoded. ADA may
be the first large human single copy gene for which so many
alleles have been sequenced. Therefore, it is not clear
whether this rate of conservative mutation within exons is
unique to ADA or common to other similar human genes.
The S1 nuclease mapping studies reported here indicated
the presence of minor ADA mRNA species missing exon 7 or
containing intron 7 in normal and ADA-deficient cell lines.
The relative intensities of bands that represent these two
species are darker than the very faint bands corresponding to
other incompletely processed species. Both species are
relatively abundant and stable as indicated by their availability as templates for cDNA synthesis. The sequence at the
exon 7/intron 7 splice site (GAG:GTGAGG) in clone 2756-la
is identical to the sequence found in the normal ADA genomic
DNA (24). We have compared this sequence to the consensus
5' splice site sequence of Sharp (29), which is (A/C)AG:
GT(A/G)AGT. The three bases within the exon preceding the
splice site and the 4 bases following the GT (invariant bases
+1 and +2) are only moderately conserved (30). The exon
7/intron 7 splice site of ADA has alternate bases at positions
-3 and +6. Aebi et al. (31) have shown that changing the base
at position -3 from adenine or cytosine to guanine and the
base at +6 from thymine to adenine or guanine of the 5' splice
site of intron 2 impairs correct splicing and promotes joining
of exon 1 to exon 3 in the large rabbit f3-globin RNA. Similar
inefficient use of the 5' splice site of intron 7 in ADA where
base -3 is guanine and base +6 is guanine may account for
the two aberrant exon 7 intron 7 mRNA species. In one case,
the inefficient utilization of the intron 7 splice site leads to
mRNA species without exon 7. In the second case, the
splicing process fails to remove intron 7. The efficiency of
splicing may also be influenced by RNA secondary structures
(32) and the size of intron 7. Intron 7 in ADA contains only
76 bases and is near the minimum intron size of 60 bases
required for accurate splicing (30).
