Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD;
ABSTRACT
EC 1.1.1.49) deficiency is a common genetic abnormality
affecting an estimated 400 million people worldwide. Clinical
and biochemical analyses have identified many variants exhibiting a range of phenotypes, which have been well characterized
from the hematological point of view. However, until now, their
precise molecular basis has remained unknown. We have
cloned and sequenced seven mutant G6PD alleles. In the
nondeficient polymorphic African variant G6PD A we have
found a single point mutation. The other six mutants investigated were all associated with enzyme deficiency. In one of the
commonest, G6PD Mediterranean, which is associated with
favism among other clinical manifestations, a single amino acid
replacement was found (serine -- phenylalanine): it must be
responsible for the decreased stability and the reduced catalytic
efficiency of this enzyme. Single point mutations were also
found in G6PD Metaponto (Southern Italy) and in G6PD Ilesha
(Nigeria), which are asymptomatic, and in G6PD Chatham,
which was observed in an Indian boy with neonatal jaundice.
In G6PD "Matera," which is now known to be the same as
G6PD A-, two separate point mutations were found, one of
which is the same as in G6PD A. In G6PD Santiago, a de novo
mutation (glycine -* arginine) is associated with severe chronic
hemolytic anemia. The mutations observed show a striking
predominance of C -* T transitions, with CG doublets involved
in four of seven cases. Thus, diverse point mutations may
account largely for the phenotypic heterogeneity of G6PD
deficiency.

therefore purification of sufficient quantities for protein
sequence analysis has been very difficult, or impossible in
cases of severe deficiency. This has prevented the identification of the specific amino acid changes responsible for
altered phenotypes. Recently, the gene that encodes human
G6PD, which is located on chromosome Xq28, has been
cloned and the coding sequence was determined (7-9),
enabling us to study the molecular basis of G6PD deficiency.
In this paper we describe the cloning and sequencing of seven
mutant G6PD alleles, six of them from deficient subjects. We
show that the wide range of clinical phenotypes associated
with G6PD deficiency has arisen from different point mutations in the coding sequence of the G6PD gene.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Biochemical Characterization. Of the seven G6PD variants
described here, three have been previously published. For
the other four, the following biochemical properties were
studied by using methods recommended by the World Health
Organization (WHO) (10): G6PD activity in erythrocytes,
electrophoretic mobility in Tris/borate/EDTA buffer (pH
8.9), Kr"P, 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate % rate, KNADP, and
the thermostability at 560C. KNADPH was determined as in
ref. 11, and the elution profile from DEAE-Sephadex was
determined as in ref. 12. The KGm6P for G6PD Chatham was
measured under the conditions described in ref. 13, and the
value was normalized to WHO conditions by using the ratio
of values obtained by the two methods with G6PD B.
Preparation and Screening of Genomic Libraries. DNA was
prepared from whole blood or Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes (14). Phage A genomic libraries were
constructed from this DNA after it had been digested with
HindIll or EcoRI and size-fractionated on 0.5% agarose gels
or 10-40% sucrose gradients. To obtain the entire G6PD
coding sequence, two independent phage clones were isolated (see Fig. 1). (i) Exons I and II were cloned on a
12.5-kilobase (kb) EcoRI fragment into AGTWes or AEMBL4
(15). (ii) Exons III-XIII were cloned on either an 8.5-kb
partial EcoRI fragment into AGTWes or a 17-kb HindIII
fragment into A2001 (16). AGTWes EcoRI arms were obtained
from Bethesda Research Laboratories; AEMBL4 EcoRI arms
were prepared by digesting AEMBL4 DNA with EcoRI and
BamHI and then purifying the arms by passage through
Sephacryl S-300 columns followed by isopropyl alcohol
precipitation. A2001 HindIII arms were prepared in the same
way, except that the DNA was digested with HindIII and

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; EC 1.1.1.49)
deficiency is a genetic abnormality associated with a range of
clinical conditions (1). Some subjects are asymptomatic,
whereas others suffer from neonatal jaundice, acute hemolytic anemia, or severe chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic
anemia. Over 300 G6PD variants have been described by
using clinical and biochemical criteria (2) and at least 100 of
these have polymorphic frequencies in various populations
(3). This makes G6PD deficiency probably the most common
human enzymopathy, affecting an estimated 400 million
people worldwide. There is abundant evidence that -this
widespread polymorphism results from relative resistance of
heterozygotes to Plasmodiumfalciparum malaria (4-6). The
fact that a large number of different deficient variants have
been characterized suggests that a considerable variety of
structural changes can cause abnormal enzyme activity.
G6PD is a housekeeping enzyme, present in all species so
far tested (3). It is produced only at low levels in all cells and

EcoRI. Ligated material was packaged by using Gigapack
extracts (Northumbria Biologicals, U.K.) or freeze-thaw
lysates and sonicated extracts (17). The libraries were
screened by standard Benton-Davis filter hybridization (18)
using the appropriate G6PD probes labeled by nicktranslation (Amersham).
Sequencing. DNA from plaque-purified phage was subcloned into M13 phage for Sanger dideoxy sequencing (19) or
into pUC18 for dideoxy sequencing of denatured plasmid
DNA (20). Sequencing reactions were primed by using a set
of oligonucleotides homologous to intron sequences near the
intron-exon junctions (see Fig. 1). Exons I and II were
subcloned on either a 2-kb Pst I fragment or a 6-kb HindIII/
EcoRI fragment, whereas for exons III-XIII the 3.5-kb and
5-kb EcoRP fragments were subcloned.
Southern Blotting. Analysis of Pst I and Hinfl digestions of
genomic DNA prepared from various individuals was carried
out by Southern hybridization using conventional methods
(17).

RESULTS
The G6PD variants studied are representative of a wide range
of clinical and biochemical features. G6PD A is a nondeficient variant, widely distributed in Africa (21), with polymorphic gene frequencies reaching 0.25 in several populations (22). G6PD Mediterranean is one of the best-studied
G6PD variants (23); it is polymorphic and is associated with
acute hemolytic anemia, including favism. G6PD Ilesha is a
sporadic variant from West Africa, found in a patient with
sickle cell anemia (24). G6PD Metaponto is asymptomatic;
since it was encountered in two unrelated people in Lucania
(Southern Italy), it may be polymorphic in that region. G6PD
Chatham was identified in a boy of Indian ancestry living in
England who has had neonatal jaundice; its frequency in the
Indian population as a whole has not been established. G6PD
"Matera," which is in fact probably G6PD A- (see Discussion), is associated with favism; it was encountered in
Lucania and it is polymorphic. G6PD Santiago de Cuba is a
sporadic variant (see below) found in a boy from Cuba with
chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia.
The biochemical features of the G6PD variants we have
investigated include varying degrees of deficiency with normal or abnormal electrophoretic mobility and, in some cases,
distinctive changes in thermostabiity and enzyme kinetics
(Table 1). For example, G6PD Mediterranean has a significantly increased affinity for G6P; G6PD Chatham has a
slightly decreased affinity for G6P and a significantly reduced
in vitro thermostability; G6PD Santiago de Cuba also has
reduced in vitro thermostability and a markedly decreased
affinity for NADP.

To identify changes in the G6PD protein responsible for
these altered properties, we have obtained genomic clones of
the G6PD gene from seven male individuals with variant
enzyme. Sequencing of G6PD-positive clones was achieved
by using a set of custom-designed oligonucleotides (Fig. 1);
these permit the rapid sequencing of different clones and will
allow the amplification of specific exons with the polymerase
chain reaction technique. Comparison ofthe coding sequence
of these G6PD clones with the previously published sequence
of normal G6PD B revealed unique base changes (Table 2).
In six cases, single point mutations were identified. With
the exception of G6PD A, we can infer these to be the cause
of G6PD deficiency. In the seventh case, G6PD "Matera,"
two separate point mutations are present. One of these is the
same as that found in the nondeficient variant, G6PD A, and
so we infer that the other is responsible for enzyme deficiency. Six of the

seven

mutations

are

on

either the coding or the noncoding strand, and in four of these
the C precedes a G in a CG doublet. The amino acids changed
by these mutations are spread throughout the G6PD protein
sequence, as shown in Fig. 2. In each case, the inferred amino
acid substitution is consistent with the observed change in
electrophoretic mobility of the variant enzyme by comparison with the normal.

Pst I site that is not present in the normal G6PD B gene. This
has enabled us to confirm that this mutation is present in the
genomic DNA of the individual from which the library was
prepared. Southern blot analysis of his DNA, using a probe
for the 3' end of the G6PD gene, revealed a 1.8-kb Pst I
fragment that has not been seen in >100 similarly analyzed
DNA samples, including one from the mother of the propositus (Fig. 3). By using a minisatellite probe (30), there is no
suggestion that she is not the real mother (data not shown).
Therefore we conclude that G6PD Santiago de Cuba must
have arisen through a new mutation that took place either in
the propositus early in embryogenesis or in his mother's germ
cell line.
In G6PD Ilesha the G

variant confirms the mutation (Fig. 4). In this case, the
mother's DNA was not available, but we know from pedigree
analysis (31) that this mutation, although sporadic, is not new
in the propositus.

DISCUSSION
Identification of mutations that cause pathology is of interest
not only in the understanding of genetic disease but also for

sponding normal function of the respective gene product. The
biochemistry of G6PD and the clinical manifestations of its
deficiency have been studied extensively (2, 3), yet little is
known about the protein at the molecular level. Recently, the
primary sequence for the protein was determined through the
isolation of full-length cDNA clones (7). Here we identify
different point mutations in this coding sequence that are the
cause of enzyme deficiency in different individuals. They provide direct proof of the genetic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency, previously inferred from biochemical data. We demonstrate that different point mutations give rise to different clinical
phenotypes. In addition these data provide an insight into which
amino acids are important for G6PD enzyme stability and
function.
Of course, assignment of specific function to different
amino acids within the protein awaits elucidation of its
three-dimensional structure, and this set of variants is too
small for us to attempt an analysis of how amino acid replacements cause a reduction of G6PD activity by impairing catalytic
function, making the protein unstable, or both. However, with
respect to catalytic function, the variant with the most abnormal

erythrocytes, presumably as a result of accelerated G6PD

ment in G6PD Santiago de Cuba is located within a sequence of

hydrophobic amino acids (32), which might make this replacement particularly damaging. Also, within our series of variants
this is the only example that is associated with a severe clinical
condition and it is a de novo mutation.
With respect to G6PD A, our data confirm the asparagine
aspartic acid amino acid replacement reported by Yoshida
20 years ago (33) and recently placed at position 142 (34).
Although we give a position number of 126, we presume that
these two different numbers represent the same amino acid
due to a difference in the N-terminal portion (52 vs. 36 amino
acids) of the two published protein sequences (7, 9). The
N-terminal sequence shown here (Fig. 2) is that derived from

from 1.35 kb in normals to 1.6 kb in this variant due to a point

" Matera" is in fact A-, as we have learned recently that the
amino acid replacements reported here for G6PD "Matera"
are the same as those found in G6PD A - (35). The extent to
which biochemically similar variants turn out to be genetically identical will become clear as more are defined at the
molecular level. The finding of two mutational differences
between G6PD B and G6PD A - did not come as a complete
surprise, since this had been hypothesized some time ago on
the grounds of biochemical and genetic considerations (13).
We note the striking predominance of C -+ T transitions in
our series of mutations. Although, of course, the sample size
is small, this finding is entirely consistent with previous
observations on interspecies (36) and intraspecies (37) variation in globins and other genes. In four cases the mutated C
residue is in a CpG doublet. Methylation and subsequent
deamination of this C are thought to increase the probability
of a C -- T transition (38, 39), and there is growing evidence
that this is indeed the case in other human genes as well (40).
The pattern of mutations causing human pathology has
been extensively explored in a number of genes with cellspecific expression. For instance, with respect to globins,
factor VIII, and steroid sulfatase there have been reports of
point mutations and sizeable deletions (41-43). The latter are
possible because complete loss of function of such genes is
compatible with development in embryonic life and beyond.
The findings reported here begin to define the pattern of
mutations in a highly polymorphic housekeeping gene, in
which complete loss of function would probably be lethal.
