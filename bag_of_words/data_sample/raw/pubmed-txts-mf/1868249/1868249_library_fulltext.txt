The Spectrum of Genetic Defects in a Panel of 40 Dutch Families With
Symptomatic Protein C Deficiency Type I: Heterogeneity and Founder Effects
By P.H. Reitsma, S.R. Poort, C.F. Allaart, E. Briet, and R.M. Bertina
Heterozygosity for protein C deficiency is associated with
thromboembolic episodes, but clinical symptoms are nonrandomly distributed among protein C deficient families. This
finding has led to the provisional definition of clinically
dominant and clinically recessive protein C deficiency. We
report here the molecular basis of hereditary, clinically
dominant protein C deficiency in a panel of 40 Dutch probands
from apparently independent families. All but one subject
was a heterozygote for a point mutation in the protein C
gene. These 39 subjects shared 15 mutations, six of which
occurred in more than one proband (between two and nine).

The diversity in the 15 mutations, together with the observation that the most frequent Dutch mutation was also found in
a Swedish family with clinically recessive protein C deficiency, makes it unlikely that the molecular basis of protein C
deficiency will be different between the clinically dominant
and recessive forms. The recurrence of one of the mutations
is most likely due to a founder effect, which suggests that
when an additional hereditaryfactor is involved in the clinical
severity of protein C deficiency this factor may remain linked
to the protein C gene over many generations.

These findings contrast sharply with two sets of data that
do not support a strong association between heterozygosity
for protein C deficiency and thrombotic disease. First, there
is the observation that in many instances severely affected
homozygous infants were born from heterozygous parents
who have neither a personal predisposition to thrombosis
Second, the measurenor a family history of
ment of protein C levels in a large panel of 4,723 healthy
blood donors resulted in an estimate of the prevalence of
heterozygous protein C deficiency in the general population
of 1 in 200 to 300.” None of the hereditary protein
C-deficient subjects identified in this survey had a personal
or family history of thrombosis (clinically recessive protein
C deficiency).
These two sets of observations strongly suggest that only
in a subset of hereditary protein C deficiencies (one in 50 to
80) is the disorder associated with a predisposition to
thrombosis. At present, it is unknown which factor(s)
influence the apparently nonrandom distribution of thrombotic symptoms among protein C-deficient families. One
possibility is that the genetic abnormality is different
between clinically dominant and recessive protein C deficiency. Alternatively, some unidentified additional genetic
factor may determine the predisposition towards thrombosis.” This factor may cosegregate with protein C deficiency
in the symptomatic families, and may have segregated from
the protein C defect, at a rate dependent on the genetic
distance, in asymptomatic families.
To address these issues one needs to know the primary
genetic defect that underlies hereditary protein C deficiency in both symptomatic and asymptomatic families. As
a first step, we report here the genetic analysis of a panel of
40 probands of Dutch symptomatic families with clinically
dominant protein C deficiency type I. In all but one subject
a molecular abnormality due to a point mutation was found.
Of the 15 distinct mutations shared by these 39 probrands,
six occurred in more than one subject and accounted for
75% of the genetic defects. The recurrence of one of these
six mutations was found to be due to “identity by descent”
and not to independent mutational events. If an additional
genetic factor is involved in the predisposition towards
thrombosis, our data suggest that this factor may remain
linked to the protein C gene defect over many generations.

HE HUMAN BLOOD coagulation cascade is downregulated by a variety of natural anticoagulant mechanisms. Among these mechanisms is the so-called “protein C
anticoagulant pathway.”‘ This pathway is initiated when
thrombin (generated in the coagulation cascade) binds to
the endothelial membrane receptor thrombomodulin. The
resulting complex activates the zymogen protein C. Activated protein C in turn inactivates the procoagulant cofactors Va and VIIIa, thereby downregulating the coagulation
cascade and limiting the deposition of fibrin.
The physiologic importance of the protein C anticoagulant pathway is most dramatically illustrated by the rarely
occurring homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for
protein C deficiency, which have undetectable levels of
protein C activity and/or

GENETIC DEFECTS IN PROTEIN C DEFICIENCY

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

All subjects are symptomatic probands from Dutch families with
a hereditary protein C deficiency (clinically dominant type). These
patients were originally identified by screening patients with a
personal and family history of thrombosis. They all have a type I
deficiency, ie, a concordant reduction of protein C activity and
antigen. The laboratory diagnosis was made using criteria previously described.'* In nine cases, only the DNA of the proband was
available for analysis. In the other cases, DNA from normal and
deficient family members was available for analysis of the cosegregation of the genetic defect with the deficiency.
The strategy for identifying mutations focussed on finding
alterations in the coding sequence of the protein C gene and made
use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).I3 Primers used in the
PCR were derived from the genomic sequence (Table l),L4,'5
and
were chosen such that each amplified fragment contained the
entire coding sequence plus splice junctions of an exon. The
conditions used in the PCR were as follows: 0.7 minutes of
denaturation at 95"C, 1minute of annealing at 50"C, and 2 minutes
of extension at either 63°C (exons 1,2,3,6,7, and 8), 65°C (exons 4
and 5), or 70°C (exon 9). Further reaction conditions were as
described before.16
After the PCR, the complete reaction mixture was run at 4°C on
an ultra-low gelling temperature agarose gel and the segment of
the gel containing the amplified fragment was excised. Without
further purification, 1to 5 FL of the gel slice was heated at 95°C for
4 minutes and used as DNA template in a commercially available
DNA-sequencing kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) as described before."
For each of the mutations reported here, all nine regions were
sequenced to exclude the possibility of more than one sequence
abnormality. However, when a particular mutation was found in
more than one proband the sequencing of all nine exons was
performed only in the first.
RESULTS

Of the 40 protein C-deficient probands in this study, 39
were found to be heterozygous for a point mutation in the
protein C gene (Table 2 ) . These 39 subjects shared 15

distinct mutations that varied from splice site and nonsense
mutations, which putatively alter normal splicing and translation, to missense mutations of which the relationship to
the type I protein C deficiency is not immediately clear. In
addition, the proband from family PC44 was not only
heterozygous for a '32Gln--* Stop but also for an apparently
rare but neutral sequence abnormality in the codon for
17*Arg(CGG + CGA) that did not cosegregate with the
protein C deficiency.
Notably, this latter observation raises the possibility that
investigators are dealing in part with rare but neutral amino
acid sequence variations rather than with mutations that
are directly responsible for the protein C deficiency. To
minimize this possibility we made certain that the protein C
gene sequences that are amplified by the primer sets in
Tabe 1 did not contain a second abnormality. In addition,
when DNA from normal and deficient family members was
available, we compared the inheritance of the protein C
deficiency with that of the genetic abnormality. To simplify
this analysis, use was made of the finding that 11 of the 15
mutations are readily detectable from an altered digestion
pattern for particular restriction enzymes (Table 2). In the
remaining cases, the genetic abnormality was monitored by
a sequence analysis. For all but three mutations, DNA was
available from family members (varying from two to more
than 60) for this type of analysis, and invariably cosegregation of protein C deficiencywith the mutation was observed.
Six of the 15 mutations were found in more than one
independent proband. Two of these ('"Cys + Tyr and
40311e
+ Met) occurred two times and one (76Phe+ Leu)
occurred three times. The remaining three mutations
("'Arg + Cys, I3'Gln + Stop, and "Arg -+ Stop) were considerably more frequent and recurred nine, nine, and five
times, respectively. Taken together, these six mutations
accounted for 75% (30 of 40) of the mutations.
The recurrent mutations have either arisen indepen-

dently or are "identical by descent" (founder effect). In the
case of independent mutational events, their high frequency may be due to hotspots for mutation like the CpG
dinucleotides" that are involved in the 230Arg Cys and
'O6Arg -+ Stop mutations. To decide which of the two
mechanisms is most likely responsible for the recurrent
mutations, one may take geographic and ethnic information
into consideration and perform a haplotype analysis of the
defective allele. We have previously reported the cosegregation of the M6Arg-+ Stop mutation with a rare intragenic
Msp I restriction site polymorphism in three of the five
families with the "'Arg

Because such a linkage between a particular mutation and a
rare polymorphism argues against the independent origin
of the mutation^'^ we attempted a genealogic investigation
of the five families. As shown in Fig 1,by going back to 1757
we found a common ancestor for three of the probands.
The remaining two families could not be linked to this
pedigree because of a foundling and an unmarried mother
in the ancestry.
In addition to the abnormalities in Table 2 and the

(T) and 40% (A) (74 alleles tested). The second polymorphism is a T + G transversion in the triplet coding for 99Ser
(TCT -+ TCG, also Ser) with allelic frequencies of 59% (T)
and 41% (G) (78 alleles tested). The third polymorphism is
a C -+ T transition in the triplet coding for *I4Asp
(GAT+GAC) with allelic frequencies of 67% (T) and
33% (C) (78 x alleles tested). This latter polymorphism,
which specifies Asp in both sequences, was already predicted by Foster et all4from a difference between a cDNA
and a genomic sequence.
DISCUSSION

The main aim of this study was to establish the genetic
basis of clinically dominant protein C deficiency type I in a
representative panel of probands from symptomatic families. The results indicate that although there is a considerable heterogeneity in the genetic abnormalities, some of the
mutations predominate.
It came as a surprise that 10 of the 15 mutations that are
each associated with a type I deficiency predict amino acid
replacements. We had expected that a larger proportion of
the mutations would lead to stop codons, frameshifts, or
splice site abnormalities. Even though we observed a
neutral abnormality in the codon for ”‘Arg, it is unlikely
that all of these missense mutations also represent rare but
neutral variants of protein C because each was the only
mutation observed in the protein C genes of a particular
proband, and because invariably cosegregation of a type I
protein C deficiencywith the genetic defect was observed in
the family of the proband. It may be that some of the
aminoacid replacements result in the improper folding of
the protein C zymogen and that these aberrant molecules
are removed from the endoplasmatic reticulum or the Golgi
apparatus before secretion through a mechanism that

involves so-called “chaperone” proteins.2o”’Alternatively,
some of the abnormalities that we classify as a missense
mutation may actually be a splite site mutation. For
instance, the ’19Ser-+Arg replacement results from a C +
C
G mutation in the sequence. . . AG & TGTGC. . . The
G
newly generated sequence closely resembles the consensus
A
of a donor splice site AG GT AGT,” and if actually used
G
would lead not only to an aberrantly spliced RNA but also
to a frameshift.
Given the spectrum of mutations in clinically dominant
protein C deficiency it is difficult to imagine how these may
differ qualitatively from the mutations in clinically recessive
protein C deficiency. Many homozygotes born from heterozygous parents without a personal or family history of
thrombosis have undetectable levels of protein C. This level
of protein C would be compatible with any of the stop
codons we found in our panel. Because we have not
identified any asymptomatic families in the Dutch population we are not able to test such individuals for the presence
of any of the mutations that we report here. We can add,
however, that we have identified a 230Arg+ Cys mutation
(which occurred nine times in our panel) in a Swedish
compound heterozygote that was born from parents without a personal or family history of thrombosisz3(Reitsma et
al, unpublished). This finding clearly indicates that, indeed,
no qualitative difference in the mutations between symptomatic and asymptomatic families will be found.
The proposal that comparable genetic defects underlie
protein C deficiency in symptomatic and asymptomatic
families is at odds with the terms clinically dominant and
clinically recessive protein C deficiency. These terms suggest that the two forms of deficiency constitute distinct
genetic entities. However, until it is established which
additional factor(s) determine the susceptibility of a protein C-deficient subject to the development of thrombosis,
these terms may remain useful to distinguish the protein
C-deficient individuals as they have been claimed to abound
in the general population from those that are members of
thrombophilic families. These latter individuals, unlike
their counterparts in the population at large, carry the
protein C deficiency as a dominant marker for increased
thrombotic risk.
With respect to the hypothesis that a second abnormality
cosegregates with protein C deficiency in the symptomatic
individuals,’.” the results from the genealogic investigation
presented in Fig 1 are intriguing. One way of interpreting
these results is that they show that such a hypothetical
factor remains linked to the protein C deficiency over many
generations and, therefore, should map relatively close to
the protein C gene on chromosome 2. The implication of
such an interpretation is that the hypothetical factor is not a
coagulation protein because all of these have been localized
on other chromosomes and any abnormality in these
proteins should segregate rapidly from the protein C
deficiency. The only exception is the gene for the lipoproteinassociated coagulation inhibitor (LACI) that has recently

a94

REITSMA ET AL

been mapped on chromosome 2q31-32,24which is, however,
relatively distant from the protein C locus 2q13-14.=
In the families in which we have identified the genetic
abnormality underlying the type I protein C deficiency it
will be relatively simple to screen the family for the
presence of heterozygotes. At present, the diagnosis relies
on assays of protein C antigen and/or activity. However,
occasionally this reliance on protein C levels will lead to a
misdiagnosis because on the one hand there is an overlap
between the plasma levels of normals and heterozygotes
and on the other hand there are many patients in which one
considers a diagnosis who are taking oral anticoagulants, a
treatment that in itself will result in a decrease of the
protein C level. By adding a genetic test one can now
unequivockbly assign a subject to either the normal or the
deficiency group and estimate precisely the correlation
between the protein C deficiency and thrombosis. This

study is now underway at our institute for the families
described in this report.
