Abstract
We have analyzed the nucleotide sequence of the androgen receptor from 22 unrelated subjects with substitution mutations
of the hormone-binding domain. Eleven had the phenotype of
complete testicular feminization, four had incomplete testicular
feminization, and seven had Reifenstein syndrome. The underlying functional defect in cultured skin fibroblasts included individuals with absent, qualitative, or quantitative defects in ligand binding. 19 of the 21 substitution mutations (90%) cluster
in two regions that account for 35% of the hormone-binding
domain, namely, between amino acids 726 and 772 and between
amino acids 826 and 864. The fact that one of these regions is
homologous to a region of the human thyroid hormone receptor
(hTR-,B) which is a known cluster site for mutations that cause
thyroid hormone resistance implies that this localization of mutations is not a coincidence. These regions of the androgen receptor may be of particular importance for the formation and
function of the hormone-receptor complex. (J. Clin. Invest.

studying the functional properties in genital skin fibroblasts
cultured from patients (3, 4). The cloning of cDNAs encoding
the receptor protein (5-8) and the elucidation of the androgen
receptor gene structure (9, 10) then made it possible to characterize the underlying mutations in molecular terms.
Several categories of these mutations are now recognized.
Deletion of the coding sequence for the gene (1 1, 12) or nucleotide substitutions that cause the insertion ofpremature termination codons (10, 13-15) result in the failure to form a functional protein, and hence cause profound androgen resistance
associated with absent ligand binding in fibroblasts. In contrast, mutations that cause amino acid substitutions in the
DNA-binding domain cause receptor positive androgen resistance in which ligand binding to the receptor is normal, but the
hormone-receptor complex does not bind normally to DNA
(16, 17). Mutations also occur in the androgen-binding domain
of the receptor (18-23). In this study, we describe the localization of the mutation from 20 previously unreported subjects
and from two previously studied subjects with mutations ofthe
hormone-binding domain.
Methods

Introduction
Like other members of the steroid-thyroid hormone-retinoid
class of receptors, the androgen receptor contains three distinct
domains: a hormone-binding region, a DNA-binding region,
and an amino-terminal region (1). Mutations of the androgen
receptor in 46,XY individuals cause a spectrum of androgenresistance syndromes, ranging from women with complete testicular feminization to men with infertility or minor degrees of
undervirilization (2). In part because the gene that encodes the
androgen receptor is X-linked, and hence mutations of the androgen receptor are expressed in hemizygous males, mutations
of the human androgen receptor may be more common than
mutations of all other receptors of this class combined. The
mutant androgen receptors were initially characterized by

Clinical history and phenotype. The patients described in this study
were referred by various physicians. Phenotype was established by the
referring physicians or by the authors in selected instances (2). Two
patients in this report have been reported separately, as noted in the
legend to Table I.
Characterization of receptor binding in cultured genital skin fibroblasts. Monolayer binding assays (2) were performed, and qualitative
abnormalities of receptor binding (e.g., thermolability and dissociation
rate) were characterized. For quantification of immunoreactive androgen receptor in fibroblasts, genital skin fibroblasts were scraped in PBS,
pelleted, and homogenized in SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer
(24). The samples were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide
gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected with an antibody directed at the amino terminus of the receptor protein (24).
Androgen receptor gene analysis. Individual exons were amplified
from 22 patients with various phenotypes (10). In 16 patients, the entire coding sequence of the androgen receptor gene was determined,
with two exceptions. First, because of inaccuracies introduced during
the amplification and cloning of the glutamine repeats, these analyses
are only estimates of the size. In the case of the glycine repeats, sequencing has not been performed. In the remaining six patients, exons 2-8
were completely sequenced.

Results

cultures show limited agreement with clinical phenotype. Androgen resistance is commonly associated with qualitative or
quantitative abnormalities of receptor binding in genital skin

this manuscript denotes abnormalities in hormone binding by
the androgen receptor, in keeping with the classification
scheme that we have previously used (I). Despite the utility of
this methodology as a marker of androgen resistance, ligand
binding assays do not uniformly correlate with patient phenotype. The group of mutations of the ligand-binding domain of
the androgen receptor in this study (Table I) caused both female (complete or incomplete testicular feminization) and
male phenotypes (Reifenstein syndrome). Furthermore, in cultured skin fibroblasts, these mutations were associated with

substitutions causing receptor binding negative androgen resistance are present in the same regions of the hormone-binding

domain responsible for qualitative abnormalities of the receptor protein. In both categories, most amino acid substitutions
are localized in two specific regions of the hormone-binding
domain: betweei amino acids 726 and 772 and between amino
acids 829 and 853. This finding suggests that the distinction
between qualitative and quantitative abnormalities of ligand
binding is one of degree. That is, lesser perturbations of the
structure ofthe hormone-binding domain cause qualitative abnormalities, whereas more marked disruption of the hormonebinding domain structure prevents ligand binding completely.
However, the differences in phenotypic expression between
patients cannot be explained solely by the different amino acid
substitutions. Two unrelated individuals in this study (subjects
450 and 593) each have the same amino acid substitution
(R838H), and yet one (subject 450) had incomplete testicular
feminization and the other (subject 593) had the Reifenstein
phenotype. In like fashion, although patients 217 and 855 har-

acid 772 in the androgen receptor is a mutation that has been
identified in several different pedigrees and is situated five
amino acids from an amino acid residue that is mutated in the
thyroid receptor-, in three families with thyroid hormone resistance. In addition, androgen receptor mutations at residues
761, 762, and 746 are located in close proximity to mutations
in the thyroid receptor-, causing thyroid hormone resistance at
amino acid residues 305, 312, 317, and 327 in the thyroid re-

domains of the normal androgen receptor gene is shown. The location
of mutations in the ligand-binding domain for 10 subjects with qualitative receptor binding abnormalities and 10 subjects with receptor
binding negative (androgen resistance; Table I) are shown. Two mutations (R853H) associated with a quantitative abnormality in receptor binding (Table I) are not shown on this schematic. (B) A histogram of amino acid substitution mutations in the hormone-binding
domain of the androgen receptor described in this report (filled circles) and in other laboratories (open circles) (18, 21-23, 27). For the
purposes of this diagram and discussion, all of the mutations have
been assigned using the numbering system of Tilley et al (7). The two
solid arrows indicate the relative position ofamino acid substitutions
in the glucocorticoid receptor that are reported to cause glucocorticoid resistance (28, 29). The open arrow indicates the relative positions
of an amino acid substitution reported to cause vitamin D resistance (30).

bor the same mutation, one is classified as complete testicular
feminization and the other as having the Reifenstein phenotype. These findings imply that genetic determinants outside
the coding sequence of the androgen receptor can influence the
function and/or stability of the receptor protein.
A group ofmutations in the hormone-binding domain ofthe
androgen receptor is centered on a region affected by mutations
in the thyroid hormone receptor-beta. Amino acid substitutions
in the hormone-binding domain of the thyroid receptor-f3 that
cause generalized thyroid hormone resistance also cluster in
two regions of the thyroid receptor hormone-binding domain
(31, 32). When the predicted amino acid sequence of the ligand-binding domains of the androgen and thyroid hormone
receptors are aligned, an interesting pattern emerges (Fig. 2).
First, several mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor-3
have no correlates in the androgen receptor. Likewise, many
androgen receptor mutations are not paralleled by thyroid receptor mutations; this is particularly true for the cluster of androgen receptor mutations located between residues 829 and
864. By contrast, the segment between residues 726 and 772 of
the androgen receptor is homologous to an area of the thyroid
hormone receptor (residues 310-342) in which several amino
acid substitutions that cause thyroid hormone resistance are
localized. The androgen receptor amino acid substitution at
position 764 involves a residue that corresponds to a residue in
the hTR-,3 that is mutated in two different families with thyroid
hormone resistance. The amino acid substitution at amino

Discussion
Single amino acid substitution mutations ofthe ligand-binding
domain of the androgen receptor can cause either absent (< 4
fmol/mg protein), decreased, or qualitatively abnormal ligand
binding in genital skin fibroblasts from patients with androgen
resistance. Furthermore, these mutations can cause a spectrum
of phenotypes, from women with complete or incomplete testicular feminization to men with Reifenstein syndrome (perineoscrotal hypospadias and gynecomastia). These variable phenotypes and ligand-binding characteristics appear to reflect the
degree to which ligand binding and receptor function are
disrupted by the various substitutions.
The finding that 20 of 22 such mutations examined cluster
in two relatively discrete regions of the hormone-binding domain is intriguing. Although the amino terminal boundary of
the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor has not
been determined, studies of the glucocorticoid receptor hormone-binding domain (33) and the definition of amino acid
substitutions in the androgen receptor at residue 693 (22) that
cause abnormalities of hormone binding in two patients with
androgen resistance suggest that it extends at least to the area of
residue 690. Using amino acid residue 690 as the amino terminal boundary of the hormone-binding domain would localize
90% of the mutations in our patients to two segments that
account for 20 and 15% of the coding sequences of the androgen-binding domain. This suggests that these regions are of
particular importance for receptor function and for the stable
association of receptor with ligand.
It is possible, of course, that this clustering could be the
result ofcoincidence or some type ofselection bias. Two observations make this unlikely. First, when the location of reported
hormone-binding domain mutations from other patient collections (18,21-23) are compared with our own, there is predominance of mutations in these regions as well (see Fig. 1 B). Even
the mutation causing androgen resistance in the Tfm rat (27)
falls into the first of these segments. Second, comparison of the
locations of mutations of the androgen receptor with mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor-,8 that have been reported to cause thyroid hormone resistance also suggests that
the clustering is not a coincidence (31, 32). In both the thyroid
and androgen receptors, two clusters of mutations are recognized. The locations of the carboxy-terminal mutations show
little agreement, but the locations of the amino-terminal clusters (726-772 in the androgen receptor and 310-342 in the thyroid hormone receptor hTR-fl) are homologous, suggesting
that this segment plays a critical role in the function of both
receptor proteins. Although fewer in number, amino acid substitutions associated with glucocorticoid resistance (28,29) and
vitamin D resistance (30) are positioned at near or within the
clusters of mutations evident for the androgen receptor (see
Fig. 1 B).

The significance of this clustering of mutations in two segments of the androgen receptor hormone-binding domain is
not clear. The fact that all of these mutations are associated
with abnormal receptor binding suggests that the two regions
may define physical surfaces (e.g., a cleft) important for the
interaction of the receptor with ligand.
The observation that identical mutations in the androgen
receptor gene are associated with different receptor binding
defects or different clinical phenotypes is provocative. These
differences are not caused by differences in the level of immunoreactive receptor detected in fibroblast cultures, suggesting
that genetic determinants outside the androgen receptor coding
segment are able to influence the function of the receptor.
