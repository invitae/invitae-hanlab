Q p e I (tyrosinase-deficient)oculocutaneous
albinism (OCA) results from mutations of the
gene encoding tyrosinase, the enzyme that
catalyzes the first 2 steps of melanin pigment
biosynthesis. In type IA (tyrosinase-negative)
OCA tyrosinase enzymatic activity is completely absent, and in type IB (“yellow”)OCA
tyrosinase activity is greatly reduced. Here,
we describe 11 novel mutations of the tyrosinase gene in Caucasian patients with
these 2 forms of type I OCA. e p e I OCA in
Caucasians appears to result from a great variety of different uncommon alleles. More
than 80%of the known missense substitutions
associated with type I OCA cluster within 2
relativelysmall regions of the tyrosinase polypeptide, suggesting that these may correspond to functionally important sites within
the enzyme. o 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

INTRODUCTION
Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a group of autosoma1 recessive disorders of pigmentation characterized
by greatly reduced or absent biosynthesis of melanin
pigment in melanocytes of the skin, hair follicle, and eye
[reviewed in King and Summers, 1988; Witkop et al.,
19891. Lack of pigment in the skin results in severe
photosensitivity and danger of skin cancer; lack of pigment in the retina results in greatly decreased visual
acuity, photophobia, and nystagmus. Because of the
striking phenotype, OCA has been recognized since a t
least ancient Roman times [Pliny, 1942; Gellius, 19521,

and was suggested by Garrod [1908]to represent a likely
inborn error of metabolism.
Deficient melanin biosynthesis in patients with type I
OCA is the result of deficient activity of melanocyte
tyrosinase (monophenol,L-dopa:oxygen oxidoreductase;
EC 1.14.18.1).Tyrosinase is a copper-containingenzyme
that catalyzes at least the first 2 steps of melanin biosynthesis, the hydroxylation of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and the subsequent dehydrogenation of DOPA to DOPA-quinone [Lerner and
Fitzpatrick, 19501. In type IA (classic tyrosinase-negative) OCA tyrosinase activity and melanin synthesis are
entirely absent; hair is snow-white, and skin and iris
pigmentation are entirely lacking. In type IB (“yellow”)
OCA there is a small amount of tyrosinase activity and
consequent melanin biosynthesis; patients completely
lack apparent melanin pigment a t birth, but may accumulate some pigment, principally the yellow-red pheomelanins, during childhood and adulthood.
Both types IA and IB OCA result from homozygosity
or compound heterozygosity for various mutations of the
tyrosinase structural gene, and a number of different
type IA and IB OCA mutant alleles have recently been
identified [Tomita et al., 1989; Giebel et al., 1990,
1991a,c,d;Kikuchi et al., 1990; Spritz et al., 1990,1991;
Takeda et al., 1990; Chintamaneni et al., 1991; King et
al., 1991; Oetting et al., 1991a,b1. Here, we describe 11
novel tyrosinase gene mutations in Caucasian patients
with type I OCA. Type I OCA thus results from a large
number of different mutations of the tyrosinase gene.
More than 80%of the known tyrosinase missense substitutions associated with type I OCA cluster with 2 relatively small regions of the tyrosinase polypeptide, suggesting the possible locations of functionally important
sites within the enzyme.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Analysis of Hairbulb Qrosinase Activity
Anagen hairbulbs were obtained by scalp epilation
and frozen immediately at - 80°C. Semiquantitative
analyses of hairbulb tyrosinase activity were performed
exactly as described by Witkop et al. [1989].

Tripathi et al.

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Amplification
and Sequencing of Genomic DNA
Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of the probands [Sambrook et al., 19891 and
tyrosinase gene fragments corresponding to the five exons plus adjacent noncoding and flanking sequences
[Giebel et al., 1990bI were amplified independently from
0.1 p,g DNA by 40 cycles of the PCR [Saiki et al., 19881as
described previously [Giebel et al., 1991aI. Amplified
products were purified in 4% polyacrylamide gels,
cloned into bacteriophage vectors M13mp18 or mp19,
and the nucleotide sequences of at least six independent
clones per exon were determined [Sanger et al., 19771.
Allele-Specific Oligonucleotide Hybridization
Tyrosinase exon 1 fragments were PCR amplified
from genomic DNA of proband 2, her unaffected brother
and parents, and 8 unrelated probands with type IA
OCA; these included proband 1,her similarly affected
first cousin, and proband 3, prior to subsequent molecular analyses of these individuals. Twenty microliters of
each PCR reaction was transferred to MAGNA nylon
membranes (Micron Separations) with a Bio-Dot SF microfiltration device (Bio-Rad). Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridizations of replicate filters were performed 1Kogan and Gitschier, 19901 by using
5’-radiolabeled 19-mer oligonucleotides corresponding
to the normal (5’-GGCAACTTCATGGGATTCA-3’)
and
mutant (5’-GGCAACTTCAATGGGATTC-3’)
forms of
codon 96.
Restriction Enzyme Cleavage Analysis
To screen for the codon 403 AGG+ AGT and codon
446 GGC + AGC substitutions, which respectively
abolish BanI and create DdeI cleavage sites, PCRamplified tyrosinase gene exon 4 DNA segments of probands 5 and 6, of 15 additional, unrelated, type IA OCA
probands of northern European Caucasian ethnic origin, and of 20 normal individuals were digested with 40
U DdeI or BanI for 3 hr at 37°C and the cleavage products were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
RESULTS
Description of Probands
Proband 1. A Caucasian girl with typical type IA
(tyrosinase-negative) OCA. Her parents were nonconsanguineous and two sibs were unaffected, but a maternal first-cousin was also affected with type IA OCA.
Proband 2. A Caucasian girl with typical type IA
OCA. Her parents were nonconsanguineous.
Proband 3. A Caucasian man with typical type IA
OCA. Family history is unavailable.
Proband 4. A Caucasian man with typical type IA
OCA. His parents were nonconsanguineous.
Proband 5. A Caucasian boy with type IB (“yellow”) OCA. At birth his phenotype was indistinguishable from type IA OCA; however, by age 1 V z years
significant melanin pigment was observable in his hair,
eyelashes, and skin. His brother, the only sib, was more
severely affected, with a phenotype similar to that of

type IA OCA, and a paternal greatgrandmother was
also said to have been an albino.
Proband 6. A Caucasian man with typical type IA
OCA, a member of an extensive, previously reported
kindred with various types of type I OCA (patient VI of
family 2 in Giebel et al. [19901). A sister was similarly
affected with type IA OCA and 4 sibs were unaffected.
The parents were nonconsanguineous.
Proband 7. A Caucasian man with typical type IA
OCA. Both parents may have been distantly related to
patient 6, and both reported a history of OCA in distant
relatives. Two sibs were unaffected.
Proband 8. A Caucasian woman with typical type
IA OCA. The patient was adopted, and family history is
unavailable.

Hairbulb Qrosinase Activity
Analyses of scalp anagen hairbulbs from all probands
showed no detectable tyrosinase activity.
Identification of Tyrosinase Gene Mutations
To define the molecular basis of type I (tyrosinasedeficient) OCA in these 8 Caucasian probands, we analyzed their tyrosinase genes by PCR amplification, molecular cloning, and subsequent DNA sequencing. The 5
tyrosinase gene exons plus adjacent noncoding sequences were amplified from genomic DNA of each proband using oligonucleotide primers [Giebel et al.,
1991aI derived from the DNA sequence of the normal
human tyrosinase gene [Giebel et al., 1991bI.The DNA
sequence analyses thus included the complete exons
plus adjacent intervening and flanking sequences. In
addition to differences a t several previously identified
nonpathological DNA sequence polymorphisms of the
tyrosinase gene [Giebel and Spritz, 1990; Giebel et al.,
1991b; Tripathi et al., 19911, each of the probands was
found to be a compound heterozygote for mutations that
appear to be specifically associated with type I OCA
(Fig. 1).
Proband 1,with type IA OCA, is a compound heterozygote for two different novel mutant tyrosinase alleles
(Fig. 1A). One allele contains a missense substitution,
codon 21 CCT (Pro) + TCT (Ser). The other allele contains a frameshift resulting from a single-base deletion,
CTT + CT-, within codon 388. Both alleles are associated with TCT (Ser) and CGA (Arg), respectively, at
polymorphic codons 192 [Giebel and Spritz, 19901 and
402 [Tripathi et al., 19911. Both alleles are also associated with a 2.4-kb polymorphic TaqI fragment, resulting from an RFLP located within IVS 1of the tyrosinase
gene [Spritz et al., 19891.
Proband 2, with type IA OCA, is also a compound
heterozygote for two different novel mutant tyrosinase
alleles (Fig. 1B). One allele contains a missense substitution, codon 299 CGT (Arg) + CAT (His). The other
allele contains a frameshift resulting from a single-base
duplication, ATG + AATG, within codon 96. Both alleles are associated with TCT (Ser) and CGA (Arg),
respectively, at polymorphic codons 192 and 402. Allelespecific oligonucleotide hybridization analyses (not
shown) demonstrated that the proband and her father
are heterozygous for the codon 96 mutant allele; her

mother and brother had only the normal form of codon
96. None of 8 unrelated probands with type IA OCA had
the codon 96 mutant allele.
Proband 3, with type IA OCA, is also a compound
heterozygote (Fig. 1C). One allele contains a novel missense substitution, codon 206 GCT (Ala) -+ ACT (Thr).
This allele is associated with TAT (Tyr) and CGA (Arg),
respectively, a t polymorphic codons 192 and 402. The
other allele contained no identifiable difference from
normal in the regions analyzed. This allele is associated
with TCT (Ser) and CGA (Arg), respectively, at polymorphic codons 192 and 402.
Proband 4, with type IA OCA, is also a compound
heterozygote for two different mutant tyrosinase alleles
(Fig. ID). One allele contains a missense substitution,
codon 81 CCT (Pro) + CTT (Leu), that we described
previously [Giebel et al., 1990al. This allele was associated with TAT (Tyr) and CGA (Arg), respectively, a t
polymorphic codons 192 and 402. The other allele contains a novel missense substitution, codon 217 CGG
(Arg) -+ TGG (Trp). This allele is associated with TCT
(Ser) and CGA (Arg), respectively, a t polymorphic codons 192 and 402.
Proband 5, with type IB OCA, is also a compound
heterozygote for 2 different novel mutant tyrosinase
alleles (Fig. 1E). One allele contains a missense substitution, codon 403 AGG (Arg) -+ AGT (Ser). The other
allele also contains a novel missense substitution, codon
448 GAC (Asp) -+ AAC (Asn). Both alleles are associated with TCT (Ser) and CGA (Arg), respectively, a t
polymorphic codons 192 and 402. The codon 403 GAC
-+ AAC substitution destroys a cleavage site for BanI
(GGYRCC);therefore, we were able to easily confirm the
presence of this mutation in the proband and test for the
presence of this mutation in his affected brother and
their parents. A 362-bp segment containing exon 4 of the
tyrosinase gene was PCR-amplified from genomic
DNAs of the proband, his brother and parents, and 20
unrelated, normal Caucasian individuals, digested with
BanI, and the cleavage products were analyzed by gel
electrophoresis. The exon 4 PCR product derived from
alleles containing the normal form of codon 403 (GAC)
contains a single BanI site, and is thus cleaved by BanI
into two fragments, sized 125 and 237 bp. In contrast,
those derived from the mutant form of codon 403 (AAC)
are not cleaved by B a d . BanI cleavage analysis of the
exon 4 PCR products derived from the proband, his
brother, and their father demonstrated a mixed pattern,
indicating heterozygosity for the codon 403 mutant allele. In contrast, their mother and all of the 20 normal
individuals showed only the normal BanI pattern (data
not shown). Thus, the codon 403 mutation is not a common nonpathological polymorphism. Furthermore, we
have subsequently observed the codon 448 mutant allele
in a n unrelated man with classic type IA OCA (unpublished data); we thus conclude that this allele is
specifically associated with type IA OCA. Proband 5,
who has a phenotype of type IB OCA, therefore is a type
IA/type IB OCA compound heterozygote; the codon 403
mutant allele is thus specifically associated with type IB
OCA.
Proband 6, with type IA OCA, is also a compound

heterozygote (Fig. 1F). One allele contains a novel missense substitution, codon 446 GGC (Gly) -+ AGC (Ser).
The other allele contained no identifiable difference
from normal in the regions analyzed. Both alleles were
associated with TCT (Ser) and CGA (Arg), respectively,
at polymorphic codons 192 and 402. The codon 446 GGG-+ GAG substitution creates a novel cleavage site for
DdeI (CTNAG);therefore, we were able to easily confirm
the presence of this mutation in the proband‘s genomic
DNA. A 362-bp fragment of the tyrosinase gene exon 4
was PCR-amplified from genomic DNAs of the proband
and 20 normal Caucasian individuals, digested with
DdeI, and analyzed by electrophoresis. The exon 4 PCR
products derived from all 20 normal individuals contained only 1DdeI site and thus were cleaved to yield 2
fragments, sized 70 and 292 bp. In contrast, DdeI digestion of the exon 4 PCR products derived from the proband, who is heterozygous for the codon 446 substitution, resulted in a mixed pattern. One allele yielded the
normal fragments described above. However, the other
allele, as expected, contained a n additional DdeI site,
and yielded the predicted 70-, 108-, and 184-bp cleavage
products (data not shown). These data confirm that the
proband is heterozygous for the codon 446 mutation, and
indicate that it is not a common nonpathological polymorphism.
Proband 7, with type IA OCA, is also a compound
heterozygote for two different mutant tyrosinase alleles
(Fig. 1G). One allele contains a missense substitution,
codon 383 GAT (Asp) -+ AAT (Asn), that we described
previously [Spritz et al., 19901. The other allele contains
a novel frameshift, resulting from a single-base duplication, ACT -+ ACTT, within codon 489. Both alleles are
associated with CGA (Arg) a t the polymorphic codon
402. The proband is heterozygous TAT/TCT a t the polymorphic codon 192. Although we have not determined
the phase relationship in this proband, in a n independent proband the codon 383 mutant allele was associated with codon 192 TAT (Tyr) [Spritz e t al., 1990; unpublished data].
Proband 8, with type IA OCA, is also a compound
heterozygote for two different mutant tyrosinase alleles
(Fig. 1H). One allele contains a missense substitution,
codon 373 ACA (Thr) -+ AAA (Lys), that we described
previously [Spritz et al., 19901.The other allele contains
a novel missense mutation, codon 382 AAC
(Asn) -+ AAA (Lys). Both alleles are associated with
TAT (Tyr) and CGA (Arg), respectively, at polymorphic
codons 192 and 402.

DISCUSSION
Type I OCA is a n uncommon autosomal recessive disorder of pigmentation in which deficient synthesis of
melanin pigment results from mutations of the gene
encoding tyrosinase, the copper-containing enzyme that
catalyzes the first 2 steps in the melanin biosynthetic
pathway [Witkop et al., 19891.Two principal subtypes of
type I OCA have been distinguished on the basis of
clinical and biochemical criteria. In type IA (tyrosinasenegative) OCA, the classic form of the disorder, tyrosinase activity and melanin synthesis are entirely
absent. In type IB (“yellow”) OCA there is a small

amount of tyrosinase activity and melanin synthesis.
Recently, we and others have shown that both forms of
type I OCA result from homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for various combinations of a number of
mutant tyrosinase alleles associated with decreased or
absent catalytic activity or stability. Eighteen different
tyrosinase gene mutations associated with various
forms of type I OCA have been reported previously
[Tomita et al., 1989; Giebel et al., 1990, 1991a,c,d;
Kikuchiet al., 1990;Kinget al., 1991;Spritzetal., 1990,
1991; Takeda et al., 1990; Chintamaneni et al., 1991;
Oetting et al., 1991a,bl, principally among Caucasians.
Here, we describe 11novel tyrosinase gene mutations in

869

8 Caucasian probands with type I OCA, expanding the
number of known type I OCA alleles to 29 (Table I).
Recently, four of these, the codons 96,206,382, and 490
mutant alleles, were reported independently by other
investigators [Chintamaneni et al., 1991; King et al.,
1991; Oetting et al., 19911.
Three of the novel tyrosinase gene mutations described here are frameshifts. Proband 1has a one-base
deletion (CTT + CT-1 within codon 388 (Fig. lA), resulting in a substantial distal nonsense polypeptide that
terminates within codon 484. Proband 2 has a one-base
insertion (AAG- AATG) within codon 96 (Fig. IB),
resulting in a distal nonsense polypeptide that terminates within codon 168. Proband 7 has a one-base insertion (ACT--$ ACTT) within codon 489 (Fig. lG), resulting in a distal nonsense polypeptide that terminates
within codon 509. Four additional tyrosinase gene
frameshifts have been reported, involving codons 191,
244, 310, and 501 [Tomita et al., 1989; Giebel et al.,
1991d; Oetting et al., 1991bI. Thus, a total of 7 tyrosinase gene frameshifts associated with type IA OCA
have now been identified.
Eight of the novel tyrosinase gene mutations described here are missense substitutions, bringing the
total number of known tyrosinase gene missense substitutions associated with type I OCA to 21 (Table I). Most
interestingly, the distribution of these substitutions
along the 529-amino acid tyrosinase polypeptide is not

random (this was also recently pointed out by King and
co-workers [1971]).As shown in Fig. 2, seventeen of the
21 missense substitutions (81%)cluster into 2 relatively
small segments that together comprise only 29% of the
511-aminoacid mature tyrosinase polypeptide. Seven of
these, a t codons 21,42,47, 55,77, 81, and 89, comprise
one cluster, near the amino terminus of mature tyrosinase. However, one of these, the novel codon 21 CCT
(Pro) + TCT (Ser) substitution described here, occurs
only three residues distal to the site of cleavage of the 18amino acid leader peptide [Wittbjer et al. 19891. This
substitution might thus interfere with posttranslational cleavage of the tyrosinase leader peptide (although this has yet to be investigated), and therefore
may not be appropriately grouped with the other more
distal substitutions in this cluster which likely affect
some other property of tyrosinase.
Ten of the 21 known tyrosinase missense substitutions (48%) comprise a second mutation cluster, from
codons 371 to 448. This segment, which represents only
15% of the mature tyrosinase polypeptide, corresponds
closely to the histidine-rich “Cu B” region of very strong
homology between mammalian tyrosinases and arthropod and molluscan hemocyanin, a copper-containing oxygen transport protein [reviewed in Lerch, 1988; Hearing and Jimenez, 19891. Thus, this region of the
tyrosinase polypeptide may be involved in binding of
copper, which is necessary for catalytic activity. Although Martinez et al. [1985] suggested that histidines
in this region might mediate copper binding by tyrosinase, none of the type I OCA mutations in this region involves histidine residues. Three of the 4 mutations specifically associated with type IB (“yellow”)
OCA, in which tyrosinase activity is greatly reduced but
not abolished, occur in the center of this cluster, at
codons 403, 406, and 422. Moreover, a fourth substitution in this region, a t codon 402, is also associated with
reduced tyrosinase activity, although it does not result
in OCA [Tripathi et al., 19911. At least three of these
four substitutions, a t codons 402,406, and 422, are associated with temperature-sensitive enzymatic activity of
the correspondingtyrosinase polypeptides [Giebel et al.,
1991c; Tripathi et al., 1991; our unpublished data]. It
may therefore be that substitutions in this region are
particularly likely to result in temperature-sensitive
tyrosinase polypeptides, but with appreciable residual
enzymatic activity in a t least some instances.
These 2 clusters of human tyrosinase missense substitutions appear to be mirrored in murine tyrosinase gene
(c-locus)mutations. The classic mouse albino allele contains a missense substitution at codon 103 [Jackson and
Bennett, 1990; Shibahara et al., 1990; Yokoyama et al.,
19901,just downstream of the amino-terminal cluster of
human OCA mutations described here. The mouse himalayan allele contains a missense substitution a t codon 420 [Kwon et al., 19891 and the mouse chinchilla
allele a missense substitution a t codon 482 [Beerman et
al., 19901. Interestingly, the mouse himalayan mutation, like the human OCA mutations in this region, also
results in temperature sensitivity of the corresponding
tyrosinase polypeptide.

In contrast, very few type I OCA missense substitutions have been found in the central region of the tyrosinase polypeptide. Two of the missense substitutions
reported here, codon 206 GCT (Ala) -+ACT (Thr) (Fig.
1C) and codon 217 CGG (Arg) + TGG (Ser) (Fig. lD),
occur within the so-called “Cu A” region of weak amino
acid sequence similarity between mammalian tyrosinases and arthropod and molluscan hemocyanin [reviewed in Lerch, 1988; Hearing and Jimenez, 19891.
Based on this apparent homology, these investigators
suggested that the “Cu A” segment might also be important for binding of atomic copper by these proteins. However, our subsequent more comprehensive comparisons
that include the many additional hemocyanin sequences now available indicate that this putative sequence “homology” may not be significant [data not
shown]. Of the other two known missense substitutions
in the central portion of tyrosinase, one, a t codon 275
[Giebel et al., 1991d1, is associated with type IB OCA,
and the other, at codon 299 (Fig. 1B)with type IA OCA.
How might the 2 clusters of missense substitutions
relate to the functional properties of tyrosinase? Tyrosinase is a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes at
least the first two steps of melanin biosynthesis: its
hydroxylase activity catalyzes the conversion of tyrosine to DOPA and its dehydrogenase activity catalyzes the subsequent conversion of DOPA to DOPAquinone [Lerner and Fitzpatrick, 19501.Tyrosinase also
appears to catalyze distal steps in the melanin biosynthetic pathway, including the dehydrogenation of
both 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) and 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) to quinone derivatives. It is not unlikely that the various catalytic activities of tyrosinase reside in at least two distinct catalytic
sites in the polypeptide: one involved primarily in hydroxylation of tyrosine and another involved in dehydrogenation of various dihydroxy aromatic substrates.
Assay of the specific enzymatic activities associated
with the various “mutant” tyrosinases may therefore
shed light on the locations of these catalytic sites within
the tyrosinase polypeptide.
All of the probands studied here are compound heterozygotes for different type I OCA mutant alleles. Among
Caucasians with type I OCA, we and others [Giebel et
al., 1990,1991c,d; Spritz et al., 1990; Chintamaneni et
al. 1991; King at al., 1991; Oetting et al., 1991a,b; this
report; our unpublished data] have characterized more
than 80 independent mutant alleles by either nucleotide
sequence of allele-specificoligonucleotide hybridization
analyses, identifying a total of 29 different pathological
mutations. As shown in Table I, only 2 mutant alleles
are reasonably frequent. The codon 81 CCT + CTT and
codon 373 ACA -+ AAA mutant alleles both occur with
approximate frequencies of 15%.All of the other mutant
alleles are relatively uncommon, and several have been
identified only once. Furthermore, approximately 10%
of OCA “mutant” alleles studied contained no identifiable abnormality. Hemizygosity can be excluded in all of
these cases and, on the basis of the polymorphisms at
codons 192 and 402, this group apparently consists of at
least four distinct alleles. It is likely that the patholog-

Tyrosinase Gene Mutations in Oculocutaneous Albinism
ical mutations in these OCA alleles occur within intervening or flanking sequences, far from the exons and
thus outside of the regions subjected to DNA sequence
analysis. Type I OCA is thus a heterogeneous disorder
among Caucasians, resulting from homozygosity or
compound heterozygosity for a large number of different
mutations of the tyrosinase gene. The genetic complexity underlying this disorder complicates molecular approaches to carrier detection or prenatal diagnosis, except in specific ethnic groups or genetic isolates, such as
the Amish, in whom one particular mutant allele is
particularly prevalent [Giebel et al., 1991dI.
