INTRODUCTION

Hunter syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis type II
(MPS II) is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by an
absence or reduction of the lysosomal housekeeping enzyme ol-L-iduronate sulfate sulfatase (IDS). This leads
to accumulation of the incompletely degraded mucopolysaccharides heparan and dermatan sulfate (McKusick
and Neufeld, 1983; Spranger, 1984; Benson and Fensom,
1985; Bielicki et al., 1990). Symptoms of the disease include short stature, coarse facial features, stiff joints,
progressive deafness, and mental retardation. Heart disease, resulting from a combination of valvular, myocardial, and ischemic factors, is the usual cause of death,
and severely affected males die before adulthood, although milder cases have reached their eighth decade
and have been capable of reproduction (Hobolth and Pedersen, 1978). It has been estimated that the incidence of
Hunter syndrome is 7.5 per million male live births
(Young et al., 1982), but a higher number (14.8 per mil1 To whom

lion) of male live births has been proposed for the Ashkenazi Jewish population (Schaap and Bach, 1980).
Clinical diagnosis is based upon measuring IDS activity in peripheral white blood cells and serum and/or detecting accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in urine
(Benson and Fensom, 1985). Carrier status is presently
determined by enzyme assay for IDS in blood samples or
preferably hair roots (Yutaka et al., 1978; Archer et al.,
1982; Chase et al., 1986). Enzyme assays in blood samples, however, have been shown to be ambiguous in at
least 15% of obligate carriers (Zlotogora and Bach,
1984). Better results can be obtained by hair root analysis (Chase et al., 1986), but absolute certainty is not
achieved. Also, linked restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) do not provide definite carrier
diagnosis, and therefore more accurate and direct methods for carrier detection are required. These must be
based on the direct detection of the gene defect as illustrated for example by work on hemophilia B (Green et
al., 1989; 1991a,b; Montandon et al., 1989).
A full-length cDNA clone of 2.3-kb coding for the human IDS gene has recently been cloned and sequenced
(Wilson et al., 1990). An open reading frame of 1650 bp
was identified. The predicted 550 residue amino acid sequence includes 25 residues of signal sequence and 8 residues of propeptide sequence. As pointed out by Wilson et
al. (1990), human IDS shares homology with several
other sulfatase enzymes, including human arylsulfatases
A, B, and C, human glucosamine-6-sulfatase, and sea
urchin arylsulfatase (Yen et al., 1987; Robertson et al.,
1988; Sasaki et al., 1988; Stein et al., 1989a,b; Peters et
al., 1990). The IDS cDNA clone has been used as a probe
to screen 23 severely affected Hunter syndrome patients
for gene deletions and rearrangements (Wilson et al.,
1990). Seven patients were found to have a deletion or
rearrangement, and further analysis of these showed
that two patients had deletions that removed the entire
IDS gene. The remaining patients had either small deletions or point mutations, which were not detected by the
method used.
Here we describe the characterization of the Hunter
syndrome mutation in each of a group of six patients
analyzed using an approach that detects all types of mutations that affect the structure and/or stability of the

PCR amplification
ofgenomic DNA.
Genomic
DNA was amplified
in the first instance
using primer
pairs specific to the 5’ and 3’ ends of
the gene coding for IDS (IDS C/41 and IDS D/E, respectively)
(see
Table 1). All PCRs were in a total volume of 50 pl containing
67 mM
Tris-HCl,
pH 8.8, 16.6 n&f ammonium
sulfate, 6.7 m&f magnesium
chloride,
170 #g/ml bovine
serum albumin,
and 10 m&f 2-mercaptoethanol,
30 ng of each primer,
2.5 units Amplitaq
Taq polymerase
(Perkin-Elmer/Cetus),
and approximately
lo-20
ng of DNA template. Thirty
cycles of amplification
were carried
out (93”C/l
min,
6O”C/l
min, 72”C/3
min).
The polyadenylation
region was also amplified
from genomic DNA
using the primers
pAd 1 and pAd 2 (see Table 1). Conditions
used were
as described
above and amplification
was for 30 cycles of 93”C/l
min,
58”C/l
min, 72”C/3
min. Products
of all PCR reactions
were separated on 2.5% agarose gels and purified
from gels using geneclean
(Bio
101). Then, 100-200
ng of gel-purified
reactions
were sequenced
by
the dideoxy
chain termination
method
(Sanger et al., 1977; Green et
al., 1989).
Reverse transcription
and PCR amplification.
RNA (200 to 500 ng)
was reverse transcribed
prior to PCR amplification.
A total of 50 ng of
the appropriate
primer
was annealed
to 200-500
ng of RNA in a volume of 10 @I TE buffer at 65°C for 10 min. After snap cooling on ice,
reactions
were made up to 20 pl with 4 ~1 5~ reverse transcriptase
buffer
(BRL),
5 ~1 5 mM dNTPs,
25 units RNase inhibitor
(Boehringer Mannheim),
and 200 units Molony
murine
leukemia
virus reverse transcriptase
(BRL).
Reactions
were incubated
at 42°C for 1 h,
and 20 ~1 of cDNA was amplified
using the conditions
described
above.

IDS protein. The approach consists of two main stages.
In the first stage, patient DNAs are screened for the
presence of the IDS gene sequence using polymerase
chain reactions (PCR) that define two genomic regions,
one specific for the 5’ and the other for the 3’ end of the
gene. Patients shown not to have a large deletion by this
method are then analyzed in the second stage. IDS
cDNA derived from primary fibroblast cultures or peripheral blood lymphocytes is amplified. Any interstitial
deletions or rearrangements not affecting the 5’ or 3’ genomic PCRs will be detected by loss or alteration of one
of these reactions. Regions in which no such changes are
found are then screened for mutations by mismatch detection analysis (Montandon et al., 1989) using the chemical cleavage method of Cotton et al. (1988). All mutations are then characterized by sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method (Sanger et al., 1977)
adapted for double-stranded sequencing (Green et al.,
1989) and confirmed by subsequent analysis of the appropriate segment of genomic DNA.

PCR reaction
detecting
the anonymous
proximal
marker VKZlC (DXS269)
(Suthers et al., 1989) (results
not shown). However,
the sample was positive for an
STS representing
U6.2 (DXS304)
(Rousseau
et al.,
1990), which showed the ability of the DNA to act as a
template for amplification.
Patient 1 therefore presumably has a deletion of the whole IDS gene extending
proximally
at least as far as DXS269 in Xq27.3.
The remaining five patients were positive for the 5’and 3’-specific PCR reactions (see Figs. la and lb). To
screen these patients for point mutations,
total RNA
was first extracted from primary fibroblast cultures. The
IDS mRNA was reverse transcribed
in two overlapping
sections using primers IDS L and IDS B for the 5’ (A)
and 3’ (B) sections, respectively,
and then amplified by
two nested PCR reactions using the primer pairs IDS
C/L and IDS V/N for section A and IDS O/B and IDS
P/D for section B (Table 1 and Fig. 2). The polyadenylation region was amplified from genomic DNA and sequenced directly without detection of any significant abnormality. The overlapping, amplified cDNA sections A
and B were then subjected to chemical mismatch analysis to identify and locate any point mutation or mRNA
abnormality.
The mutations are summarized in Table 2.
Mismatch analysis of patients 2-4 and 6 resulted in detection of a single mismatch band in either reaction A or

ET

AL.

B in each case. Such a band could be elicited however by
either hydroxylamine
or osmium tetroxide (see for example patient 3 reaction B, track 5, Fig. 3). In patient 5, two
mismatch bands were detected, one in each section of
the cDNA (see Fig. 3, track 3 in the hydroxylamine
reaction for the band in reaction B; result not shown for
reaction A).
To characterize
fully the cDNA defects revealed by
the mismatch analysis the appropriate
segments of the
amplified section A and/or B were sequenced directly
using either PCR or ad hoc primers. This revealed that
in patient 2, the mismatch band of 550 nt in section A
was due to a C + T transition
at residue 638, which
converted the Arg,,, codon into a translation
stop signal
(Fig. 4a, Table 2). The mutation was confirmed by sequence analysis of the coding region amplified from genomic DNA using a primer derived from an intron sequence paired with a cDNA-specific
primer.
In patient 3 the 500-nt band seen with both chemicals
in section B is due to the loss of 60 bp of cDNA extending
from nucleotide position 1244 to 1305 (Table 2, Figs. 4b
and 5). Analysis of this region of the patients’ genomic
DNA showed that the sequence absent from the cDNA
was present in genomic DNA, but that a C + T transition had occurred in a nucleotide corresponding
to position 1246 of the cDNA (the sequence change in the antisense strand is shown in Fig. 4~). This does not alter the
amino acid sequence but creates a donor splice site
(CAGGCGAGA
+ CAGGTGAGA).
As a result, part of
this exon [nts 1245-1304 of the cDNA (Wilson
et al.,
1990)] is spliced out in the mature mRNA along with the
normal intron sequence prior to nucleotide
1305. To
demonstrate
the preferential
use of the novel splice site
in patient 3, the size of the PCR product from reaction B
was compared with that of a normal sample. The amplified cDNA derived from the patient consisted
exclusively of a shorter product (1032 nts; see track 2, Fig. 6)
compared to the normal control. Existence of an exon
boundary following
nucleotide 1304 of the cDNA was
confirmed by sequencing normal genomic DNA (unpublished results).
In patient 4, the mismatch band of 400 nt in section B
is caused by a C + T transition
at nucleotide 1122 that
was also found in genomic DNA using a primer complementary to nearby intron sequence and results in substitution of serine 333by leucine (Fig. 4d, Table 2).
In patient 5 the mismatch band of 460 nt in section A
is due to a C + T transition
at nucleotide position 562
(seen in both genomic and cDNA), which causes a silent
change in the codon for threonine,,,
(ACC to ACT). The
second mismatch band in this patient, the 200-nt band
in section B, is due to a G + C transversion
at nucleotide
1629. This causes the substitution
of tryptophan,,,
by
serine (Fig. 4e, Table 2), a change that was confirmed in
genomic DNA.
Finally, in patient 6 the mismatch band of 500 nt in
section A is due to a C + G transversion
at position 603
that converts
Pro,,, to Arg (Fig. 4f, Table 2), as also
demonstrated
in genomic DNA.

DISCUSSION

In every one of the six patients analyzed, a mutation
was found that can be considered the cause of the disease. This is beyond any doubt in patient 1, where the

whole gene was deleted and in patient 2, where a stop
codon at position 172 causes the functional loss of most
of the coding sequence. In patient 3,20 amino acids are
lost from a relatively well-conserved
region of the sulfatases, and this also represents
a gross abnormality

hydrophobic group of the tryptophan is replaced by the
small polar serine side chain. This change occurs in a
very hydrophobic domain (VLJVGF + VSVGF) and is
therefore likely to cause a significant reduction in the
stability or activity of the enzyme. This latter patient
also shows a translationally silent change that is expected to be neutral. Whether this represents a common
polymorphism is not yet known. Finally, the Pro,, +
Arg substitution of patient 6 is also a nonconservative
change, which in this case involves the amino acid proline, which frequently has important structural roles.
It is interesting to note that four out of six of the single
nucleotide changes described in this study were C + T
transitions occurring at the CpG dinucleotide (C,,, --f T
in patient 2, C,,,, + T in patient 3, C,,,, + T in patient
4, and %, + T in patient 5). This result agrees with
earlier observations that the CpG dinucleotide is a “hotspot” for mutations within the mammalian genome
(Bird, 1980; Green et d., 1990).
The procedure that we used to detect the mutation of
the above patients makes use of amplified cDNA. This
reduces the work required to characterize the mutation
because the mRNA presents the coding sequence in a
continuous stretch, a property that has also been invaluable in the characterization of the mutations of large and
complex genes, such as those for factor VIII and dystrophin (Naylor et al., 1991; Roberts et al., 1991). Thus two
nested PCR reactions applied after first-strand cDNA
synthesis allow the isolation of the whole coding sequence of the IDS gene as two purified and abundant
overlapping segments. A total of four chemical mismatch reactions then identify and locate any mutation,
thus reducing to a minimum the sequencing required to
fully characterize the mutation. Another advantage of
analyzing sequence changes at the level of the cDNA is
that the effects of mutations on RNA splicing may be
directly identified. This is clearly illustrated by patient
3, where a single base substitution in an exon creates a
new donor splice site and causes the loss of 60 nt from
the message. Analysis of the patient cDNA (see Fig. 6
and Results) clearly indicates that the new donor site is
the functional site in patient 3, a fact that could not have
been definitely predicted from the knowledge of the single base substitution observed in genomic DNA because
the rules governing mRNA splicing are not yet well defined. Furthermore, the findings in patient 3 are in keeping with the “exon definition” hypothesis (Robberson et
al., 1990). According to this hypothesis the spliceosome
begins to assemble at the 3’ end of an intron, followed by
a search for a downstream donor splice that together
with the 5’ acceptor site defines the exon. The new donor
splice site in patient 3 may therefore be preferred to the
natural splice site because it is closer than the latter to
the preceding acceptor site.
Analysis of genomic DNA is required to confirm the
mutation seen in patients cDNA, especially as illustrated for patient 3. Additionally, a PCR reaction was
used to analyze the cleavage polyadenylation signal region of the gene, since mutations of these sites are

known to be detrimental in the globin genes (Orkin et al.,
1985). The promoter should also be analyzed in genomic
DNA, but such a region of the IDS gene has not been
defined yet and we have not examined it.
In conclusion, we have characterized the mutation of 6
patients with Hunter syndrome by a procedure that
should be capable of detecting most types of mutations
that affect function and/or stability of the IDS protein
or mRNA. The efficiency of mutation detection relies on
the ability of the chemical mismatch procedure to detect
all types of point mutation. From previous studies in
hemophilia B (Green et al., 1991a, and unpublished), the
mutation in 160 out of a total of 161 unrelated patients
with the diseasewas identified using this approach. The
one patient in whom no mutation was detected by mismatch analysis was shown by complete sequence analysis to lack a mutation within the essential regions of the
factor IX gene. This indicated that the inability to find
the mutation was not due to failure of the chemical mismatch technique.
The method described above should allow carrier and
prenatal diagnosis based on the direct detection of the
gene defect according to the strategy previously developed for hemophilia B (Green et al., 1991b).
