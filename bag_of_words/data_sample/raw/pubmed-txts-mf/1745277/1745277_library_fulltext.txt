This report describes a large consanguineous family with muscular dystrophy in 23 patients showing intrafamilial variation of clinical expression. One
main variant appeared in the first decade with proximal muscle weakness
progressing over the next 20 years to wheelchair confinement, and appeared compatible with classical limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The other
main variant showed onset of distal muscle weakness in lower limbs in the
third or fourth decade, progressing very slowly without greater disability
throughout the lifetime. Tibia1 muscle weakness and wasting were clinical
landmarks in this variant, but computed tomography of skeletal muscle revealed focal areas of fatty degeneration also in truncal, pelvifemoral, and
distal leg muscles in a way not previously reported in distal myopathy. The
overall difference in clinical findings between these main variants would
suggest 2 separate genetic entities, genealogical data makes a common
genetic background possible.

MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY WITH
SEPARATE CLINICAL PHENOTYPES
IN A LARGE FAMILY

and HANNU SOMER, MD, PhD

While rapid progress continues to be made in the
understanding of basic molecular defects in
x-linked muscular dystrophies,*l little is known to
date about the molecular defects behind other
muscular dystrophies. T h e clinical picture of limbgirdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is variable,
and different families often have their own clinical
features. Whether this is due to different genes or
simply a manifestation of clinical heterogeneity is
unknown. There have been considerable problems in defining the entity of LGMD, and the
term “limb- irdle syndromes” has, therefore, been
intr~duced!~ We describe a large family with dif-

and clinical heterogeneity in muscular dystrophy.

STUDY DESIGN, PATIENTS AND METHODS

A multigeneration family, containing several hundred members from the rural district of Larsmo
in Finland, was investigated genealogically
through parish records, historical archives, and
private sources. T h e diagnosis of LGMD was
made on index subjects suffering from a severe
muscle disease in 1982. Characteristic findings
were excessive muscular weakness and atrophy affecting predominantly proximal muscles with no
pseudohypertrophy o r myotonia. Serum creatine
kinase activity was elevated, electromyographic examination showed myopathic changes, and muscle
biopsy findings were compatible with muscular
dystrophy .
During subsequent years, new cases of milder
myopathy were discovered, and their relationship
to the index family was confirmed. Altogether, 18
patients belonging to the family have been examined. A detailed neurological re-examination was
performed on 14 of them for this study. Five further subjects were considered to have had muscle
disease by history.

measured in 16 patients. Thirteen patients had
more than 1 CK analysis, the time between them
varying up to 11 years. Activity levels were correlated against the upper normal limit, since laboratory methods and limits have changed during the
years of follow-up.

Examinations
carried out on 14 patients, with needle-electromyography (EMG) on multiple muscles in both
upper and lower limbs and, occasionally, on paravertebral muscles. Both motor and sensory nerve
conduction velocities (NCV) were measured in upper and lower extremities. Electrocardiograms
were obtained from 14 patients.

very limited until this century. Consanguineous
marriages have been common as far back as family histories can be traced to the 17th century.
The family tree was traced back for 11 generations. All affected members proved to be descendents of the same ancestor parents: I/1 born in
1659, and his first wife I/2 (Fig. 1). Patients were
not aware of these relationships.

Electrophysiological Examinations.

“Semi-o en” muscle biopsies were
taken with conchotome’ from lateral vastus muscle in 6 patients, from tibia1 anterior muscle in 3
patients, and from gastrocnemius muscle in 3 patients. One patient had a muscle biopsy taken
from semimembranosus muscle, and another patient from both quadriceps and biceps muscles.
The muscle was frozen rapidly in isopentene
cooled with liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections of
1O-pm thickness were stained using hematoxylin
and eosin (HE), rapid trichrome, NADH-TR, and
myosin adenosine triphosphatase (ATP) methods,
the latter after preincubation in buffers with pH
values of 9.4, 4.6, and 4.3, re~pectively.~

Imaging Methods. In 13 patients, computed tomography (CT) was performed with a C T 8800
scanner (General Electric). Ten-millimeter thick
sections of leg, thigh, hip, and shoulder muscles
were obtained. Ultrasonography (US) of the same
muscle groups was also performed with a 7.5 MHz
probe (Toshiba). In 5 patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed with a low
field resistive system operating at 0.02 Tesla (Instrumentarium). Transaxial, 1O-mm thick sections
of legs and thighs were obtained. Chest X-rays
and echocardiographic examinations were made
on specific indications.

RESULTS

All known generations of
the family have been living on an island in Larsmo
archipelago off the west coast of Finland. The island has been inhabited since the middle ages,
and the origin of its population is unknown. Migration between the island and the mainland was

Case Reports

Subject Xl23. Pregnancy and early developmental milestones were unremarkable. Clear muscle symptoms were already apparent at the age 7,
as he could not run with other children. He never
learned to skate, but was able to ski until the age
of 10. He completed his ordinary schooling at the
age of 16. At 24, he could not walk anymore. He
is now 47 and lives in an apartment for the disabled.
On neurological examination, at age 40, he
showed generalized atrophy and weakness in all
muscles except erector spinae, head, and neck
muscles. He could move his upper extremities
against gravity and was able to carry out daily activities such as eating, washing, and shaving. His
serum CK value was twice the upper normal limit.
EMG revealed polyphasic units of low amplitudes
in all limb muscles. Muscle biopsy showed atrophy, fat, and fibrosis with great variation in fiber
size. No neurogenic changes could be found.
At age 47 he could not elevate his arms, and
barely had the strength to flex his fingers. He
could hardly move his toes or ankles, but despite
that he showed no vertebral scoliosis or joint contractures. He was able to maintain his trunk erect
and showed no sign of dysarthria, facial muscle
weakness, or dysphagia. Myotonia, muscular hypertrophy, or sensory changes were not detected,
and all tendon reflexes were absent. Imaging
methods confirmed severe loss of muscular structures in all examined muscles, most pronounced
in proximal limb muscles.
Subject X/45. Developmental milestones were
normal and medical history was unremarkable. As
a youngster he was active in sports. During his
military service, at age 22, he noticed aching in leg
muscles after very long marches. This symptom
persisted and he subsequently gave up athletic activities. At age 39, he observed weakness in lifting
toes and feet. The symptom was progressing
slowly. On examination at age 44 he could not
walk on his heels and had reduced strength in
dorsiflexion of ankles and toes. Tibia1 anterior

muscles were wasted. All the other muscles were
normal in outlook and in strength.
CK was twice the upper normal limit. Electrocardiogram was normal. EMG was normal in humeral, pelvic, paravertebral, and calf muscles as in
interosseal and extensor brevis muscles. Only the
left tibial anterior muscle showed myopathic
changes. Muscle biopsy from lateral vastus muscle
was normal except for an increased number of internal nuclei (Fig. 2B). Ultrasonography and C T
scans, in particular, revealed fatty involvement of
both tibial anterior muscles and similar focal
changes in the left soleus muscle.
Summary of Case Histories and Clinical Findings. (Table 1.). Seven patients (IW16, 1x144, IW54,

1x155, W17, X18, W23) showed profound proximal muscle weakness and atrophy. T h e symptoms
varied widely with regard to the age of onset, the
progression rate, and severity. Three patients (IW
44, IW54, IW55) showed good distal strength and

were able to walk at an advanced age. Their deep
tendon reflexes were usually preserved. Four patients also displayed severe distal weakness and total loss of deep-tendon reflexes, and they were severely disabled in early adulthood. Patient IX/ 12
died in 1983 before we had an opportunity to see
him. According to records of clinical examination,
at the age of 55, the onset and progress of muscular weakness and disability were similar to the history related in the case report of patient X/23.
T h e other 10 patients had distal leg muscle
weakness and their proximal muscular strength
was within the normal range. Walking became
clumsy around the age of 40. In some cases, the
onset was delayed into their 60s. Three of the
male patients experienced aching in their leg muscles after strenuous physical activity even decades
before the distal leg muscle weakness appeared.
Vague proximal weakness in lower limbs was
found in 3 subjects, but otherwise, muscle weakness and atrophy was confined to tibial anterior

muscles only. Three patients showed some
pseudohypertrophy in the upper extremities.
No sign of scoliosis, sensory impairment, muscular fasciculation or myotonia was detected in
any patient. Patients with the profound muscular
atrophy had some tight tendons in arms and legs,
but no real contractures.
None of the patients had symptoms of cardiomyopathy. However, one patient (W17) had
chronic atrial fibrillation. He died of an acute
heart attack at the age of 55. An autopsy was not
carried out. Another patient (W16) had occasional
cardiac arrhythmias.
Summary of Laboratory and Neurophysiological Results. (Table 2.). Creatine kinase activity was found

to be moderately increased, 1.5 to 2 times the upper normal limit, in 6 patients with proximal muscle weakness. In 8 patients with distal leg muscle
weakness, CK increases varied from 1.5 to 4 times
the upper normal limit. One patient in the
former, and 2 patients in the latter group had

normal CK levels (Table 2). Patient W15 was analyzed 7 times in 11 years, and the CK activity varied from normal to 3.5 times the upper normal
limit.
Electromyographic and NCV studies revealed
no sign of neurogenic disorder (Table 2). In patients with profound proximal muscle weakness, all
the examined muscles showed myopatic changes
except for interosseal muscles in IW54, and extensor brevis muscles in IW55. In the distal leg muscle weakness group, 1 patient (IX/17) who had
been treated with cytostatic drugs for a gynecological malignancy, showed moderately decreased
sensory NCV and findings suggestive of bilateral
carpal tunnel syndrome. Otherwise, EMG findings
were consistent with myopathic changes in tibial
extensor muscles in all 10 patients. Two patients
had minor myopathic changes in more than one
other muscle group. In all the 6 patients tested,
extensor brevis muscles were normal. Two patients also showed signs of lumbar radiculopathy
(W40, W20).

found in 2 patients (IW54,IW55). Echocardiographic examinations were made in these 2 patients, as well as in the patient with cardiac arrhythmia (W16), but no cardiomyopathy was
detected.

Patients
with proximal muscle weakness usually displayed
pronounced histopathological changes including
atrophy, variation of fiber size, splitting of fibers,
increased internal nuclei counts, necrosis and fibrosis (Fig. 2A). One biopsy contained targetoid

were not judged to be neurogenic in origin. In
patients with distal leg muscle weakness, the biopsy was usually taken from femoral muscle. Histopathological findings were mild. An increased
number of fibers with internal nuclei was the
most frequent sign found in 6 of 8 biopsied patients in this group (Fig. 2B). Three patients displayed a marked variation in fiber size and fiber
splitting. Such myopathic findings as necrosis, hyalination, vacuolar degeneration, and increased
endomysial fibrosis were seen only occasionally. A

detailed report of the results will be published
separately. .
Summary of Findings in CT, MRI, and US. (Table 2.).

In patients with profound proximal muscle weakness, all 3 imaging methods showed consistent
findings of both wasted muscular structures and
fatty involvement as attributes of atrophy in all
muscle groups investigated (Table 2). The distal
leg muscles and paravertebral muscles had some
preserved structures (Fig. 3A and B). In the other

tients investigated were found to have fatty involvement and loss of structure in tibial anterior
muscles. Definitive focal changes of the same category were, furthermore, discovered in various
muscles often asymmetrically (Fig. 3C to 3E). Five
patients showed additional changes in calf muscles, and 4 patients had affected parts of femoral
muscles. Two patients had asymmetrical changes
in gluteal muscles, and 1 patient with known lumbar spondylolisthesis, displayed marked changes
in paravertebral lumbar muscles. All patients had
some additional muscle finding besides the involvement of tibial anterior muscles. A more detailed report on methods and results will be published separately.
(Fig. 1). The large family contains 23 known affected members in 13 different
sibships. Severe proximal muscular dystrophy appeared alone in 3 sibships, and the distal leg muscle weakness alone in 9 sibships. Both clinical phenotypes were represented in 1 sibship. In 4
instances of distal leg muscle weakness there were
affected persons in 2 consecutive generations. The
severe proximal muscular dystrophy was always
seen in 1 generation only.
Consanguinity was marked, although only 1 of
the 75 pairs of patients in the pedigree were first
cousins. Kinship of parents was proved in 20
pairs. Among parents of affected members, consanguinity was discovered in 1 1 of the 13 pairs.
The examination of asymptomatic family
members is in progress, and a report on clinical
genetics and further genealogical data will be published separately.
Pedigree Analysis.

DISCUSSION

Differential diagnosis of hereditary neuromuscular diseases is based on clinical, genetic, and histopathological findings. Histopathology does not
provide distinction among subgroups within muscular dystrophy. As the pedigree data is very complex in this large family, the clinical definition becomes even more important. The affected family
members can be divided into 2 separate groups
according to their clinical features.
Eight patients had proximal muscle weakness
starting in the first to third decade. The clinical
course was progressive causing loss of walking
ability usually in the third or fourth decade but, in
some cases, as late as the seventh decade. These
patients fit classical descriptions2' as well as later
and recent definitions of LGMD.3,20In 3 patients,

MD With Separate Phenotypes in a Family

the onset was so early that they could, perhaps, be
better placed under the heading of autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy of ~hildhood.~"
In the second group, the patients had a completely different clinical picture with distal leg
muscle weakness appearing in the fourth to the
seventh decade. The progression was slow and the
patients preserved their walking ability, even into
the ninth decade. Three of these patients had not
been aware of their disease, or at least had not
sought medical advice, which illustrates the mild
nature of the condition. Under clinical examination, anterior tibial muscles were usually the only
affected muscle group. Imaging methods revealed, however, unexpected patchy involvement
in various asymptomatic muscles beyond the anterior tibial muscles.
The patients in the second group fall into the
category of distal myopathies, but it is difficult to
give them a specific diagnosis. T o our knowledge,
studies of this particular type of myopathy have
not been published. Their muscle weakness was
confined to lower leg muscles, contrary to what is
found in Welander's disease2g and in other distal
myopathies in which hand muscles are also clearly
i n ~ o l v e d . ~Entities
*'~
like scapuloperoneal muscular dystrophy27 or autosomal dominant humeroperoneal myopathy' are, therefore, also excluded.
Weakness of anterior tibial muscles and decreased
dorsiflexion of ankles is a common finding in both
proximal and distal muscular dystrophies, 1,3,26,29
but in these entities, the clinical muscle involvement extends far beyond the anterior tibial muscles. Intrinsic foot muscles were not affected, as is
found in sporadic anterior compartment myopathy. 14,16 There were no findings that suggested

In the present family, severe proximal muscular
dystrophy occurred in 4 sibships, and both sexes
were represented among the patients. The parents were highly consanguineous, and none had
any symptoms of proximal muscle weakness.
These findings are compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance. Also, distal leg muscle weakness appeared in both sexes-but in successive

generations. This would suggest autosomal dominant inheritance for this particular form, and such
an explanation supports the existence of 2 separate muscle diseases in the same pedigree. The simultaneous occurrence of 2 such rare muscle disorders in the same family is, of course, unlikely,
and raises the possibility of other explanations.
The autosomal dominant form of LGMD has a
variable clinical picture, ranging from classical
proximal muscle weakness to predominantly distal
muscle involvement with slow progre~sion.~
This
could, perhaps, explain the different manifestations, although our own experiences of this entity
favor a mild muscle involvement associated with
joint c o n t r a ~ t u r e snot
~ ~ seen among these patients. In Welander’s series of hereditary distal
myopathy, there were some “grossly atypical

cases” with severe proximal muscle weakness
thought to re resent homozygously inherited
dominant gene.’ Most of the patients in her original d e ~ c r i p t i o nwere
~ ~ from an area in Sweden
that faces the Larsmo archipelago on the other
side of the Bothnic Gulf. However, the pattern of
inheritance in several sibships does not support
dominant inheritance. Finally there could be several allelic genes for autosomal recessive LGMD.
That would create possibilities for genetic compounds that might show variable clinical manifestations, as demonstrated with various forms of
hexosaminidase deficiency diseases.I2 The probability of such compounds would be greatly increased in highly consanguineous populations like
the family investigated in the present study.
