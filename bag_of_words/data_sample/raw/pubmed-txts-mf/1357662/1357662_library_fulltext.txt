(11). Moreover, there is evidence for a Tse-1-like factor on
human chromosome 17 (9).
The human TAT gene extends over 10.9 kilobases (kb)
containing 12 exons, and its 3.0-kb mRNA codes for a
454-amino acid protein of 50.4 kDa (12). We previously
described an RHS patient with an inherited and a de novo
deletion of the TAT locus at chromosome 16q22 (13). We now
report the molecular defects underlying the RHS phenotypes
in three nondeletion tyrosinemia type II patients.

Tyrosinemia type II (Richner-Hanhart synABSTRACT
drome, RHS) is a disease of autosomal recessive inheritance
characterized by keratitis, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, mental retardation, and elevated blood tyrosine levels. The disease
results from deficiency in hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase
(TAT; L-tyrosine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC
2.6.1.5), a 454-amino acid protein encoded by a gene with 12
exons. To identify the causative mutations in five TAT alleles
cloned from three RHS patients, chimeric genes constructed
from normal and mutant TAT alleles were tested in directing
TAT activity in a transient expression assay. DNA sequence
analysis of the regions identified as nonfunctional revealed six
different point mutations. Three RHS alleles have nonsense
mutations at codons 57, 223, and 417, respectively. One
"complex" RHS allele carries a GI
GG splice donor
mutation in intron 8 together with a Gly Val substitution at
amino acid 362. A new splice acceptor site in intron 2 ofthe fifth
RHS allele leads to a shift in reading frame.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients. RHS patients studied are TI from Japan (14), MT
from France (15), and MB from Italy. Age at onset of eye and
skin lesions was 3-4 years for MB, and about 10 and 15 years,
respectively, for her tyrosinemic brother. Untreated plasma
tyrosine levels were 1.21 mM for MB and 1.05 mM for her
brother, diagnosed at the age of 23 years and 27 years,
respectively. Psychomotor development was normal in both
sibs.
DNA Cloning and Sequence Analysis. To isolate 13-kb Spe
I fragments harboring the complete 10.9-kb human TAT gene
(12), 100 i&g of genomic DNA was digested with Spe I and
fractionated by electrophoresis in 0.7% agarose, and fragments of 11-15 kb were isolated and cloned into the Xba I site
of EMBL12 (16) by standard techniques (17). Positive recombinants were identified by plaque hybridization of the
resulting libraries (2.5 x 105 to 1.1 x 106 recombinants) with
TAT cDNA clone phcTAT2-16 (12). Complete inserts were
transferred as Sal I fragments into pSPSV, a derivative of
pSP65 with the 180-base-pair (bp) HindIII-Pvu II fragment
adjacent to the polylinker segment replaced by a 323-bp
HindIII-Pvu II fragment from pSV2cat (18) carrying the
simian virus 40 enhancer region. Subfragments cloned into
M13 were sequenced (19) using Sequenase (United States

Tyrosinemia type II, also known as Richner-Hanhart syndrome (RHS), is an inborn error of metabolism due to a block
in the transamination reaction converting tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, a step catalyzed by the hepatic cytosolic enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT; L-tyrosine:2oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.5). RHS patients
suffer from keratitis, palmar and plantar hyperkeratosis, and
sometimes mental retardation, accompanied by highly elevated serum and urine levels of tyrosine and its metabolites.
The condition improves rapidly on a tyrosine- and phenylalanine-restricted diet (for reviews see refs. 1 and 2).
TAT has been extensively studied in rat and mouse,
revealing a complex pattern of regulation. Enzyme activity is
virtually absent in fetal rat liver and becomes detectable just
after birth (3). The TAT gene is under hormonal control by
glucocorticoids and cAMP, which increase the basal transcription rate 5- to 10-fold (4, 5), acting via different response
elements in the 5' flanking region of the gene (6, 7). Furthermore, the rodent TAT genes are subject to two trans-acting
regulators. Basal expression and hormone inducibility of the
Tat gene on mouse chromosome 8 are controlled by a positive
trans-acting factor, alf, encoded on mouse chromosome 7 (8).
Conversely, the tissue-specific extinguisher locus Tse-J on
mouse chromosome 11 encodes a product that represses Tat
gene transcription in nonliver cells (9).
Little is known about the regulation of the human TAT
gene. As in rodents, hepatic TAT activity reaches significant
levels shortly after birth, although some activity is present in
the fetus (10). Induction of human TAT by glucocorticoids
and cAMP has been demonstrated in fetal liver organ cultures

Biochemical).

Construction of Chimeric TAT Genes. For constructs BII-1
and BII-2 (Fig. 1), 5.0-kb Bgl II fragments were removed from
each pSPSV clone to generate deletion clones (designated
pSPSVdB), purified by cloning into pUC vectors, and reinserted into the deletion clones in the appropriate combinations. Constructs X-1 and X-2 were obtained accordingly,
making use of an Xba I site in the polylinker. For constructs
H-1 and BII-1/H, the 5.0-kb Bgl II fragments of the normal
TAT allele and of allele RHS2B were cloned into a pUC
derivative lacking a HindIII site. These subclones were used
to exchange the 2.7-kb HindIII fragment in the manner
described, and the resulting chimeric Bgl II fragments were

FIG. 1. Functional transfection assays of chimeric TAT genes identify regions harboring inactivating mutations. Chimeric TAT genes were
constructed by combining fragments from mutant alleles (black segments) with those from the wild-type allele (open segments) in plasmid vector
pSP65 carrying the simian virus 40) enhancer. Plasmid constructs were cotransfected with RSVlacZ plasmid as internal standard into mouse Ltkfibroblasts. Enzyme activity of cell extracts prepared after transient expression for 45-53 hr is given as relative TAT activity (TAT specific
activity x 1000/f3-galactosidase specific activity). Exons A-L of the TAT gene (12) are indicated at the top, with coding sequences indicated
by black boxes, and 5' and 3' untranslated regions by white boxes. Vector segments are shaded, and the simian virus 40 enhancer fragment is
hatched. Relevant restriction sites: BI, Bgl I; BiI, Bgl II; H, HindIII; S, Sal I; X, Xba I. Regions containing inactivating mutations as defined
by relative TAT activities below 100 are indicated by M. Note that allele RHS2B carries two mutations, Ml and M2.

reinserted into the wild-type pSPSVdB clone. Generation of
constructs BI-1 and BI-2 was more complex (20).
Transient Transfection Assay. One day before transfection,
2 x 106 mouse Ltk- cells (thymidine kinase-deficient fibroblast line) were seeded in 10-cm dishes and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10%o
fetal bovine serum. Plasmid DNA [9 ug of test plasmid plus
1 ,ug of RSVlacZ plasmid (gift of W. Ankenbauer, German
Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg), a derivative of
pCH110 (36) containing the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal
repeat promoter/enhancer] was then added in 3 ml of transfection solution consisting ofDMEM, 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4),
0.1 mM chloroquine diphosphate, and 0.2 mg of DEAEdextran per ml. Transfection solution was removed after 5 hr,
and cells were incubated for 40-48 hr in normal medium.
Cells from one dish were harvested in 250 ,ul of TAT buffer
(21) and sonified, and extracts were cleared by centrifugation
at 10,000 x g. TAT assays (21) were performed with 60 M1 of
extract, after a preincubation step at 750C for 2 min to
inactivate nonspecific transaminases. The (3-galactosidase
assay (22) was carried out with 40 ul of extract.
Nuclease Si Mapping. A 600-bp genomic fragment of
RHS1A, extending from a HindIII site in intron 2 to an Ava
I site 75 bp into exon C, was cloned, after fill-in of the
restriction sites, into Sma I-cut M13mpl9, regenerating an
Ava I site close to the universal sequencing primer. Dideoxysequencing products obtained from this clone, designated
19HA3, were cut with Ava I, resulting in a sequence ladder
directly aligning with the nuclease Sl-resistant products. To
generate the nuclease S1 probe fragment, clone 19HA3 was
cut with Ava I, 5' end-labeled, and cut with Dde I, and a
135-bp Dde I-Ava I fragment labeled at the Ava I site in exon
C was isolated. This probe fragment (0.04 pmol) was mixed
in 10 ul of hybridization solution with total RNA isolated
from mouse Ltk- cells 21 hr after transfection with mutant

allele RHS1A (40 Mg of RNA) or normal TAT allele (20 Mg of
RNA) or from untransfected cells (20 Mg of RNA). Hybridization and nuclease S1 digestion were essentially as described (23), except that RNADNA hybrids were allowed to
form at 520C for 8 hr, then at 500C for 4 hr, and finally at 480C
for 4 hr.

RESULTS
Cloning and Differentiation of TAT Aflales. When this analysis was started, the DNA sequence of the exons and their
flanking intron borders in the human TAT gene had not yet
been determined (12), precluding a PCR-based approach. We
therefore cloned normal and mutant TAT alleles on 13-kb
restriction fragments containing the complete 10.9-kb TAT
gene into plasmid vectors. The normal TAT allele is derived
from clone AhTAT1 (12), whereas the mutant TAT alleles are
from three RHS patients (TI, MT, and MB). Eight independent
clones each were isolated from TI and MT, and six from MB.
Results of allele differentiation by restriction pattern analysis are presented in Table 1. Alleles RHS1A and RHS1B,
represented by five and three clones, respectively, differ only
in their Hph I pattern. Alleles RHS2A and RHS2B, also
represented by five and three clones, respectively, can be
differentiated by eight enzymes. No differences were found
among the six independent clones from patient MB. The
differences observed with BamHI and Hae III are true
restriction fragment length polymorphisms (24, 25) and have
allowed us to identify, by pedigree analysis, RHS2A as the
maternal allele and RHS2B as the paternal allele (24).
Functional Transfection Assay of Chimeric TAT Genes. To
narrow down the region(s) harboring the mutant site(s) in
each RHS allele, a series of chimeric TAT clones was
constructed by exchanging restriction fragments between
normal and mutant TAT alleles (Fig. 1). For every mutant

exchanges took place at the Bgl I site between exons C and D

exons K and L (for RHS2A and RHS2B). Finally, for RHS2B
only, a 2.7-kb HindIII fragment from the 3' end ofthe gene was
exchanged. Resulting plasmids were tested for directing TAT
activity in mouse Ltk- fibroblasts after cotransfection with
plasmid RSVlacZ, using B-galactosidase activity as internal
standard to compensate for variable transfection efficiencies.

Constructs giving relative TAT activities below 100 were
scored as carrying inactivating mutations, which could be
narrowed down to the regions marked by brackets (M) in Fig.
1. Interestingly, RHS2B carries two mutations, Ml and M2,
each being sufficient for complete inactivation.
Identification of the TAT Mutations by DNA Sequence
Analysis. All exons and exon/intron boundaries, as well as
the first 200 bp of the 5' flanking region, within the relevant
regions thus identified were subjected to DNA sequence
analysis on appropriate M13 subclones. The autoradiographs
in Fig. 2 display the mutations identified, which are summarized in Fig. 3.
Each mutation turned out to be a single base substitution,
except for the deletion of a CT dinucleotide at positions -8
and -7 in the promoter region of RHS3 (data not shown).
Three mutations generate stop codons in exons F, L, and B
of alleles RHS1B (Fig. 2B), RHS2A (Fig. 2C), and RHS3
(Fig. 2F), respectively. One mutation leads to an exchange
from Gly to Val in codon 362 within exon J of RHS2B (Fig.
2E; region M2 in Fig. 1). This mutation, a G-- T transversion,
occurs within the sequence CCT-G(G/T)A-CTC (codons
361-363), thus destroying restriction sites for BstNI
(CCTGG) and Hinfl (GACTC) and generating a new Rsa I
site (GTAC) (compare Table 1).
Finally, two mutations occur at splicejunctions. The second
inactivating mutation of RHS2B (Fig. 2D; region Ml in Fig. 1)
changes the conserved GI splice donor sequence at the exon
H/intron 8 boundary to GQj. The second splice mutation, an
A-- G transition in intron 2 of RHS1A (Fig. 2A), creates a new
splice acceptor site (see below). Due to the new splice occurring four nucleotides 5' to the normal splice position, a new
reading frame results, terminating at codon 91/92 in exon C.

FIG. 2. RHS alleles from patients TI, MT, and MB carry different point mutations. Autoradiographs are from 6% polyacrylamide sequencing
gels, with 35S-labeled sequencing products obtained from M13 subclones of mutant and normal TAT alleles run side by side. Relevant segments
shown are from intron 2/exon C (A), exon F (B), exon L (C), exon H/intron 8 (D), exon J (E), and exon B (F). The sequence read from the
autoradiographs is of RNA-like polarity except for B, where labeling of sequence lanes has been transposed. The slight shift in the sequencing
ladder of RHS2B in E is due to a deletion in the M13 polylinker that occurred during subcloning. Exon sequences are in uppercase, intron
sequences in lowercase. The reading frame is indicated by brackets, and nucleotides affected by mutations are boxed. The consequences of the
observed mutations are summarized in Fig. 3.

Nuclease Si Analysis of the RHS1A Splice Acceptor Mutation in Intron 2. A 135-bp Dde I-Ava I fragment, 5'-endlabeled in the coding strand of the TAT gene at an Ava I site
in exon C, was used as probe in nuclease S1 analysis.
Hybridization to total RNA from Ltk- cells transiently
transfected with the normal or RHS1A mutant TAT allele
yields protected DNA fragments of larger size under less
stringent nuclease S1 conditions (Fig. 4, lanes 1, 2, 4, and 5),
while more stringent conditions lead to prominent fragments
of the expected size for the mutant (lane 3) and normal (lane
6) TAT allele that are exactly four nucleotides apart. (Note
that because the G ribonucleotide residue at the 3' end of
exon B can base pair with the C deoxyribonucleotide residue
at the 3' end of intron 2 of both the normal and mutant TAT
allele, the S1 analysis can at best identify the nucleotide
preceding the start of the normal and mutant exon C, as
indicated at left in Fig. 4.) Because virtually no wild-type
signal appears in Fig. 4, lane 3, the mutant splice acceptor site
of RHS1A is used preferentially, if not exclusively.

DISCUSSION
We have identified six point mutations in five mutant TAT
alleles cloned from three RHS patients from three countries.

FIG. 3. Summary of point mutations
and of their consequences in the five RHS
alleles analyzed. The positions of the six
point mutations identified (Fig. 2) are given
with respect to the exon/intron map of the
TAT gene. Exon sequences are in uppercase, intron sequences in lowercase. Relevant codons are numbered, and mutant
nucleotides are marked by an asterisk. The
RHS1A mutation generates a novel splice
acceptor site that is efficiently used (Fig.
4). Ter, termination.

All mutations are different, scattered over the whole 12-exon
human TATgene. Two stop codon mutations, in exons B and
L, result from C -- T transitions in CGA (Arg) codons (Fig.
2 C and Fand Fig. 3), the CG dinucleotide being a well-known
mutational hotspot (26). In accordance with the absence of
TAT activity in liver biopsy samples of patients TI and MT
(14, 15), their RHS alleles carry strong inactivating mutations: a splice mutation in one allele (RHS1A for TI, RHS2B
for MT) and a nonsense mutation in the second allele (RHS1B
for TI, RHS2A for MT) (Figs. 2 and 3).
We have demonstrated experimentally for allele RHS1A
that the new splice acceptor site in intron 2 is used in high
preference over the wild-type splice site (Fig. 4), resulting in
a shift of reading frame and premature termination of translation at codons 91/92 in the mutant TAT mRNA. For allele
RHS2B, the molecular consequences of the GI-+ Gi splice
donor mutation in intron 8 have not been investigated.
Identical GI -- GGi splice donor mutations in the (3-globin
gene and in the factor IX gene lead to 3O-thalassemia (27) and
to severe hemophilia B (28), respectively. It is therefore
highly likely that the RHS2B splice mutation is a similarly
strong loss-of-function mutation.
The nonsense mutation in allele RHS3 of patient MB, at
codon 57 in exon B, is also a completely inactivating mutation

of allele RHS1A is efficiently used. Lanes G, A,
T, and C show the dideoxy sequencing ladder
obtained from a 600-bp HindIII-Ava I fragment of
RHS1A, starting at an Ava I site in exon C and
extending into intron 2. Nuclease S1-resistant
products obtained by digesting hybrids between a
135-bp Dde I-Ava I fragment, 5'-end-labeled at
the Ava I site in exon C, and total RNA isolated
from mouse Ltk- cells transiently transfected
with mutant allele RHS1A (lanes 1-3), normal
TAT allele (lanes 4-6), or untransfected (lane 7),
are shown. Lanes 1, 4, and 7, 200 units of nuclease
S1 per ml, 1 hr, 250C; lanes 2 and 5, 1000 units of
nuclease S1 per ml, 1 hr, 25C; lanes 3 and 6, 1000
units of nuclease S1 per ml, 30 min, 37C; lane 8,
untreated 135-bp Dde I-Ava I fragment. Most
prominent nuclease S1-resistant fragments of mutant and normal TAT alleles are marked by the
small and large arrowheads in lanes 3 and 6,
respectively. The corresponding positions in the
sequences shown at left are marked accordingly.
The reading frame in the mRNA sequence is
indicated by brackets; the nucleotide affected by
the mutation is boxed.

(Figs. 2F and 3). The second mutation observed in this allele,
the deletion of a CT dinucleotide at positions -8 and -7 in
the TAT promoter region (data not shown), which changes
the distance between the TATA box and the start site of
transcription from 27 to 25 bp, probably has no severe
consequences. The corresponding distance within the herpes
simplex thymidine kinase promoter region could be changed
over a much wider range, for example, before a reduction in
transcription rate was observed (29).
It is possible that patient MB is homozygous for the RHS3
allele. First, all six independent clones analyzed gave the
same restriction patterns (Table 1), and all six had the same
CT dinucleotide deletion in the TAT promoter region (data
not shown). Second, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for TAT and the flanking loci haptoglobin and
chymotrypsinogen B on chromosome 16q (30), for which the
parents are informative, shows that MB and her tyrosinemic
brother are both homozygous at all three loci (unpublished
data). Although consanguinity is not reported in this family,
the parents could be related, both coming from a small village
of about 1500 inhabitants in Lombardy.
A surprising observation is the presence of two inactivating
mutations in allele RHS2B (Fig. 2 D and E and Fig. 3). While
the nature of the intron 8 splice donor mutation clearly
indicates a severe functional defect as discussed, the Gly -3
Val exchange at residue 362 encoded in exon J seems less
dramatic. However, the functional test provided by the transfection assay demonstrates that the region designated M2 in
Fig. 1 between the HindIII andXba I sites flanking exons J and
K, respectively, indeed carries a strong loss-of-function mutation. While the existence of a new splice signal in the 1.1-kb
intron between exons J and K has not been ruled out, the
substitution at position 362 of valine for glycine, a residue
conserved in rat TAT (12), is not a trivial polymorphism, as
demonstrated by absence of the Rsa I site diagnostic for this
substitution in PCR fragments from the exon J region of 50
unrelated individuals (data not shown). Presence of the more
bulky side chain of valine in place of the hydrogen atom
contributed by glycine could possibly interfere with proper
folding or dimerization of the TAT protein, whose enzymatically active form is a homodimer (31). For example, a Gly -+
Val exchange at a site of close contact between a-helices B and
E in ,B-globin of hemoglobin Savannah leads to destabilization
and complete inactivation of the protein (32). Alleles like
RHS3 containing more than one mutation, designated "complex" alleles, although rare, have been observed in other
autosomal recessive disorders (33, 34).
The RHS2A nonsense mutation at codon 417 indicates that
the carboxyl-terminal 38 amino acid residues are essential for
TAT enzyme function (Figs. 2C and 3). This contrasts with
the amino terminus, where the first 64 amino acid residues
can be removed from rat TAT without any loss of enzyme
activity (35). Correspondingly, the amino-terminal 64 residues in the human and rat TAT protein differ at 18 positions,
whereas the carboxyl-terminal 38 residues are identical (12).
Analysis of further cases of RHS, in addition to providing
insight into the molecular heterogeneity of tyrosinemia type
II, may identify other residues critical for TAT enzyme
activity.
