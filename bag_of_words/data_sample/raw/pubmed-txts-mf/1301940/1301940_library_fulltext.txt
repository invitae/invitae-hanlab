To investigate the molecular basis of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in France, we applied the
single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method to the promoter region and the 18 exons of
the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. Seven probands, 4 heterozygotes, 2 compound
heterozygotes, and 1 homozygote, belonging to FH families were tested. In all cases, previous genetic
analysis and/or LDL receptor fibroblast assay had shown that the disease was due to defects in the
LDLR gene. O u t of the nine mutations expected, one nonsense mutation in exon 2 and six missense
mutations were identified in exons 3, 6,8, 11, and 15. Two of the latter were found in exon 6. In each
family, cosegregation of the base substitution and the disease was observed. Ninety-five control subjects were screened for the presence of the six missense mutations. None was detected, implying that
the mutations identified are deleterious. Our results indicate that the SSCP analysis of amplified
genomic D N A fragments can be successfully used to rapidly screen mutation containing exons in large
genes. Furthermore, all these mutations are newly described and demonstrate heterogeneity of LDLR
gene mutations responsible for FH in the French population, as in other reported Caucasian

INTRODUCTION
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common autosomal dominant disorder that affects
about one in 500 persons. FH is clinically characterized by an elevated plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration, tendon xanthomas, and
an increased risk of coronary arterial disease (Goldstein and Brown, 1989).
More than 50 different mutations in the gene
encoding the LDL receptor have now been reported at the molecular level in individuals with
FH (for review see Hobbs et al., 1990; Benlian and
Loux, 1991). These mutations, preventing normal
clearance of plasma LDL (Goldstein and Brown,
1989), are spanned throughout the 45 kilobases
(kb) of the LDL receptor gene (LDLR) located o n
chromosome 1 9 ~ 1 3(Sudhof et al., 1985). Twothirds of these mutations are gross gene rearrange0 1992 WILEY-LISS,INC.

ments easily detected by Southern blot analysis.
Since detection of point mutations is more difficult
and relies on systematic sequencing, their number
is probably underestimated with only 16 described
to date. To avoid sequencing of each of the 18
exons of the LDL receptor gene, it was necessary to
develop methods to screen rapidly for unknown
mutations in FH patients. These methods should
enable localization of the gene defect, restricting
sequencing to the targetted exons. A variety of
methods have now been proposed (for review see
Rossiter and Caskey, 1990), among them, the
RNase A cleavage method (Myers et al., 1985)
which failed to detect about one third of possible
single base substitutions, chemical cleavage (CotReceived May 12, 1992; accepted July 16, 1992.

ton et al., 1988) or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (Sheffield et al., 1989) which seem to
be more efficient methods but are not always simple and easy to use. Single strand conformation
polymorphism (SSCP) (Orita et al., 1989) represents an efficient and technically simple method,
but is limited to the study of 200 base pair (bp)
fragments. With its short exons, the LDL receptor
gene was thus particularly suited to the SSCP analysis. The technique involves the electrophoretic
separation of single strands of DNA on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Under these conditions, electrophoretic mobility of a single strand
DNA depends on its conformation, which is directly related to its nucleotide sequence. Therefore, any change in the sequence should theoretically generate a variant electrophoretic pattern.
In the present report we studied a sample of
French FH patients, from which previous genetic
data and fibroblast LDL receptor assay had linked
the disease to the LDL receptor gene. Furthermore, no major gene arrangement had been found.
For identification of point mutations lying anywhere within the coding region of the probands,
we have used the SSCP method to systematically
screen the promoter region and the 18 exons of the
LDL receptor gene.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients

Patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, tendon xanthomas in some cases, and a family history
of high cholesterol levels and heart disease, were
selected. A total of seven probands and members
of their family, belonging to independent kindreds
numbered 1 to 7, were studied. The diagnosis of

FH was based o n plasma cholesterol and LDL values in the patients. The four probands belonging to
family 2, 4, 5, and 7 were clinically considered as
heterozygotes with plasma cholesterol levels over
300 mg/dl, while the three probands belonging to
family 1, 3, and 6 were clinically considered as
homozygotes and had plasma cholesterol levels
over 600 mg/dl before the age of ten with tendon
and cutaneous xanthomas. In these subjects, analysis of the LDLR gene haplotypes revealed that two
probands, belonging to family 3 and 6, were in fact
compound heterozygotes and had inherited a different mutant LDL receptor allele from each parent. The remaining proband, from family 1, was
genetically homozygote with a family history of
consanguinity. In all cases, previous genetic data
or fibroblast LDL receptor assay had associated the
disease to the LDLR gene.
PCR-SSCP Analysis

The PCR-amplified products of the promoter
region and the 18 exons in the LDLR gene were
studied with the SSCP method (Orita et al.,
1989). T h e sequences of the primers that were specifically designed with the Oligotest program
(Beroud et al., 1990) for this study are listed in
Table 1. The other primers used were those described by Leitersdorf and co-workers (1990). PCR
reactions were performed in a volume of 50 pl,
using 0.5 p g genomic DNA, 200 pmol dNTPs,

primers was added to the reaction mixture. Amplification conditions were 30 cycles of 1 min denaturation at 94"C, 1 min annealing at 55"C, 1
min 30 sec elongation at 73"C, except for exons 6,
9, 10, and 11 where annealing was at 62"C, and
exons 12, 15, and 16 where annealing was at 56,
50, and 65"C, respectively. T h e labelled PCR fragments were diluted 1/10 in a solution of 0.1%
SDS, 10 mM EDTA. An aliquot of 2 pl was mixed
with 2 p1 of 95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA,
0.05% bromophenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol, heated at 95°C for 2 min, and put on ice.
Samples of 4 pl were then loaded onto a 5 or 6%
nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with or without
10% glycerol. Electrophoresis was performed at
room temperature at 5 W for 16 hr for glycerol
containing gels, and at 6 W for 7 hr for gels without glycerol. The gel was dried onto 3 MM paper
and was autoradiographed at -80°C for 20 hr.
DNA Sequencing
Exons displaying variant patterns were sequenced using the asymmetric PCR method (Attree et al., 1989). Following the first PCR reaction, a second amplification was carried out with
an unequal ratio of primers (50:2) for 50 cycles,
under conditions similar to those of the first PCR
described above. To increase the specificity of the
amplification, the first 10 cycles were performed
with an increased annealing temperature corresponding to the T, of the primer in excess. Singlestrand PCR products were first purified and concentrated on a Centricon- 100 microconcentrator
(AMICON) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and subsequently sequenced by the
Sanger dideoxy method (Sanger e t al., 1977) (Se-

quenase kit; version 2.0, USB) using 10 pmol of
the appropriate primer.
Allele-Specific Oligonucleotide Hybridization
Ninety-five control subjects were screened for
the presence of the six missense mutations detected by SSCP in exons 3, 6 (two mutations), 8,
11, and 15, employing PCR-amplification followed by AS0 hybridization. After NaOH denaturation, 3/50 vol of the PCR reaction was dotted
onto a charge-modified nylon membrane (Gelman
Science). AS0 hybridization was performed under
standard conditions (Saiki et al., 1986). The sequence of the primers used as probes specific for
either the normal or the mutant sequence, and the
appropriate washing conditions are described in
Table 2.

RESULTS
The involvement of the LDL receptor gene was
ascertained by haplotyping, or by assay of the receptor activity on fibroblasts, or by both. Haplotyping of the LDLR gene was performed by Southern blot experiments, in all probands, with an
average of 6 RFLPs. Segregation of LDLR haplotypes with the disease was observed in families 1,
2, 4, 5, and 6 (data not shown). Haplotyping was
also performed for the apo B gene, excluding its
implication in families 1, 2, 4, and 5. In the remaining families, the mutation at codon 3,500 in
the apo B gene was not found (data not shown).
Furthermore, by fibroblast assays less than 5% of
the normal amount of LDL receptor activity was
found in probands of family 1, 2, and 6. In proband
of family 7, 50% of the normal amount of LDL
receptor activity was measured (data not shown).

codon to a Stop codon.

In this study, the promoter region and the 18
exons of the LDLR gene were separately PCR amplified with primers which flank each exon sequence. Consecutively, each PCR product was analyzed with the SSCP method. Using this
approach, we screened 7 unrelated FH patients for
unknown LDLR mutations, and we identified abnormal electrophoretic patterns in six different exons, for six subjects. In the remaining patient, the
migration patterns in all the exons tested were similar to those observed for controls. Optimal results
were obtained with both glycerol containing gels
and gels without glycerol, when electrophoresis
was performed at room temperature. Sequence
analysis of exons revealing variant patterns identified 7 base substitutions as yet unreported.
The proband of family 1 has a C -+ T substitution of 12Gln (CAG), which creates a stop codon
(TAG) in exon 2 and would cause a premature
termination in LDL receptor synthesis. As shown
in Figure 1, the proband was found to be homozygous for the nonsense mutation, and his parents
were heterozygous for this mutation as expected
from the family history of consanguinity.
The proband and two affected members of family 2, father and paternal uncle, were found to be
heterozygous for a G + A transition that changes
80G1u (GAG) to Lys (AAG) in exon 3 (data not

The proband belonging to family 3 was found to
be heterozygous for a A -+ G transition that substitutes 290Lys (AAA) to Arg (AGA) in exon 6.
This patient is a compound heterozygote and had
inherited two different mutations from his parents.

father. The mutation o n the maternal side was
discovered by sequence analysis. Surprisingly, sequencing of exon 6 revealed the presence of a second nucleotide change, that did not alter the electrophoretic mobility by the SSCP method, since
the mother showed a migration pattern similar to
that of the control (Fig. 2). It constitutes a G + T
transition that replaces 283Asp (GAC) by Tyr
(TAC). By sequence analysis, this mutation was
found at the heterozygous level in the proband as
well as in affected members from the maternal side
of the family, mother and aunt.
The proband of family 4 was found to be heterozygous for a G -+ A change that substitutes
347Cys(TGC) to Tyr (TAC) in exon 8. The abnormal SSCP pattern was present in the affected
father and not in the healthy mother (data not

(data not shown). The 7 base substitutions identified in this study are listed in Table 3 , their localisation with respect to the LDLR gene and protein are shown in figure 5.
In some cases, variant electrophoretic patterns
were found both in controls and FH individuab.
Sequence analysis identified single base substitutions that did not change amino acids, implying
they were polymorphisms. Two polymorphisms detected respectively in exons 2 and 18 were recently
reported (Soutar, 1991; Cavanaugh and Esteal,
1991). The new polymorphisms observed in exons
10, 11, and 15 are described elsewhere (Saint-Jore
et al., submitted).

DlSCUSSION
In order to identify FH mutations in a French
population, we have performed the SSCP technique to screen the promoter region and the 18
exons of the LDLR gene in probands, restricting
sequencing to the exons revealing variant patterns.
All patients whose migration profile was abnormal
were found to carry a nucleotide change in the
corresponding exon. However, in one patient the
SSCP method failed to detect a mutation which
was identified solely by sequencing: the 2 8 3 A ~+
p
Tyr substitution carried by proband 3 and his
mother did not alter the electrophoretic pattern of
exon 6. However the 290Lys+ Arg substitution
carried by proband 3 and his father altered the
electrophoretic mobility of exon 6 (Fig. 2). This
clearly shows that some nucleotide changes do not
alter the electrophoretic mobility of amplified exons. In principle, after SSCP analysis, in a subject
heterozygous for a mutation, the nucleotide substitution should generate two supplementary bands
corresponding to the mutated DNA strand and its

complementary mutated strand. Actually, in the
majority of the heterozygotes, we observed only
one additional band. On the other hand, in some
cases SSCP analysis can discriminate one change
from another simultaneously present in the same
amplified exon product. For example, substitutions
found in exon 15, one mutation and one polymorphism, generate distinctly different migration profiles when analyzed by SSCP (Fig. 4). Thus, the
ability of a single base substitution to alter the
conformation of the DNA single strand is unpredictable and represents a drawback of this method.
In our study, six mutations out of the nine expected gave abnormal migration patterns after
SSCP analysis. Therefore, one-third of the possible mutations were undetected by SSCP analysis.
This failure to detect an abnormal pattern was only
confirmed in one case, the 2 8 3 A ~+p Tyr mutation
in exon 6. For the two other expected mutations,
since only the exons and the promoter of the
LDLR gene were investigated, it can also be proposed that the two remaining undetected mutations lie elsewhere within the gene. Although numerous methods have been designed to detect
single base substitutions in PCR products, none of
them is both technically simple and powerful
enough to detect 100% of the possible mutations.
Thus, coupling of these scanning methods should
increase the probability of detecting mutations.
Two methods have been reported recently that are
technically simple to use. O n e is derived from
SSCP, the rSSCP method which uses RNA instead of DNA (Danenberg et al., 1992; Sarkar et
al., 1992). The other, the heteroduplex method,
can complement the SSCP analysis because its
principle does not rely on secondary structure formation (White et al., 1992).
In this study, we identified one nonsense mutation and six missense mutations. The nonsense
mutation identified in codon 12 gives rise to a
premature stop codon which eliminates almost all
of the LDL receptor domains. This strongly suggests that the "Gln +- Stop change leads to a
variant which fails to produce any LDL receptor
protein. For the six missense mutations detected,
the fact that we have not found these nucleotide
changes in 95 control individuals, together with
the segregation of these mutations with the FH
phenotype in affected families, supports the hypothesis that these novel mutations are the cause
of the disease. Furthermore, these variations affect
amino acids that lie in domains important for maturation and function of the LDL receptor protein
(Fig. 5).

Three missense mutations, the "Glu
Lys,
2 8 3 A ~ p Tyr, and 290Lys+ Arg substitutions,
have been found in the ligand binding domain of
the LDL receptor, which is composed of seven cysteine-rich repeats. Each repeat contains clustered
negative charges that are involved in the binding
of positively charged residues o n apo BlOO and apo
E. The 8oG1u + Lys and 2 8 3 A ~+
p Tyr substitutions concerned amino acids that are highly conserved among animal species and among repeat sequences (Esser et al., 1988), and are involved in
the clustering of negative charges. These mutations result in a change of a basic for an acidic
amino acid in the second and the seventh repeat,
respectively. Although these substitutions are expected to affect the binding of the LDL receptor to
its ligand, previous studies have demonstrated that
amino acid substitutions in conserved domains of
cysteine-rich repeats alter the transport of the LDL
receptor protein from the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) to the Golgi complex (Leitersdorf et al.,
1988, 1990). These mutations seem to interfere
with the normal folding of the protein and prevent
the transport of the unproperly folded protein out
of the ER. The same substitution of a lysine for a
glutamic acid residue identified in the highly conserve negatively charged amino acids near the
COOH terminus of the second repeat was previously observed in the same sequence but in the
fifth repeat (Leitersdorf et al., 1990). The resulting
protein was not transported normally out of the

ER. Since the nature and the number of amino
acids located between cysteines are important for
the proper folding of the protein, it can be proposed that the 290Lys + Arg substitution found
near the last cysteine of the seventh repeat, interferes with the normal folding of the LDL receptor
protein. Indeed steric hindrance of arginine is
greater than that of lysine.
The missense mutation found in codon 347 is
located in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) like
domain, which contains 3 cysteine-rich repeats
(A, B, and C). Each repeat contains 6 cysteines
that are normally involved in the formation of disulfide bonds. The mutation located in repeat B
substitutes a tyrosine for a cysteine, giving rise to
an unpaired cysteine. Another missense mutation,
previously reported, results in the same substitution of a tyrosine for a cysteine but in repeat C
(Leitersdorf et al., 1990). The effect of this mutation is to block the transport of the protein to the
cell surface. Similarly, it can be proposed that the
loss of a cysteine may alter the proper folding of the
LDL receptor protein, and thus prevent the transport of the protein out of the ER. The other mutation found in the EGF like domain that causes a
substitution of a valine for a glycine at residue 528
does not reside in a cystein-rich region. However,
the resulting LDL receptor protein may not be
transported to the cell surface as an identical substitution of a valine for a glycine previously reported at residue 544 (Esser and Russel, 1988).

332

LOUX ET AL.

These authors demonstrated that this substitution
gave rise to a protein that is not transported out of
the RE, and rapidly degraded.
The last missense mutation was identified in
exon 15, which encodes the 0-linked sugar domain. This mutation results in the change of an
isoleucine for a threonine which is involved in the
attachment of 0-linked carbohydrate chains. The
function of these 0-linked sugars remains unknown. Divergent results have been reported concerning this domain. Davis and colleagues (1987)
reported the construction of a cDNA with an exon
15 deletion which had no effect on receptor function in transfected fibroblasts, whereas Kaj inami
and co-workers (1988) described an exon 15 deletion found in an FH patient. The mutation reported in the present study is the first point mutation identified in this domain.
In conclusion, the work reported here demonstrates the usefullness of the SSCP method, applied to the detection of point mutations in the
LDLR gene. Furthermore, the wide distribution
throughout the gene and the heterogeneity of the
base substitutions identified in this French population are in agreement with previous results reported in other Caucasian populations (Benlian
and Loux, 1991; Russel et al., 1989).
