T h e genetic defects responsible for most phenylketonuria (PKU) and hyperphenylalaninemia ( H P A )
cases are located in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. Approximately 50-60 mutations have
been reported in Caucasians and are reflected in a wide range of clinical severities. Most mutations are
linked to specific haplotypes, as defined by eight polymorphic restriction sites in the P A H gene. We
hypothesized that there is at least one mild mutation linked to haplotype 12 in the Swedish P K U M P A
population, since 7 of 8 patients carrying haplotype 1 2 had mild HPA. Sequence analysis revealed a
C-to-G transversion at the second base of codon 322, resulting in a substitution of glycine for alanine,
in four mutant haplotype 1 2 genes, and a G-to-A transition at the second base of codon 408, resulting
in a substitution of glutamine for arginine, in another three mutant haplotype 12 genes. These mutations segregated with mutant haplotype 12 alleles in nuclear families but were not present on normal
or other mutant alleles. Both mutations were tested in a eukaryotic expression system in which enzyme
activities of different mutant P A H enzymes reflect the relative severities of the mutations, although
these in vitro activities cannot be translated directly into in vivo hepatic activities. T h e A322G mutant
P A H had about 75% and the R408Q mutant P A H about 55% of the wild-type P A H enzyme activity.
These in vitro activities are the highest reported for mutant P A H enzymes produced in the same
expression system. The A322G and R408Q mutations should therefore be the mildest P A H mutations
yet identified and expressed, a conclusion supported by the finding of these mutations in only very

INTRODCUTION

A vast majority of phenylketonuria (PKU) is
caused by an inherited (autosomal recessive) deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH; phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase, EC 1.14.16.I ). Severely affected individuals have high levels of
blood phenylalanine and will be mentally retarded
if left untreated (see Scriver et al., 1988 for
review).
In most Western countries, newborns with elevated blood phenylalanine are detected through a
neonatal screening program. In Sweden, roughly
65% of these have PKU that necessitates dietary
treatment through childhood and adolescence and
0 1992 WILEY-LISS. INC.

about 35% have milder PKU, often called hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), that does not require
any dietary regime at all or only during early childhood.
A number of mutations, mostly single-base substitutions, have been found in the PAH gene. In
vitro expression analysis in mammalian cells have
shown that they reduce PAH enzyme activity to a
variable extent (DiLella et al., 1987; Marvit ec al.,
1987; Lichter-Konecki et al., 1988; Okano e t al.,

1990; Caillaud et al., 1991; Dworniczak et al.,
1991; Okano et al., 1991a,b,c; Svensson et al.,
1992; Wang et al., 1991). Most patients are compound heterozygotes and their clinical state is determined by the combined effect of two mutant
PAH genes (Avigad et al., 1991; Okano et al.,
1991b; Svensson et al., 1992).
Within an ethnically homogeneous population,
a particular mutation is often associated to a certain haplotype. In current nomenclature, each
PAH haplotype is defined by a unique combination of eight restriction fragment polymorphisms
(RFLP) at the PAH locus (Woo, 1989). Haplotype
12 is relatively common on PKU chromosomes in
Sweden and Norway as compared to other European countries (Apold et al., 1990; Svensson et
al., 1991). Eighteen percent (9 alleles) of uncharacterized PKU alleles in Swedish PKU patients are
of haplotype 12 and 8 of these 9 mutant haplotype
12 alleles are found in mildly affected HPA patients (Svensson et al., 1991). We speculated that
these haplotype 12 chromosomes should carry mild
mutations. In the present study we describe the
identification and expression analysis of two mutations found in 3 and 4 of these haplotype 12
PAH genes, respectively.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Families and Phenotypic Classification
of Patients

We studied 88 families, including 93 of the 105
children with persistent hyperphenylalaninemia
detected through the Swedish neonatal screening
program 1966-1986 (Svensson et al., 1991). Patients with mutant PAH alleles of haplotype 12
were selected for sequence analysis. Information
about serum phenylalanine levels and dietary phenylalanine intake was obtained by one of the authors, who was ignorant of the genotypes of the
patients, either directly through files or via the
pediatricians and nutritionists in charge of the patients.
Identification of Mutations

PAH exons were amplified from genomic DNA
through the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with
primers 9A (5’YATGGCCAAGTACTAGGTTG-3‘ ) and 9B (5’-AGTTTCAAAGACCTGAGGGC-3 ’) for exon 9 and primers 12A (5’-ATGCCACTGAGAACTCTCTT-3’) and 12B (5’AGTCTTCGATTACTGAGAAA-3 ’) for exon
12. Single-strand templates were prepared as described by Spiegelberg et al. (1989) with ratios of
primer 9A to 9B and 12B to 12A of 50 to 1. Se-

quence analysis was performed with a kit from
Pharmacia according to the manufacturer’s instructions except that annealing was done at 65°C for
15 min followed by room temperature for 15 min
and that the labeling mix was diluted 1:20 instead
of 1:5. Sequencing primers were 5’-AGACTATAGCACTCCACC-3’ for exon 9 and 12A for
exon 12.
Population Screening

Once a mutation had been identified, its exclusive occurrence on PKU alleles and its linkage to
haplotype 12 was tested by screening for the presence of the mutation on normal and other mutant
alleles. For the A322G mutation, DNA containing exon 9 amplified from genomic DNA of patients and parents was blotted onto duplicate nylon
membranes using a slot-blotting device (Schleicher and Schuell). The membranes were hybridized with [ T - ~ ~ P ] A end-labeled
TP
oligonucleotides
for either the mutant (5’-GTAAATTGTGCCGAGCTTTTC-3’) or the normal (5’-GAAAAGCTCGCCACAATTTAC-3’) sequence and
washed under stringent conditons (DiLella and
Woo, 1987).
The screening for the R408Q mutation could be
simplified, since this mutation abolishes an Hue111
site. HaeIIl digestion of DNA containing exon 12
amplified from chromosomes bearing this mutation
results in one larger fragment instead of two
smaller fragments. Exon 12 was PCR amplified
from patient and parental samples. Twenty microliters of the 100-pl amplification reaction was digested with HaeIII and the resulting fragments
were separated on a 4% NuSieve gel. The expected
fragments were 27, 103, and 115 bp or, in the
presence of the R408Q mutation, 27 and 218 bp
(Eiken et al., 1991).
Expression Analysis

The entire human PAH cDNA (Kwok et al.,
1985) was inserted into the polylinker site of the
human expression vector pRc/CMV (InVitrogen) .
In this vector, a CMV promoter drives the
inserted gene and an early SV40 promoter drives a
neomycin resistance (NEO) gene. We used a
Muta-GeneR Phagemid Mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad)
to introduce the single-base substitutions into the
PAH sequence. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were
5’-GTAAATTGTGCCGAGCTTC-3’
for
A322G, 5’-AGAAGGGCTGAGGTATT-3‘ for
R408Q, and 5 ’-GAGAAGGGCCAAGGTATTGTG-3’ for R408W.

plates were transfected via electroporation (Promega) with 100 p g wild-type or mutated pRc/
CMV/PAH constructs or, as a negative control,
pRc/CMV. Twenty-five micrograms of pRc/CMV
containing a P-galactosidase cDNA and 375 p g
yeast tRNA were cotransfected with normal and
mutant constructs. After 48-72 hr of culture, the
cells were harvested and homogenized at 4°C with
a glass/teflon homogenizer for 5 cycles of 4 sec
each.
PAH enzyme activity was assayed as the conversion of [14C]phenylalanine to [14C]tyrosine
(Ledley et al., 1985b, 1987). For each PAH construct, 100-cl.1mixtures containing 0, 20, 50, 100,
200, and heat-denatured 200 pg cellular protein
were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C in 0.05 M Tris
buffer (pH 7.4) with 1 pCi [14C]phenylalanine
(485.7 mCi/mmol), 1 mM phenylalanine, 0.2 mM
tetrahydrobiopterin, 10 units of catalase, and 2
mM dithiotreitol. The reaction was stopped by incubation at 100°C for 5 min followed by chilling.
Five microliters of each sample was chromatographed o n a Silica Gel 60 TLC plates (EM Industries, Inc. ) and spots corresponding to phenylalanine and tyrosine were cut out and their activity
quantitated by scintillation counting (Ledley et
al., 1987). Western blotting and Northern blotting were performed essentially according to Ledley
et al. (198513, 1987). PAH mRNA was quantitated
by slot-blotting six dilutions of 0.375-12.0 pg total RNA onto duplicate nitrocellulose membranes

that were hybridized with the PAH and NEO
cDNAs. Pieces of membrane corresponding to the
slots were cut out and radioactivity was measured
by scintillation counting.
RESULTS
Identification of Two Novel Mutations in Exons
9 and 12

Sequence analysis of exon 9 showed a C-to-G
transversion at the second base of codon 322, resulting in a substitution of glycine for alanine (Fig.
l a ) . Sequencing of exon 12 revealed a G-to-A
transition at the second base of codon 408, resulting in a substitution of glutamine for arginine (Fig.
lb). Four of the 9 mutant haplotype 12 alleles in
this analysis were found to carry the A322G mutation and another three the R40SQ mutation.
Mendelian Segregation of the Mutant Alleles and
Association With HPA Chromosomes

According to sequence analysis of parental samples from all affected families, both mutations segregated with mutant haplotype 12 alleles. Figure 2
illustrates the inheritance of a paternal A322G
mutation and a maternal R408Q mutation in the
same family.
ASO-screening for the A322G mutation comprised 177 PKU and 157 normal alleles from the
sample population, including parental samples in
which the presence of the A322G mutation had
been verified by sequencing. Only these samples

samples hybridized to the normal oligonucleotide
(data not shown).
We analyzed the same set of samples for the
presence of the R408Q mutation. Digestion of
PCR amplified exon 12 with HaeIII resulted in the
expected fragments of 27, 103, and 115 bp in all
samples (data not shown). An additional fragment
of 281 bp was present only in three samples that,
according to sequence analysis, should have the
R408Q mutation. This fragment represents the
loss of an HaeIII site covering the last two bases of
codon 408.
Expression Analysis of the Mutant Alleles

We analyzed homogenates of COS cells transiently expressing a wild-type PAH cDNA or a
PAH cDN,4 with a single-base substitution corresponding to the A322G, R408Q or R408W mutation, created by site-directed mutagenesis. The
previously reported severe R408W mutation was
included for comparison, because it involves the
same codon as R408Q (DiLella et al., 1987).
RNA analysis revealed similar levels of PAH
mRNA from all the three mutant and the wildtype PAH cDNAs (Table 1) and the same length
of PAH mRNA from all of these constructs (data
not shown).
Enzyme activity, estimated as conversion of
phenylalanine to tyrosine, was linear in the range
of 0-200 p g cellular protein as illustrated by a
typical experiment in Figure 3A. The relative enzyme activity of each mutant PAH was expressed
as percentage of wild-type PAH activity and the
mean value was determined from four independent
transfection experiments (Table 1). The ratio between A322G PAH activity and R408Q activity

was between 1.2 and 1.6 in all 4 experiments.
Immunoreactivity was similarly quantitated from
Western blots, which consistently showed one protein band of equal size for each mutant and the
wild-type PAH (Fig. 3B). There was no detectable
PAH enzyme or immunoreactivity in cells transfected with pRc/CMV. Both A322G and R408Q
mutant PAH had a moderately decreased specific
activity, since their enzyme activities were reduced
while their immunoreactivities were close to normal (Table 1).
Correlation Between Mutation Genotype and
Clinical Phenotype

Eight of 9 mutant haplotype 12 alleles were
present in patients that had no or minimal dietary
treatment (Svensson et al., 1991b). One of these 8
as well as the ninth haplotype 12 allele carried
currently unidentified mutations. The remaining 7
haplotype 12 alleles carried either the A322G or
the R408Q mutation and were present in patients
with PAH genotypes A322GK408W (two patients), A322G/R252W, A322G/R408Q, R408Q/
Y414C, and R408Q/R408W. All of these patients
except one were on free diet and had serum phenylalanine values below 600 pM. Only the

slightly restricted phenylalanine intake (60-70 mg
kg body weight-' day-') to keep serum phenylalanine below 600 pM.
Table 2 shows the concentrations of neonatal
serum phenylalanine and serum phenylalanine at
5-10 years of age for the 6 patients. The four patients carrying an A322G allele had serum phenylalanine levels around 300 p M neonatally and
around 230 p M later in childhood, while the other
two patients had values above 800 pM neonatally

and above 500 pM later on. This indicates that
the higher activity of the A322G allele, relative to
the R408Q allele, is reflected in the biochemical
phenotype. The serum phenylalanine levels of all 4
A322G patients were roughly the same whether
the A322G mutation was combined with the
R40SQ mutation or a null mutation (R252W or
R408W). Thus, in these patients the contribution
of the higher activity R40SQ allele, relative to a
zero activity allele, did not affect the biochemical
phenotype.

DISCUSSION
Two novel missense mutations in the PAH
gene, A322G and R408Q, were identified through
sequence analysis of Swedish PKU and HPA patients. Both mutations were present exclusively on
mutant haplotype 12 chromosomes and segregated
in a Mendelian fashion in nuclear families. All
patients carrying either of these mutations had
mild HPA. Expression analysis of these mutant
PAH proteins demonstrated relatively high in
vitro activities, normal immunoreact ivit ies, and
consequently moderately reduced specific activities. These findings are consistent with previous
correlations between disease phenotype and in
vitro enzyme activity in this expression system.
In many studies the severity of a mutation has
been examined by introducing the mutation into a
cloned PAH cDNA and transiently expressing this
mutant construct in COS cells (DiLella et al.,
1987; Marvit et al., 1987; Lichter-Konecki et al.,
1988; Okano et al., 1990; Dworniczak et al., 1991;
Okano et al., 1991a,b,c; Wang et al., 1991;
Svensson et al., 1992). Most of the reported mutations in the PAH gene lead to little or no residual enzyme activity and are associated with a severe form of PKU. The R261Q and Y414C
mutations, however, have approximately 30 and
50% enzyme activity, respectively, in eukaryotic
expression analyses. Patients with either of these
two mutations have milder PKU or HPA (Okano
et al., 1990, 1991c; Svensson et al., 1992). The
levels of activity of these mutant proteins when
expressed in vitro in COS cells are most probably
higher than the corresponding values for the proteins when expressed in vivo in hepatocytes. Otherwise homozygotes for the Y414C mutation would

have the same capacity for phenylalanine hydroxylation as heterozygotes for a null mutation, which
is clearly not the case, since Y414C homozygotes
have hyperphenylalaninemia and heterozygotes do
not (Svensson et al., 1992).
We have recently shown that 8 or 9 mutant
haplotype 12 chromosomes in a Swedish PKU sample population are consistently found in very
mildly affected patients (Svensson et al., 1991). In
the current article, we present two single-base
changes that were separately found on 3 and 4 of
these 8 haplotype 12 chromosomes. Both mutations lead to an amino acid substitution, alanine to
glycine and arginine to glutamine. Since the immunoreactivity of these mutant enzymes was not
reduced, we conclude that these amino acid
changes do not alter the stability of the protein.
They do, however, cause a certain reduction of
enzyme activity, which is not surprising since they
are localized in catalytically active parts of the enzyme (Ledley et al., 1985a; Jennings et al., 1990).
Only two other PAH mutations have been reported to have a lowered specific activity; Rl58Q
mutant PAH has about 10% enzyme activity and
100% immunoreactivity when expressed in COS
cells (Okano et al., 1990, 1991b) while A194 mutant PAH from liver tissue obtained by needle biopsy has a reduced affinity for phenylalanine (Caillaud et al., 1991).
It is interesting to compare the effects of the
R408Q and R408W mutations. The original arginine at position 408 is flanked by prolines in a
stretch of aminoacids that interrupt a helix-like
sequence. This P-R-P motif is consistent with a
turn in this region, as indicated by several different
programs for the prediction of secondary structure

HAPLOTYPE 12 MUTATIONS CAUSING HPA

and by a search of proteins of known three-dimensional structure contained in the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) database. Replacement of
arginine with glutamine (R408Q) did not alter immunoreactivity and only moderately reduced enzyme activity. This finding may seem surprising
considering the charge change involved but is consistent with the high degree of structural similarity
between these two amino acids. Due to an amino
group situated at a similar position in the flexible
side chains of glutamine and arginine, these amino
acids probably have the potential to form similar
hydrogen bonds with another residue. In contrast,
replacement of the arginine at codon 408 with
tryptophan (R408W) could interfere with such a
hydrogen bond formation, since the bulkiness and
rigidity of tryptophan may preclude the right orientation of its corresponding potential hydrogen
donor. In addition it increases the relative hydrophobicity of this region. T h e R408W mutation apparently affects protein stability dramatically, since
there was no immunoreactive R408W PAH, and
thereby eliminates PAH enzyme activity. An interesting test of the role of the arginine at this
position would be the examination of the properties of an R408K mutant protein. Since lysine and
arginine are both positively charged and structurally similar, this is the most conservative change
possible at this position. Unless the 408 residue is
buried, in which case a replacement with lysine
would be energetically unfavorable, such a mutant
protein would be expected to have even higher
activity than the R408Q PAH.
Two studies have shown that the COS cell expression system can be used to arrange a wide variety of mutant PAH enzymes according to their
effect o n phenylalanine hydroxylation and consequently o n a clinical phenotype. Okano e t al.
(1991b) found a high correlation in Danish and
German PKU patients between biochemical phenotype (pretreatment phenylalanine levels or phenylalanine tolerance) and in vitro enzyme activity,
calculated as an average of the activities of the two
mutant enzymes. We have extended these observations to a Swedish PKU/HPA population including a higher proportion of mild cases (Svensson et
al., 1992). The reason for this excellent agreement
between the disease severity and a simple average
of the in vitro activities may be as follows. Most
characterized mutations result in a more or less
complete reduction of enzyme activity due to instability of the mutant protein. Compound heterozygotes for such a severe mutation and a mild
mutation, which causes little or no reduction in

135

stability, should form predominantly homopolymers of the mildly mutated PAH peptides. Homozygotes for the same mild mutation should, of
course, form only PAH homopolymers. In both
studies nearly all patients were either homozygotes
for a null mutation or a mild mutation or compound heterozygotes for a null mutation and a mild
mutation. They would therefore be expected to
form homopolymers almost exclusively.
The results presented in this article both confirm the usefulness of the COS cell expression system and demonstrate some of its limitations. First,
the in vitro activities of A322G PAH (75%) and
R408Q PAH (55%) are higher than any other reported in vitro activity for a mutant PAH tested in
the same expression system. This finding is in good
agreement with the presence of these mutations
only in very mildly affected patients. However,
these substantial in vitro activities are most likely
higher than the corresponding in vivo activities
and they cannot be used to assess the absolute hepatic PAH activities in patients carrying either of
these mutations. Second, the data presented in
this article clearly show that the relative capacity
for phenylalanine hydroxylation in different patients cannot always be accurately predicted from
the average in vitro activities. We have two examples of patients in whom a high average in vitro
activity did not result in a milder disease than that
of a patient with a lower average in vitro activity.
The R408Q/Y414C patient (53% average in vitro
activity) had higher serum phenylalanine levels
than the two A322G/R408W patients and one
A322G/R252W patient, i.e., A322G/null allele
patients (38% average in vitro activity). In addition, the A322G/R408Q patient (65% average in
vitro activity) could not be clinically separated
from the A322Ghull mutation patients (38% average in vitro activity).
O n e reason for these observations could be that
the relative activity of the A322G PAH was underestimated and that it is really high enough to
make the contribution from a mutant PAH with
much less activity marginal. Since the ratio of
A322G PAH and R408Q activity was roughly the
same in all experiments, laboratory errors in this
direction are unlikely. Perhaps the COS cells are
different from the hepatocytes in a way that leads
to underestimation of the activity of not only normal PAH, but also (to a lesser extent) the A322G
PAH relative to the activities of other mutant
PAH enzymes, which would then indirectly be
overestimated. This could occur if the normal and
A322G mutant alleles are much more responsive

136

SVENSSON ET AL.

than the other alleles to positive regulatory mechanisms in hepatocytes in vivo (but not in COS
cells in vitro).
An alternative explanation for the phenotypic
similarity between the A322G/R408Q and
A322Glnull mutation patients is that most
A322G/R408Q individuals are so mildly affected
that they are not identified through the neonatal
screening. The selection of patients for this study
would then be biased toward the most severely affected among the A322G/R408Q individuals and
our A322G/R408Q patient would be a nonrepresentative phenotypic extreme. Yet another possibility is that negative interallelic complementation
is operating in the A322G/R408Q patient. In general, alleles with high activity mutations dominate
over alleles with low activity mutations (Avigad et
al., 1991; Okano e t al., 1991b; Svensson e t al.,
1992) and there is no direct evidence yet for negative interallelic complementation effects in PKU.
Such evidence will, however, be difficult to obtain
from a single population, since the prime prerequisite for negative interallelic complementation,
the presence of two different stable PAH polypeptides, is very rare (excluding heterozygotes). This
prerequisite is present in both the A322GIR408Q
and the R408Q/Y414C patients, but the clinical
data are only compatible with such a mechanism
occurring in the A322G/R408Q patient, since the
R408QN414C patient (53% average in vitro activity) is not more severely affected than five
Y414C/Y414C patients (50% average in vitro activity) (Svensson et al., 1992).
This study provides an example of how the
search for mutations can be focused o n a particularly interesting group of patients through the combined information about RFLP haplotypes and
phenylaline tolerance. It also shows how an identified substitution can be determined to produce a
disease phenotype, not only by establishing its exclusive presence o n mutant alleles and its segregation with mutant alleles in families, but also by
demonstrating its reduced in vitro enzyme activity.
The reported mutations are the first to be identified on a haplotype 12 background, and they are
the mildest PKU/HPA mutations that have yet
been identified and characterized. Together with
the Y414C mutation, these mutations account for
a majority of the mutant alleles responsible for the
HPA phenotype in Scandinavian populations.
The high degree of genetic heterogeneity at the
PAH locus most likely explains the broad and continuous spectrum of phenotypes observed in hyperphenylalaninemic disorders (disregarding the few

patients with biopterin deficiency). The presence
of a few different classes of mutant proteins has
blurred the boundaries between phenotypic subgroups. T h e presence of extremely mild mutations
may even blur the boundary between benign HPA
patients and phenotypically normal individuals. It
would not be surprising if a number of phenotypically normal individuals are, in fact, compound
heterozygotes for mutant PAH proteins having
slight but detectable decreases in PAH activity.
Such individuals, if they do exist, will be detected
as more mild mutant alleles are identified and
characterized, and their prevalence in the general
population is determined.
