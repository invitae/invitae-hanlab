The periodic
paralyses
are a group
of autosomal
dominant muscle
diseases
sharing
a common
feature
of episodic
paralysis.
In one form,
paramyotonia
congenita
(PC), the paralysis
usually
occurs
with
muscle
cooling.
Electrophysiologic
studies
of muscle
from
PC patients
have revealed
temperature-dependent
alterations
in sodium
channel
(NaCh)
function.
This observation
led to
demonstration
of genetic
linkage
of a skeletal
muscle
NaCh gene to a PC disease
allele. We now report
the use
of the single-strand
conformation
polymorphism
technique to define
alleles specific
to PC patients
from three
families.
Sequencing
of these
alleles
defined
base pair
changes
within
the same codon,
which
resulted
in two
distinct
amino
acid substitutions
for a highly
conserved
arginine
residue
in the S4 helix of domain
4 in the adult
skeletal
muscle
NaCh.
These data establish
the chromosome 17q NaCh
locus as the PC gene and represent
two
mutations
causing
the distinctive,
temperature-sensitive
PC phenotype.
Introduction
The periodic
paralyses
are a group
of neuromuscular
diseases
with overlapping
clinical
and electrophysiological
features
and
include
hyperkalemic
periodic
paralysis
(HYPP),
hypokalemic
periodic
paralysis,
and
paramyotonia
congenita
(PC). Patients
with these
disorders
share
the common
feature
of episodic
weakness. Some of these
patients
also demonstrate
clinical
and electrophysiological
myotonia,
a form
of abnormal electrical
activity
consisting
of repetitive
action
potentials
on electromyography
associated
with
delayed
relaxation
of muscle
(Riggs
and Griggs,
1979).

Attacks

of paralysis

and

myotonia

may

occur

sponta-

neously
or may be precipitated
by factors
including
exercise,
alterations
of extracellular
potassium
levels,
and muscle
cooling.
The particular
precipitants
of attacks
in patients
are often
useful
in classifying
such
individuals
clinically.
For example,
HYPP is one type
in which
potassium
loading
can precipitate
attacks.
Serum
potassium
levels
may
be normal
or elevated
during
an attack,
thus
distinguishing
such
patients
from
those
with
hypokalemic
periodic
paralysis.
PC is an autosomal
dominant
myotonic
disorder
characterized
by cold-induced,
prolonged,
localized
muscle
contraction
and weakness
(Riggs
and Griggs,
1979). Muscle
activity
aggravates
the myotonia
associated with
PC (paradoxical
myotonia),
in contrast
to
the usual
improvement
with
exercise
seen
in most
myotonic
disorders
(classical
myotonia).
Most
patientswithPCdemonstratesomedegreeofworsening
of myotonia
with potassium
loading.
Patients
with
PC
may
experience
episodes
of generalized
weakness
(periodic
paralysis)
unassociated
with cold exposure.
In the “pure”
form
of PC, these
attacks
of weakness
areassociated
with normo-or
hypokalemia.
However,
there
are patients
with otherwise
typical
PC in whom
attacks
of generalized
weakness
can be precipitated
by potassium
loading
(Riggs,
1988).
Electrophysiological
investigation
of HYPP and PC
muscle
in vitro
has demonstrated
alteration
of muscle
membrane
sodium
conductance
(Lehmann-Horn
et
al., 1981, 1987a,
1987b;
Rude1 et al., 1989), suggesting
that the molecular
alteration
may reside
in a skeletal
muscle
sodium
channel
(NaCh)
gene.
This was supported
by genetic
linkage
of SCN4A, the gene encoding the adult
isoform
of the NaCh
a subunit,
to HYPP
(Fontaine
et al., 1990; Pt%ek
et al., 1991a; Ebers et al.,
1991; Koch
et al., 1991a) and PC (PtaEek
et al., 1991b;
Ebers
et al., 1991; Koch
et al., 1991b).
An interesting
potassium-sensitiveformof
myotoniacongenitawithout periodic
paralysis
is also genetically
linked
to this
locus
(PtaEek
et al., 1992). Identification
of twodistinct
mutations
in SCN4A from
HYPP patient
DNA
established
SCN4A as the HYPP gene (Ptacek
et al., 1991~;
Rojas et al., 1991).
The unique
features
of PC suggest
that one or more
mutations
in SCNM,
different
from
those
causing
HYPP, might
be responsible
for the disorder.
Furthermore,
identification
of mutations
in DNA
from
PC
patients
is required
to demonstrate
that SCN4A is the
PC gene
rather
than
a closely
linked
marker
for another
chromosome
17q gene.
We therefore
undertook
a search
for
mutations
in the
human
gene
(SCN4A) that encodes
the tetrodotoxin-sensitive
adult
skeletal
muscle
NaCh
isoform
(hSkM?),
using
singlestrand
conformation
polymorphism
(SSCP)
analysis
(Orita
et al., 1989a,
1989b)
in an attempt
to demonstrate
that
PC results
from
molecular
alterations
in
this protein.

PCR amplification
of the three most 3’ exons of SCN4A was performed
with four primer pairs. Na.f/Na.r
and Nb.f/Nb.r
were designed
to allow amplification
of the sequence
of exon N that encodes
S4-S6 of M&Ml domain 4; N-l.f/N-1.r
and N-2.f/N-2.r
were used to amplify
D4iSl-S3
and the 3-4 interdomain,
respectively.
The sequence
of these primers
and their relationship
to exons N-2, N-l, and N are
shown.

Sequence

as shifts

of single-strand

on nondenaturing

strands
of a
DNA segment
usually
resolve
as two SSCP conformers

are
identified
by differences

among
the DNAs
of the sample
set. SSCP has proven
useful
in the analysis of other
disease-causing
mutations,
such as cystic
fibrosis,
neurofibromatosis
type 1, familial
polyposis,
and HYPP,
in which
DNA
sequence
variations
have
been characterized
successfully
at the level of single
base substitutions
(Dean
et al., 1990; Cawthon
et al.,
1990; Groden
et al., 1991; Ptacek
et al., 1991c).
Results
Evaluation
of Patients
PC patients
in kindred
1637 have been
reported
previously
(Rich,
1894; Ptdcek
et al., 1991b).
The affected
individuals
in this family
have spontaneous
episodic
attacks
of quadriparesis
and
myotonia
that
is provoked
by muscle
cooling.
No potassium
sensitivity
has been
reported
by these
patients,
but formal
potassium
challenge
has never
been performed.
Patients
from
kindred
1800 have
been
reported
elsewhere
(Riggs
et al., 1977) and have similar
cold-induced
myotonia
and
attacks
of periodic
paralysis.
Potassium
loading
in oneof
these
patients
resulted
in worsening
of the myotonia
but improvement
of strength.
Patients
in kindred
1984 also have the pure
form
of PC
with periodic
paralysis
and myotonia
that is provoked
by cooling.
The patient
whose
DNA we studied
has
undergone
a potassium
challenge,
which
resulted
in
severe,
generalized
muscle
stiffness
and pain, a slight
increase
in myotonia,
but
no change
in strength
(Griggs,
1978).
Partial
Cenomic
Organization
of SCN4A
Intron-exon
boundaries
in SCN4A
were

determined

by sequencing
genomic
clone
hlO.l
(George
et al.,
1992a)
with
oligonucleotide
primers
designed
from
the cDNA
sequence
of hSkM7
(George
et al., 1992b).
Twelve
exons
encompassing
codons
615-1837
and
ranging
in size from
54-2248
bp were
defined
in a
region
of approximately
20 kb. Three
exons
(enumerated
in a 3’ to 5’ direction
as N, 2248 bp; N-l, 270
bp; and N-2, 104 bp) contain
the coding
sequence
corresponding
to the carboxyl
terminus,
domain
4,
and the interdomain
3-4 region.
Four pairs
of oligonucleotide
primers
(Figure
1) were
designed
for use
in amplifying
regions
of these
exons
that encode
domain 4 and the 3-4 interdomain.
Identification
of Nucleotide
Alterations
in PC Patient
DNA
The very
high
degree
of conservation
of DNA
and
amino
acid sequence
in the membrane-spanning
segments
of the NaCh
and the presence
of HYPP mutations in these
regions
led us toconcentrateour
search
for PC mutations
in the repeat
domains.
Patients
from
all three
PC families
demonstrated
aberrant
conformers (Figure
2) when
investigated
with
SSCP analysis
with
primer
set Na.f/Na.r.
No abnormalities
were
noted
with
SSCP using
the remaining
three
primer
sets (data not shown).
The pattern
of aberrant
banding
appeared
similar
in all three
families
studied,
thus
suggesting
that all three
families
might
have the same
mutation.
Alternatively,
different
mutations
may yield
the same aberrant
bands
if they alter the electrophoretie mobility
similarly.
The aberrant
pattern
seen in
the three
PC patients
was not seen
in the DNA
of
106 unrelated,
normal
individuals
whose
DNA
was
evaluated
by SSCP.
Transmission

The aberrant

pattern
was shown
to cosegregate with the disease
allele in kindreds
1637 and 1800.
The aberrant

were
present
in all affected
individuals
in these
families
and in none

Sequence

DNA eluted
from
the SSCP bands
was sequenced
and
revealed
three
different
patterns.
The first (Figure
3a)
corresponds
to the normal
hSkM7
sequence.
The second (Figure
3b), present
in patient
#I2088
from
kindred 1637, demonstrates
a C to T transition
at position
4419 of hSkM1 (George
et al., 199213). When
read
in
frame,
this represents
a first position
change
resulting
in substitution
of an arginine
by a cysteine
residue.
The third
pattern
(Figures
3c and 3d), in patient
#I3195
from
kindred
1800 and patient
#I3688
from
kindred
1984, revealed
a G to A transition
at position
4420 of
hSkM7 (George
et al., 1992b).
When
read in frame,
this
second
position
change
leads
to substitution
of the
same
arginine
residue
by a histidine.
The
normal
hSkMl and mutant
DNA sequence
in the region
of the
mutations
are aligned
in Figure
4. These
alterations
occur
in the same codon
encoding
a highly
conserved
arginine
residue
in the fourth
putative
membranespanning
segment
(S4) of domain
4 (Figure
5).
These
nucleotide
substitutions
occurred
within
the
context
of a CpG
dimer.
The majority
of methylation
in human
DNA occurs
on the cytosine
in CpG dimer
sequences;
this interferes
with efficient
correction
of
C to T transitions
resulting
from
5-methyl
cytosine
deamination.
These
sites are, therefore,
potential
hot
spots for mutation
in either
strand
(Barker
et al., 1984).
One of the two mutations
already
described
in HYPP
demonstrated
a C toT transition
(PtaCek
et al., 1991c).

Mutation
PC 1 occurs
in kindred
1637, and mutation
PC 2 was
found in kindreds
1800 and 1984. The CGT codon encoding
the
arginine
at position
1448 in the normal sequence,
along with the
two mutant codons,
is enclosed
by the rectangle.
In PC 1, a C to
T transition
was found in the first position
of this codon, thus
encoding
a cysteine
residue. In PC 2, a G to A transition
is noted
at the second position
of this codon, thus encoding
a histidine
residue.

Discussion
PC is a rare hereditary
disease
characterized
by autosomal
dominant
transmission,
myotonia
that is accentuated
by exposure
to cold and worsened
by exercise,
and attacks
of muscular
weakness
or flaccid
paralysis
that are induced
by muscle
cooling
(Riggs
and Griggs,
1979). Although
often
considered
as a distinct
clinical
entity
separate
from
the HYPPs,
PC is
now known
to be one of a variety
of related
clinical
syndromes
including
HYPP that are caused
by structural
lesions
in the adult
skeletal
muscle
voltagedependent
NaCh.
Voltage-dependent
NaChs
are intrinsic
membrane
proteins
that consist
of a single
large polypeptidewith
a molecular
weight
of -260,000,
containing
1800-2000
aa and 25%-30%
complex
carbohydrate
by weight.
Within
this large
protein
are four
regions
of internal
homology,
each
encompassing
225-325
aa. Analysis
of these
repeat
domains
identifies
at least six potential
transmembrane
helices
at conserved
locations
in
each domain.
The most striking
of these
is the S4 helix,
which
contains
a repeating
(x-x-Arg/Lys)
motif
that results
in the presence
of a positively
charged
amino
acid at every
third
position.
This helix
is thought
to
play a central
role in voltage-dependent
channel
activation.
While
voltage-dependent
NaChs
from
all species
share
a common
architecture,
there
are multiple
forms
of NaChs
that can be expressed
in different
tissues
of a single
species,
or even at the same
time
within
the same tissue
(Barchi,
1987). These
isoforms
differ
predominantly
in the sequence
of their
amino
and carboxyl
termini
and in the regions
linking
the
internal
repeat
domains.
At least six NaCh
isoforms
have been characterized
in rat (Noda
et al., 1986; Kayano et al., 1988; Trimmer
et al., 1989; Rogart
et al., 1989;
Kallen
et al., 1990), and the NaCh
isoform
expressed
in human
adult
skeletal
muscle
(hSkM7)
has recently
been
cloned
and sequenced
(George
et al., 1992b).
This
channel
isoform
is the product
of the SCN4A
gene
(George
et al., 1991).
In PC, cooling
of skeletal
muscle
leads first to hyperexcitability
and then,
in some
cases,
to paralysis.

the temperature

et al., 1987b).
This
depolarization
is associated
with the appearance
of an
abnormally
large membrane
conductance
to sodium
ions that can be blocked
by tetrodotoxin
and presumably involves
voltage-dependent
NaChs.
Support
for
a roleof
NaChs
in the pathogenesisof
this disease
has
recently
been
provided
by genetic
analyses
in which
tight
linkage
was demonstrated
between
the expression of the PC phenotype
in affected
families
and the
presence
of characteristic
restriction
fragment
length
polymorphisms
at the adult
skeletal
muscle
NaCh
gene
locus
(Ptatek
et al., 1991b;
Ebers
et al., 1991).
We now confirm
this role by documenting
specific
mutations
that occur
in the NaCh
gene SCN4A
in PC
patient
DNA.
The occurrence
of nucleotide
sequence
alterations
in the adult
skeletal
muscle
NaCh
that cosegregate
with the PC phenotype
in three
unrelated
families
and
the absence
of these
abnormalities
in 106 unrelated

individuals
argue
that mutations
in hSkM7
are
the molecular
basis
for this syndrome
in these
families. Both of the abnormalities
described
here result
in similar
SSCP mobility
shifts.

of hSkM1

conserved
in all known
NaCh
sequences
across

species
(Figure

The mutations
replace
this arginine
residue
with
either cysteine
or histidine
and therefore
neutralize
this
highly
conserved
S4 positive
charge
(the charge
on
histidine
[pKa = 61 will be dependent
on its local environment,
but is not likely
to have
a strong
positive
charge).
The location
of the two PC NaCh
mutations
is distinct
from
the two
reported
HYPP
mutations
(PtZek
et al., 1991c; Rojas et al., 1991), and this molecular heterogeneity
is likely
to be responsible
for differences
in the clinical
presentation
of these
two syndromes.

mutations

for all cases
of PC,
since
we have been
unable
to detect
the same
SSCP
abnormality
in three
other
families
with the same disease phenotype
(unpublished
data).
Although
the
exact
functional
consequences
of
neutralizing
arginine
1448 in hSkM7
can only
be revealed
by a detailed
electrophysiologic
study
of the
mutant
channel
itself,
some
insight
can be gained
from
studies
of the effects
of S4 segment
mutations
in other
voltage-dependent
sodium
and potassium
channels.
Site-directed
mutagenesis
experiments
involving
the S4 segment
of the rat brain
II NaCh
and
the Shaker
B potassium
channel
support
the hypothesis that this segment
does act as the voltage
sensor
in
the biophysical
mechanism
of activation
(Stuhmer
et
al., 1989; Papazian
et al., 1991). Substitution

acid for individual

Ilchannel
decreases
the steepness
of the voltage
dependence
of activation
and shifts
the midpoint
of the activation
curve
along
the voltage
axis (Stuhmer
et al., 1989).
Mutations
neutralizing
charges
in the
Shaker
potassium
channel
S4 have a less predictable
effect,
but
also shift
both
the slope
of the activation
curve
and
the location
of the curve
on the voltage
axis. In addition,
S4 mutations
in the Shaker
potassium
channel
indicate
coupling
between
channel
activation
and inactivation.
A characteristic
of the PC phenotype
is the presence
of both
cold-induced
myotonia
and
intermittent
weakness,
suggesting
that a single
mutation
near the
amino
terminus
of the S4 helix of domain
4can,
under
different
physiological
circumstances,
lead to either
repetitive
NaCh
activation
or failure

paralysis.
Although
repetitive
activity
could
result
from a shift in the voltage
dependence
either
of activation to more
negative
potentials
or of inactivation
to
more
positive
potentials,
the persistent
sodium
currents
reported
in electrophysiological
recordings
from
PC muscle
(Lehmann-Horn
et al., 1987b)
suggest
that channel
inactivation
may be the process
that is
primarily
affected.
It has been
shown
that failure
of
NaCh
inactivation,
even
in a small percentage
of the
channel
population,
can lead to membrane
depolarization,
inactivation
of the other
normal
NaChs,
and
muscle
paralysis
(Cannon
et al., 1991).
Given
the effects of S4 mutations
in Shaker,
it is also possible
that
the mutations
described
here could
affect
both inactivation
and activation.
However,
sincethese
mutations
insert
different
amino
acids
than
the substitution
studied
at the comparable
location
in Shaker,
this
point
can only
be resolved
through
the study
of the
mutated
PC channel
expressed
in vitro.
The temperature
sensitivity
of symptoms
is an interesting
aspect
of the PC phenotype,
and we can speculate as to how this relates
to NaCh
defects.
Structural
changes
due to the mutations
reported
here
might
alter the relative
energy
levels
of various
conformations
associated
with different
NaCh
gating
modes.
If
the factors
stabilizing
such
states
differ
in their
entropic
contributions
between
mutant
and wild-type
channels,
changes
in temperature
may differentially
affect
the preferred
channel
conformation
in each
case, and lower
temperatures
might
serve to stabilize
the mutant
channel
in a state associated
with
an abnormal
gating
mode.
This might
be anticipated
if, for
example,
hydrophobic
interactions
play a prominent
role in stabilizing
a particular
conformation.
Alternatively,
the mutations
may render
the channel
abnormally
sensitive
to other
cellular
processes
that are
themselves
temperature
sensitive,
such as phosphorylation
or G protein
interaction.
Ultimately,
the correlation
between
the mutations
described
here and the
pathophysiology
of excitation
in PC will require
the
expression
and analysis
of human
skeletal
muscle
NaChs
in which
this mutation
has been
introduced.
Experimental

Procedures

Identification
of PC Patients
PC patients
with well-documented
disease
were
identified
through
the Muscular
Dystrophy
Association
clinics at the University
of Utah, the University
of Rochester,
and the University

Neuron
896

of West Virginia.
Each patient was examined
by one of the authors (L. J. P., R. C. G., and J. E. R.). All family members,
including
unaffected
individuals
and spouses,
were examined
whenever
possible.
All human
tissue samples
used in this project
were
obtained
with the approval
of the Institutional
Review Board at
the University
of Utah Health Sciences
Center.
Tissue Culture
Epstein-Barr virus
was used to transform
lymphocytes
from normal and PC individuals.
These lymphoblastoid
cell lines then
were cultured
at 37OC, 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium
(Cellgroi
Mediatech)
containing
1% Nutridoma
(Boehringer
Mannheim),
5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone),
and 50 Ulmlgentamicin
sulfate.
Patient DNA was obtained
directly
from peripheral
blood by
phenol-chloroform
extraction.
PCR Amplification
DNA samples were amplified
for SSCP analysis
using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (3 min at 94OC, 1 time; 1 min at 94OC,
1 min at annealing
temperature,
1 min at 72OC, 30 times). The
annealing
temperature
for each reaction was bT-8°C
below the
T, for the primers.
The reaction
mixture
was made up of the
following:
200 ng of DNA, 0.5 uM of each primer,
70 uM of each
deoxynucleoside
triphosphate,
10 mM Tris (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCI,
1.5 mM MgCI,, 0.01% gelatin, 0.25 U of Taq polymerase,
and
0.1 ul of [a-32P]dCTP (3000 Cilml) in a volume
of 10 ~1.
SSCP Gel Analysis
PCR products
were diluted in 50 ul of a mixture containing
0.1%
SDSandlOmM
EDTA. Fivemicrolitersofthismixturewasfurther
diluted with 6 ul of running buffer (95% formamide,
20 mM EDTA,
0.05% bromphenol
blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol).
Products
were
denatured
at 94OC for 3 min and kept on ice until 3 ul of each
sample was loaded onto 5% polyacrylamidegels.
Twoconditions
were run for each set of reactions:
a 90 mM Tris-borate
(pH 7.5),
2 mM EDTA gel at 4OC and a 90 mM Tris-borate
(pH 7.5), 2 mM
EDTA, 10% glycerol
gel at room temperature.
Electrophoresis
was carried out for both conditions
at a constant
power of 40 W.
After electrophoresis,
gels were transferred
to Whatmann
3MM
paper and dried on vacuum
slab dryers.
Autoradiography
with
Kodak X-Omat AR film was performed
with intensifying
screens
for 24-36 hr.
Sequencing
of SSCP Conformers
Individual
SSCP bands were cut directly
from the dried gels,
placed in 100 ul of distilled
water, shaken
for 30 min at room
temperature,
and centrifuged
briefly. A 10 ul aliquot of this supernatant
was used for PCR amplification
with primers 5’upNa.f
3’ and 5’rpNa.r
3’ (up- and rp- represent
the -2lM13
universal
and reverse primer
sequences,
respectively).
Reaction
mixture
was as follows:
0.5 uM of each primer,
10 mM Tris (pH 8.3), 50
mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCb, 0.01% gelatin, 2.5 nmol of dNTP mixture.
Samples were vortexed,
spun down, placed on ice, and overlayered with mineral oil. Two units of Taq polymerase
were added
to each reaction.
Reactions
were placed in a preheated
DNA
thermal
cycler at 94OC and run with the following
parameters:
94OC, 1 min; 55OC, 1 min; 72OC, 1 min (30 times). Amplified
products were resolved
on 4% agarose
gels (Maniatis
et al., 1982)
and isolated from the gel with Geneclean
(Bio 101, La Jolla, CA).
These products
were sequenced
using the dideoxy
termination
method
(Sanger
et al., 1977), with fluorescently
tagged Ml3
universal
or reverse
sequencing
primers
on an applied
Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencer
(Applied Biosystems,
Foster
City, CA).
