We have previously reported that the steroidogenic activity of the bovine placentome is stimulated by a calcium-mediated, cyclic nucleotide-independent mechanism and that this steroidogenesis is limited by the availability of sterol substrate to the side-chain cleavage enzyme. We have recently established that the antibody against bovine adrenal cytochrome P-450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P-450scc) can be used to specifically detect P-450scc in both bovine placentome and corpus luteum. In the present study, we used an immunogold technique to localize the P-450scc in the bovine placentome by electron microscopy. The mononucleate cell of the cotyledon showed both giant and normal-sized mitochondria, with the latter, predominating. Both mitochondrial types found in the mononucleate cells clearly displayed gold particles located on the cristae; in contrast, these particles were absent in the binucleate cells. It is worth noting that giant mitochondria were found exclusively in the placental mononucleate cells in both the fetal and maternal sites but not in the binucleate cells. These findings suggest that the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme is present in bovine cotyledon cells, primarily in mononucleate cells. The variations in P-450scc immunoreactivity among different cells of the placenta are suggestive of different steroidogenetic capacities of the cells.
