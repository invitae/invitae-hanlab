DNA samples from 25 unrelated Danish patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) were
screened by Southern blot hybridization to detect gross alterations in the low density lipoprotein
(LDL) receptor gene. Three FH-patients were found to have a deletion. Two of these delete
part of the cysteine rich domain, which comprises the ligand binding region of the LDLreceptor. The third deletion encompasses coding regions for the cytoplasmic part of the receptor.
As two of these deletions could be equivalent to previously described LDL-receptor gene
alterations, these data seem to support a notion of recombination hot spots which involve Alusequences.

gene of FH-patients including deletions, insertions (Fig. I), and nonsense mutations.
To our knowledge, a total of 29 deletions
have been reported, including the three described in the present paper (summarized in
Table 1).
The diversity of mutations responsible for
FH has complicated the development of
molecular assays to diagnose mutations at
this locus. In some populations, however, a
founder effect has been described with a

specific mutation accounting for up to 60%
of the genetic defects in FH-subjects (Hobbs
et al. 1987).
Familial hypercholesterolemia in Denmark has been the subject of several previous studies (Kornerup 1948, Jensen et al.
1967, Johansen et al. 1982). The present
study was initiated to describe the genetic
variation among Danish FH patients. We

DNA Preparation
DNA was isolated from EDTA or ACD
blood by the technique of Gustafson et al.
(1 987). Cel!s frozen at 80°C were thawed
and centrifuged. The plasma was discarded
and replaced by one volume phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After a second round of
centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended
in nucleus-lysis buffer (0.075 mol/l NaC1,
0.025 mol/l EDTA, pH 8.0) and the DNA
was extracted from the leukoqjte nuclei
essentially as described by Kunkel et al.
(1977).

Southern Blotting
DNA (5-10 pg) was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes under conditions as recommended by the manufacturer (Pharmacia). Cleaved DNA was sizefractionated by gel-electrophoresis through
a 0.7% agarose gel. Southern blotting onto
Zeta membrane (Bio-Rad) was performed
at room temperature for 20 h.
After the end of the transfer, the Zeta
membrane was neutralized and dried in air
before baking at 80°C in a vacuum oven.
Hybridization
Two cDNA probes were used for hybridization: A 1.7-kb HindIII/BglII fragment containing sequences from exon 1-1 1 (“5’-1.7”)
and a 1.9-kb BamHI fragment encompassing sequences from exon 11 to exon 18
(“3’-1.9”) of the cDNA clone pLDL-R3.
The pLDL-R3 cDNA clone was obtained

FH-DK2, the Deletion in Family 2
Screening with XbaI and BglII located the
gene rearrangement in Family 2 to the 5'
half of the gene. The size of the deleted
sequence could be estimated from these data
to be approximately 9 kb, decreasing the 23
kb XbaI fragment to 14 kb (Fig. 4). The
data from BglII, EcoRI (not shown) and
EcoRV (Fig. 4) cleavages locate the downstream deletion break point to 5' of the 6
kb EcoRV fragment (Fig. 2). Double digests
with EcoRV and KpnI hybridized with the
5'-1.7 probe reveal that the KpnI site in
intron 2 is lost (not shown) and the 5' crossover point of the deletion must therefore
be located upstream from the KpnI site.
Because the distance between the KpnI and
EcoRV sites is about 10 kb, and intron 7 is
only about 0.45 kb, it seems likely that the 3'
crossover point of the deletion lies upstream
from exon 7. Since neither the EcoRI site
in exon 5 nor the EcoRI site in intron 6 are
present, it can be deduced that the 5' break
point of the deletion is located in intron 2.
This deletion of 9 kb has thus removed exon
3-6.
FH-DK 3 the Deletion in Family 3
Screening with XbaI and BglII unambiguously located the gene variation in Family

3 within the borders of the BglII 13 kb
fragment (Fig. 5). The aberration became
obvious upon cleavage with EcoRI (Fig. 5).
In addition to the normal bands of 9 and
19 kb, an additional band of about 11 kb
appeared. Such a fragment could either be
the product of a point mutation in the EcoRI site in intron 6 or the result of an alteration of a fragment encompassing the EcoRI site in exon 5. However, it can be deduced from the combined BglII and EcoRI
analyses that the genetic variant found in
IP and JP is a deletion of 1 kb which removes exon 5.
Discussion

The molecular basis of familial hyprcholesterolemia has been studied by several research groups. The studies have disclosed a
large genetic heterogeneity of mutations at
the LDL-R gene locus. Most of the characterized mutations in this gene are deletions
and insertions (summarized in Table l), but
duplications and point mutations have also
been reported (Lehrman et al. 1987a). It is
generally agreed that the LDL-R gene is
particularly susceptible to deletions, assumed to be caused by mispairing of homologous chromosomes and unequal crossing

LDL-receptor genes (Leitersdorf et al.
1989). The presence of a founder gene in
a localized population may contribute to
differences in the proportion of deletions
relative to single base pair mutations found
in different areas.
The stringency of the clinical diagnosis
FH may also have great impact on all frequency estimates made for defects in the
LDL-R-gene. Our FH diagnosis was based
on rather strict criteria (including hypercholesterolemia), requiring tendon xanthomas in the proband or in first-degree
relatives and a family history of premature
atherosclerosis. The data presented in Table
2 sustain the validity of these criteria, as the
clinical traits of the FH diagnosis cosegregated with the genetic findings of a mutated
gene.
The three different deletions found in this
study have been mapped to different sites
in the gene using the published restriction
map and exon-specific probes (Siidhof et
al. 1985, Yamamoto et al. 1984). Deletions
found in FH-DK 2 ( -exons 3-6) and FHDK 3 ( -exon 5) delete sequences coding
for the cysteine-rich part of the receptor.
Because the crossover positions are located
in introns and all introncxon junctions of
the first 8 exons are in the same translation
frame (Siidhof et al. 1985), both the FH-DK
2 and FH-DK 3 deletions are anticipated to
produce translatable mRNA's of 4.5 and 5.3
kb, respectively. The molecular weight of
the translated non-processed proteins would
be expected to decline from 120 kDa to 84
kDa and 115 kDa in FH-DK 2 and FHDK 3, respectively. However, Hobbs et al.
(1986) have shown that FH-626 (-exon 5 )
produces a 100 kDa protein, which abolishes binding of ApoB. The same should
also hold true for FH-DK 3 and the deletion
of exons 3-6 in FH-DK 2.
Previous findings have implicated sequences from exon 17 and exon 18 in the process of recycling of the receptor in coated pits

(Goldstein et al. 1985, Davis et al. 1986,
Lehnnan et al. 1985a, b). If the FH-DK 1
mRNA splice out the intron sequences correctly, the variant mRNA will be out of the
correct translation frame from the junction
point of exon 16 and exon 18. The resulting
protein will be three aminoacids shorter and
have a quite different C-terminal aminoacid
composition. We anticipate that this results
in a nonfunctional receptor of a different
length.
The deletions found in FH-DK 1 and 3
are most interesting, as these may turn out
to be equivalent to deletions found by others
(Hobbs et al. 1986, Horsthemke et al. 1987a,
Langlois et al. 1988). Precise characterization of the deletion found in FH-DK 3 is in
progress in our laboratory.
Of the deletions characterized, six have
been defined at the molecular level. Five of
these are the result of recombination between repetitive elements found at the deletion breakpoint. The duplication of exons
2-8 reported by Lehrman et al. (1987a),
FH-295, was also the result of an Alu-Alu
recombination. Alu repeats are found in
high numbers in introns 1-8 and 12-17 and
in a lower frequency in introns 9-1 1 (Langlois et al. 1988). Taken together, these findings together with the observed clustering
of major rearrangements in the S-end and
Y-end of the gene (Fig. 1) support the notion that Alu-Alu recombination is the most
common mechanism for major rearrangements in the LDL-receptor gene.
Deletion of exon 5 is now reported to be
present in at least three (FH-626, PO/JA,
FH-DK 3) out of 30 reported cases of gross
LDL-receptor gene rearrangements. Characterization of these three deletions may
give additional information about the mechanism of recombination and possible hotspot cross-over points in this gene. We have
therefore initiated complete characterization of FH-DK 3 to determine the exact
breakpoint in this deletion.
