Summary

Galactosemia is an autosomal recessive disorder of human galactose metabolism caused by deficiency of the
enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT). The molecular basis of this disorder is at present
not well understood. We report here two missense mutations which result in low or undetectable enzymatic
activity. First, we identified at nucleotide 591 a transition which substitutes glutamine 188 by arginine. The
mutated glutamine is not only highly conserved in evolution (conserved also in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), but it is also two amino acid residues downstream from the active site histidine-prolinehistidine triad and results in about 10% of normal enzymatic activity. The arginine 188 mutation is the most
common galactosemia mutation characterized to date. It accounts for one-fourth of the galactosemia alleles
studied. Second, we report the substitution of arginine 333 by tryptophan, caused by a transition at nucleotide
1025. The area surrounding this missense mutation is the most highly conserved domain in the homologous
enzymes from E. coli, yeast, and humans, and this mutation results in undetectable enzymatic activity,
suggesting that this is a severe mutation. This second mutation appears to be rare, since it was found only
in the patient we sequenced. Our data provide further evidence for the heterogeneity of galactosemia at the
molecular level, heterogeneity which might be related to the variable clinical outcome observed in this
disorder.

Introduction

Galactosemia (McKusick 230400), an inborn error of
galactose metabolism, is caused by deficiency of human galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT;
E.C.2.7.7.12; Segal 1989). Early symptoms include
vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, and failure to thrive.
Later, untreated infants often develop cataracts, and
death due to sepsis is not uncommon. These symptoms
can be avoided by placing afflicted patients on a
galactose-restricted diet. Therefore, many states and

foreign countries have instituted newborn-screening
programs. Unfortunately, well-managed patients develop late-onset complications such as neurologic abnormalities and ovarian failure (Waisbren et al. 1983;
Steinmann and Gitzelmann 1984; Kaufman et al.
1988).
Relatively little is known about the molecular basis
of this disorder. Detailed knowledge of the characteristics of galactosemia mutations will be clinically useful in diagnosis and carrier screening. Appropriate
Southern, northern and western blotting experiments
led to the suggestion that the majority of galactosemia
mutations would be of the missense type (Reichardt
1989). In fact, we recently reported the molecular
analysis of a classic galactosemia patient and characterized two missense mutations and two polymorphisms (Reichardt and Woo 1991). We found that the
two missense mutations affected evolutionarily conserved residues, while the polymorphisms affected

variable amino acids. Both mutations were found to
be rare. This led to two propositions: (a) that galactosemia is caused by a multiplicity of mutations and
(b) that this molecular heterogeneity is reflected in the
variable clinical outcome observed within the disorder. Therefore, we analyzed in molecular detail a patient with a well-defined phenotype. Our patient has
been characterized extensively (Lo et al. 1984) and,
despite documented adequate dietary management,
suffers from severe neurologic complications related
to his galactosemic condition. Such patients have been
recognized as a subpopulation among galactosemic
individuals (Lo et al. 1984; Boehles et al. 1986; Packman et al. 1987; Friedman et al. 1989).
Here we report two new galactosemia mutations
which were identified in an institutionalized patient
(Lo et al. 1984). Both mutations affect residues that
are highly conserved throughout evolution, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. The substitution of glutamine
188 by arginine occurs two amino acids downstream
from the proposed active site histidine-proline-histidine triad involved in the uridylate reaction intermediate. This mutation is relatively common; it was found
on one-fourth of the galactosemia alleles we studied.
The mutation of arginine 333 to tryptophan disrupts
the most highly conserved domain between human
GALT, yeast GAL7, and Escherichia coli galT. This
second mutation was found only in the patient we
sequenced. These data further support the proposition
that the variability observed in the clinical outcome of
galactosemia is the result of molecular heterogeneity.
Material and Methods

Cell Culture

Lymphocytes from patient JP (Lo et al. 1984) and
his mother were purified on Ficoll-Paque gradients
(Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) and then were transformed as described elsewhere (Reichardt and Woo
1991) to yield lines JR102 and JR103, respectively.
Lymphoblastoid cells from the father (GM10402)
were obtained from the NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). Lymphoblastoid
cells were grown to late log phase in RPMI1640
(GIBCO, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 5%
bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Cells used in
the ASO screening have been described elsewhere (Reichardt and Woo, in press), and additional samples
were provided by Drs. Louis Elsas (Emory University,
Atlanta) and Joseph Friedman (Brown University,
Providence).

861
Sequence Analysis
mRNA prepared from cells of interest was reversetranscribed into total cDNA and was PCR amplified
using published procedures (Reichardt and Woo
1991). Double-stranded template was sequenced with
Sequenase 2.0 (USB, Cleveland) as described elsewhere (Reichardt and Woo 1991), except that sometimes (a) dITP was used and (b) the dideoxy termination reactions were extended to 15 min.
ASO Hybridization
cDNA from normal and galactosemic cells was
hybridized to allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASO;
19mers, synthesized by Genosys, Houston) as described elsewhere (Reichardt and Woo 1991). The sequences of the normal/mutant ASO for the 188
mutation are CCCACTGCCa/gGTATGGGC, and
those for the 333 mutations are GCCACTGTCc/tGGAAATTCA (uppercase letters denote identical bases,
and lowercase letters denote variable bases). The uneven number of galactosemia alleles used in the present
study, 19, results from one Duarte/galactosemia com-

pound heterozygote.
Expression Analysis

Galactosemia mutations were reconstructed in uracil-containing pJR1 6 template by in vitro mutagenesis
using phosphorylated ASO as described elsewhere
(Reichardt and Woo 1991). Mutations were verified
by sequencing the relevant region on rescued singlestranded DNA. Plasmids were electroporated into cos
cells and were analyzed for GALT enzyme activity and
cross-reacting material (CRM) (Reichardt and Woo
1991).
Computer Analysis
Sequences were aligned using the Molecular Biology

Information Resource (MBIR) computational facility
at Baylor College of Medicine. Homology searches
used release 26.0 of the PIR data base. Sequences were
also searched for alteration of common restriction
sites by the MAP algorithm using the default enzyme
list which contained 122 different restriction endonucleases.
Results

To determine the molecular nature of the galactosemia mutation(s) present in cell line JR102, we
adopted a strategy that takes advantage of the fact that
all galactosemic patients characterized to date appear

862

to be mRNA+ and CRM+ (Reichardt 1989). In fact,
primary fibroblasts of the patient under investigation
were shown to have this profile (Reichardt 1989).
First, mRNA from cells of interest was reverse transcribed into total cDNA. Second, the entire coding
region of GALT was amplified by the PCR. Third,
double-stranded PCR products were then sequenced
directly with internal primers. Fourth, mutations were
confirmed biochemically by introducing the desired
nucleotide change, reconstructed by in vitro mutagenesis, into a mammalian expression vector. Fifth, after
transient expression of such mutant cDNAs in cos
cells, their GALT enzyme activity and their CRM were
determined. Sixth, kindred analysis was performed to
determine the inheritance of each mutation. Finally,
a population of normal and galactosemic cells was
screened to determine the frequency of each mutation
(Reichardt and Woo 1991).

Mutation Verification by Expression Analysis

Next we reconstructed each galactosemia mutation
by in vitro mutagenesis in the mammalian expression
phagemid pJR16 to yield pJR25 and pJR19, which
bear the arginine 188 and tryptophan 333, mutations
respectively. These constructs were introduced into
cos monkey cells by electroporation and were assayed
after transient expression. The Q188R mutation re-

Identification of Galactosemia Mutations
by Direct Sequencing
Direct sequencing of the PCR products obtained by
amplification from cell line JR102 revealed at nucleotide 591 an A-to-G transition which substitutes glutamine 188 by arginine (Q188R; fig. 1A). Furthermore,
we identified, at nucleotide 1025, a second transition,
C to T, which leads to the replacement of arginine 333
by tryptophan (R333W; fig. 1B). Finally, we noted an
A-to-T transversion at position 358 on one allele of
our patient. This mutation would not alter the amino
acid sequence of GALT, since it is a silent, thirdbasepair substitution in glycine codon 110.
Using the MAP program, we searched for restriction-site alterations caused by each mutation in
the GALT cDNA. The Q1 88R galactosemia mutation
would result in the loss of an EcoRII recognition site
and in the appearance of a novel HpaII site. The
R333W mutation would abolish an HpaII site, and
the silent, third-basepair change at position 358 would
not alter the recognition sequence of any commonly
used restriction enzymes.
Mendelian Transmission of Galactosemia Mutations

We examined the inheritance of the Q188R and
R333W galactosemia mutations by hybridization of
ASO to cDNA from both parents and the patient. The
Q1 88R mutation was inherited from the mother (fig.
2A), while the R333W mutation was paternally inherited (fig. 2B). This experiment proves that both parents are carriers for the two mutations we identified

mutation appears to seriously compromise the enzymatic properties of GALT. However, since we are
assaying human GALT from our expression phagemid
above the endogenous monkey enzyme, it is possible
that the R333W mutation also results in low enzymatic activity which we are unable to measure.

sulted in GALT activity reduced to about 10% of the
control value in normal cDNA (table 1, experiment
1). It is noteworthy that the Q188R mutation results
in normal levels of immunoreactive protein. Thus, this
mutation alters the catalytic properties of GALT but
not the protein's stability. The second mutation, the
tryptophan 333 substitution, resulted in undetectable
enzymatic activity. Normal amounts of full-length
protein were again synthesized in our system (table 1,
experiment 2). Therefore, the R333W galactosemia

The frequency of each galactosemia mutation was
determined by ASO hybridization to cDNA from 10
normal, 19 galactosemic, and one Duarte allele. One
of our cell lines is derived from a Duarte/ galactosemia
compound heterozygote, resulting in an uneven number of mutant alleles. Our galactosemic sample is
drawn from different geographic areas of the United
States and represents two racial backgrounds (Reichardt and Woo 1991). The Q1 88R mutation was not
detected either on normal alleles or on our Duarte
allele; however, it was present on five of the 19 galactosemic alleles tested (table 2). In fact, one patient was
homozygous for this galactosemia mutation, suggesting that this mutation is relatively common. In
contrast, the R333W mutation was detected on only
one allele of the patient we sequenced and was detected
on no normal or Duarte alleles. Thus, this mutation
appears to occur at a low frequency (table 2).

present paper highlight highly conserved domains of
the GALT enzyme which are probably important for
function. In fact, the Q188R mutation occurs two
amino acids downstream from the active site histidine-proline-histidine triad (Reichardt and Berg 1988;
Field et al. 1989). Searches of the PIR protein data

Discussion

1986), GAL7 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Tajimaa et al. 1985), and GALT from humans (Flach et
al. 1990) have been reported. The overall amino acid
sequence identity of GALT from these three distantly
related organisms is only about 35% (Flach et al.
1990). Therefore, we aligned the protein sequences
surrounding each mutation (fig. 3). It is striking that
the R333W mutation occurs in the longest stretch of
contiguous sequence identity between E. coli galT and
human GALT and that this region is interrupted only
by a conservative methionine-to-leucine substitution
in yeast. Homology across the region surrounding the
Q1 88R mutation is 71%, and this mutation contains
two more residues that are identical in both eukaryotes - i.e., S. cerevisiae and humans - as well as a conservative substitution (valine 189 to either isoleucine

At present, the molecular basis of galactosemia is
only poorly understood. A thorough molecular analysis of this disorder might lead to insights into some of
the chronic complications such as neurologic abnormalities and ovarian failure in treated individuals. Furthermore, the molecular definitions of mutations
could be useful for carrier screening. Finally, galactosemia mutations might highlight functionally important domains of the GALT enzyme.
Southern, northern, and western blotting experiments had led to the proposition that the majority of
galactosemia mutations would be of the missense type
(Reichardt 1989). In fact, we recently reported the
characterization of two galactosemia missense mutations and two GALT polymorphisms (Reichardt and
Woo 1991). Both galactosemia mutations occurred

Q188R and R333W mutations affecting highly conserved domains in GALT. The proposed active-site residues (Reichardt
Figure 3
and Berg 1988) are marked above the protein. The alignments of Escherichia coli galT, yeast GAL7, and human GALT for the relevant
domains are also shown. Boldface underlined residues are identical in all three organisms, while residues in capital letters are conserved
in two organisms only. The overall amino acid sequence identity between human, yeast, and E. coli GALT is only about 35% (Flach et
al. 1990).

Galactosemia Mutations
in conserved regions of the protein and were rare,
suggesting that galactosemia is caused by a multiplicity of mutations. The two polymorphisms affected
variable residues. To test those propositions, we analyzed in molecular detail a severely affected galactosemia patient (Lo et al. 1984). In the study reported
here, we characterized two mutations in highly conserved GALT domains.
We have four lines of evidence to prove that we have
identified two novel galactosemia mutations. First, direct sequencing of the entire PCR-amplified cDNA revealed only two mutations: (a) substitution of glutamine 188 by arginine (fig. 1A) and (b) replacement of
arginine 333 by tryptophan (fig. 1B). Both mutations
are the result of transitions. Second, kindred analysis
showed that the Q1 88R mutation was passed from the
mother whereas the R333W mutation was paternally
inherited (fig. 2). Third, biochemical analysis demonstrated that the Q1 88R mutation has substantial residual enzymatic activity (about 10% of normal; table
1). In contrast, the R333W mutation resulted in undetectable GALT activity (table 1). However, since the
assay is performed in cos cells, only increases above
the level of the endogenous monkey enzyme can be
measured. Therefore, the enzymatic activities for the
two mutants are only approximations. Finally, ASO
hybridization of our population detected the arginine
188 mutation in 0/10 normal alleles, in 0/1 Duarte
allele, and in 5/19 galactosemia alleles (table 2).
Thus, the Q188R mutation accounts for 26% of our
galactosemic sample and is the most common galactosemia mutation characterized to date. In contrast,
the R333W mutation was found in only the patient
we sequenced. These observations further support the
hypothesis that galactosemia is caused by a multiplicity of mutations, which might account for the heterogeneous clinical outcome observed in this disorder.
The R333W mutation is severe and might predispose
the patient we sequenced to his poor outcome despite
documented adequate dietary management (Lo et al.
1984).
We report here the molecular characterization of
two galactosemia mutations resulting in either 10%
or 0% of normal GALT activity in our cos cell system
(table 1). Thus, one might predict that in a compound
heterozygote for the Q188R and R333W (such as our
patient), 5% of normal activity would be found. In
fact, when cultured cells were assayed from this patient 4.1 % of normal enzyme activity was measured
(Reichardt 1989), suggesting that our reconstruction
and expression experiments in cos cells reflect the in

865

vivo situation. These data are in agreement with classic experiments that demonstrated 1.5%-4.9% of
normal activity in three galactosemic cell strains (Russell and DeMars 1967). These values are somewhat
higher than those generally reported for galactosemic
hemolysates (Segal 1989). However, comparison of
measurements in cultured cells with those obtained
from red blood cells may not be entirely valid, since
the latter are incapable of protein synthesis but can
degrade intracellular proteins. Furthermore, residual
GALT activity has been observed in three tissues from
galactosemic patients: intestinal mucosa (Rogers et al.
1970), liver (Segal et al. 1971), and reticulocytes (Kelley et al. 1989). Thus, measurements in cells or tissues
with protein synthetic capability will assay the activity
of both newly synthesized and aged enzymes, while in
erythrocytes only enzyme molecules in various stages
of degradation are measured.
We note that the R333W mutation occurs at a CpG
dinucleotide, the most common site for mutations in
humans (Cooper and Youssouffian 1988). Curiously,
the Q1 88R galactosemia mutation creates a new CpG
dinucleotide.
The silent third base change at nucleotide 358 is
potentially interesting, since no RFLPs have been reported for GALT. Unfortunately, it does not alter the
recognition site of any of the commonly used restriction enzymes in the cDNA. However, such silent substitutions might be useful in defining RFLPs in the
future.
Figure 3 shows the protein sequence alignments for
the homologous enzymes human GALT (Flach et al.
1990), yeast GAL7 (Tajima et al. 1985), and Escherichia coli galT (Lemaire and Mueller-Hill 1986).
These three organisms are representatives of such diverse groups as mammals, unicellular eukaryotes, and
prokaryotes. Furthermore, the overall amino acid
identity across these three proteins is only about 35%
(Flach et al. 1990). However, both galactosemia mutations reported in the present paper affect highly conserved domains (fig. 3). The Q1 88R mutation affects
a conserved glutamine two amino acids downstream
from the active site histidine-proline-histidine triad
(Reichardt and Berg 1988, Field et al. 1989). One of
these two histidines is thought to be the active-site
nucleophile involved in the formation of the uridylate
intermediate of the GALT reaction. The introduction
of a charged residue close to the active site is certain
to have effects on the catalytic properties of the GALT
enzyme. In fact, the arginine 188 mutation results in
low enzymatic activity (table 1). The R333W muta-

Reichardt et al.

866

tion occurs in the longest stretch of contiguous primary amino acid sequence identity between human
GALT and E. coli galT. Furthermore, among the 16
amino acid residues shown in figure 3 there is only one
conservative amino acid substitution (methionine to
leucine) between human GALT and yeast GAL7. At
present, the function of this domain is unknown, and
protein data base searches were uninformative. However, this highly conserved domain has to be important
for the enzyme's function, given its high degree of conservation and since the tryptophan 333 mutant results
in undetectable GALT activity. Therefore, we report
in the present paper two galactosemia mutations,
Q1 88R and R333W, that affect highly conserved domains of human GALT. These two domains probably
highlight portions of the molecule that are important
for its function.
It is striking that the four galactosemia mutations
characterized to date are missense mutations with a
CRM+ profile (see Reichardt and Woo 1991). Furthermore, each patient that was genotyped has at least
one allele with readily detectable residual GALT activity. It is possible that fractional enzymatic activity is
required in GALT, since it is a ubiquitously expressed
housekeeping enzyme. Loss of function on both
GALT alleles might not be compatible with life. In
fact, GALT may be required to supply a minimal
amount of UDP-Gal, one of the reaction products of
GALT, to galactosylate glycoproteins and glycolipids.
Recently, a reduction in the level of cellular UDPgalactose (UDP-Gal) has been reported in managed
galactosemic patients (Ng et al. 1989). Furthermore,
reduced galactosylation has been reported for galactosemic fibroblasts (Dobbie et al. 1990). Finally, reduction of galactolipids that is accompanied by an
increase of precursors to galactosylation reactions has
been observed recently in galactosemic brain and lymphocytes (Petry et al. in press). It seems reasonable
that residual GALT activity in galactosemic patients
is necessary to synthesize sufficient UDP-Gal to allow
minimal galactosylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids necessary for life.
In summary, we present here the molecular characterization of two severe galactosemia mutations. One
of these mutations, the Q1 88R mutation, appears to
be relatively common among galactosemia patients, a
fact which may be useful for screening purposes. Both
mutations affect highly conserved domains of the
GALT protein and thereby highlight functionally important domains. Finally, it appears that galactosemia

is caused by several mutations, which might explain
the heterozygous clinical outcome for this disorder.
