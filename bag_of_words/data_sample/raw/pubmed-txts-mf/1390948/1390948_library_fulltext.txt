fl-hexosaminidase A (fl-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase, EC 3.2.1.52) is a lysosomai hydrolase composed of an a- and a/3-subunit. It
is responsible for the degradation of GM2 ganglioside. Mutations in the HEXB gene encoded fl-subunit cause a form of GM2
gangliosidosis known as Sandhoff disease. Although this is a rare disease in the general population, several geographically
isolated groups have a high carrier frequency. Most notably, a 1 in 16-29 carrier frequency has been reported for an Argentinean
population living in an area contained within a 375-km radius from C6rdoba. Analysis of the genomic DNA of two patients from
this region revealed that one was homozygous for a G to A substitution at the 5' donor splice site of intron 2. This mutation
completely abolishes normal mRNA splicing. The other patient was a compound of the intron 2 G -~ A substitution and a second
allele due to a 4-bp deletion in exon 7. The fl-subunit mRNA of this allele is unstable, presumably as a result of an early stop
codon introduced by the deletion. Two novel PCR-based assays were developed to detect these mutations. We suggest that one
of these assays could be modified and used as a rapid screening procedure for 5' donor splice site defects in other genes. These
results provide a further example of the genetic heterogeneity that can exist even in a small geographically isolated population.

Introduction
There are two major isoenzymes of hexosaminidase
found in normal human tissue, fl-hexosaminidase A
(aF3) and fl-hexosaminidase B (fl/3). The a- and flsubunits are encoded by the evolutionarily related
HEXA and H E X B genes located on chromosome 15
and 5, respectively (reviewed in Ref. 1). Although the
biochemical characteristics of the two major isozymes
are similar, only the hexosaminidase A heterodimer is
capable of binding the GM2 activator/GM2 ganglioside
complex and hydrolyzing GM2 to GM3 ganglioside. Mutations that prevent the formation of functional hexosaminidase A or the GM2 activator protein cause the
lysosomal storage of GM2 ganglioside and the neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as the GM2
gangliosidoses (reviewed in Ref. 2). Thus, the three
forms of GM2 gangliosidosis are Tay-Sachs disease
(genetic deficiency of the a-subunit), Sandhoff disease

(defect in the common/3-subunit) and AB-variant form
of GM2 gangliosidosis (activator gene mutations).
Patients with Sandhoff disease display a wide spectrum of clinical severity. The severity of the phenotype
may relate to the amount of residual hexosaminidase A
activity present in patient samples [3]. The most severe
infantile form ( < 0.5% residual hexosaminidase A activity), is a rapidly fatal and predominantly neurological
disorder of infants. The later onset forms (0.5-10%
residual hexosaminidase A activity) are less severe,
with the affected patients showing the first signs of the
disease later in life (reviewed in Ref. 2).
To date, whereas a large number of H E X A gene
mutations have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 4),
only a few H E X B mutations have been described. A
common mutation in the H E X B gene, accounting for
27% of known Sandhoff alleles, is a deletion of exons
1-5 by recombination at flanking Alu sequences [5].
This mutation is probably the same as that described
by Bikker et al. using pluse-field gel electrophoresis [6].
In another report we demonstrated that an infantileonset patient possesses two rare mutant alleles containing either a 1 or 2-bp deletion [7]. Two other rare
mutations have been identified that create new splice

sites in the gene. These give rise to different levels of
residual hexosaminidasc A activity produced from low
levels of properly spliced /3-subunit-mRNA. One, a
G ~ A transition in intron 12 ( 3 - 6 % residual activity),
was associated with the milder juvenile onset Sandhoff
disease, while the other, an 18-bp duplication at the
intron 13/exon 14 junction (9-10% residual activity),
resulted in an asymptomatic state [8-10].
Recently, a Japanese patient with juvenile Sandhoff
phenotype was shown to be homozygous for a C--+ T
transition located 8 nucleotides downstream from the
intron 10/exon 11 junction. Surprisingly, the effect of
this mutation is to inhibit p r o p e r / 3 - m R N A splicing. A
small amount of normally spliced /3-mRNA accounting
for the residual hexosaminidase A activity (8%), was
detected in the patient's ceils [11]. We have also described a 57-year-old patient with a very mild phenotype, not usually associated with Sandhoff disease [12].
Interestingly, we found that this individual is a genetic
compound of the infantile 5' deletion mutation [5] and
the juvenile intron 10/exon 11 C - + T mutation [11].
The variable phenotype associated with the intron
10/exon 11 C---,T transition indicates that other
unidentified factors determine the pathological outcome of this mutation. We speculated that the severity
of the effect of the mutation on the levels of properly
spliced /3-mRNA may be determined by individual
variations in the RNA splicing machinery [ 12].
Unlike infantile Tay-Sachs disease, which has a high
carrier frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish and French
Canadian populations, Sandhoff disease is not enriched in any ethnic group. However, several geographic isolates or demes have been identified with
high incidence of this disease, including an inbred
community of Metis Indians (a mixture of French
and North American Indian heritage) in northern
Saskatchewan {13]. Most notably, 53 cases of Sandhoff
disease were diagnosed in 32 Argentinean families over
a 14-year period. Most of these families traced their
ancestry to a geographically isolated area encompassing the northwestern region of the province of C6rdoba
and the central southern region of the province of La

Roija in Argentina [14]. The carrier frequency m this
region has been calculated to be 1 in every. 16 2~;
inhabitants [15], making Sandhoff disease a significam
genetic disorder in this deme. Since the expected occurrence of the disease in the general population is
1:300000 births [2], the presence of a high frequency
of H E X B gene mutation(s) would be expected in this
population.
The clinical features in all of the Argentinean Sandhoff patients are consistent with the severe infantile
phenotype, with diagnosis made by 6 months and death
occurring by 2 years of age. Serum enzymatic studies
using fluorogenic and chromogenic derivatives failed to
detect any residual hexosaminidase A or B activity in
these patients [14]. The identification of t f E X B genc
mutations responsible for infantile Sandhoff disease in
this Argentinean deme, which we describe in this report, is a prerequisite for the future development of
DNA-based carrier screening procedures and prenatal
diagnosis.
Materials and Methods

Fibroblast cell lines 1954, 2182 and 2187 were established from skin biopsies obtained from two unrelated
Argentinean patients and one obligate carrier, respectively. There have been no consanguineous marriages
within either patient's family for at least three generations. Cell line GM203 was obtained from the Human
Genetic Mutant Cell Line Repository, Camden, NJ.
Lines 2010 and 2012 were supplied by M. Kaback,
U.C.L.A. Line WG534 was from the Cell Repository of
Neuromuscular Disease, McGill University, Montreal.
Canada and lines 322, 1146, 1279 and 1303 were established in our laboratory from patients diagnosed with
Sandhoff disease by standard hexosaminidase assays of
serum and leukocytes. The cell lines were maintained
and propagated in a - M E M media supplemented with
100 Izg each streptomycin and penicillin and 10% fetal
bovine serum at 37°C in 5% CO 2. Genomic DNA was
isolated as described previously [16].

RNA purification. Total-RNA was isolated from fibroblast cultures by the guanidinium-isothiocyanate
method followed by CsCI centrifugation [17]. Integrity
and abundance of the isolated total-RNA were checked
by electrophoresis and by determination of the 260/280
absorbance ratio.
Northern blot analysis. Northern blot analysis was
performed as previously described [18]. The probe utilized to visualize the hexosaminidase B transcript was a
500-bp segment from pHexB43 [19] containing exons
2-7 randomly primed with 50 /zCi [a-32p]dCTP. Hybridization was performed for 24 h at 42°C with 50/zl
of a 6" 108 cpm/ml labelled probe. The filter was
washed in 2 x SSC/0.1% SDS at 37°C for 30 min and
then incubated at 65°C for 10 min in the same solution
followed by exposure to XAR-5 Kodak film at -70°C.
The mRNA lengths were estimated by comparison
with migration standards (0.16-1.77 kb RNA ladder
and 0.24-9.5 kb RNA ladder, Bethesda Research Laboratories).
DNA amplification. The mutant alleles in Sandhoff
cell lines were examined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure. Table I summarizes the oligonucleotides utilized for DNA amplification and sequencing in this study. Sheared genomic DNA isolated
from the cultured fibroblasts was used as the initial
template. The PCR fragment whose sequence included
the intron-2 splice-junction mutation was detected using primer A in intron 1 and primer B in intron 2
(Table I). The amplifications were done in 100 /J,l
reactions containing 0.5/xg sheared genomic DNA, 10
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCI 2, 1
mM of each dNTP, 0.01% gelatin, 0.8 /zM of each
primer and 1.5 U of Taq polymerase (Cetus/PerkinElmer, Norwalk, CT). The reactions were run in a
Cetus/Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler for 30 cycles,
each consisting of denaturation at 94°C for 0.5 min,
annealing at 55°C for 0.5 min and extension at 72°C for
1.5 min. Following amplification, 1/10 of each sample
was electrophoresed in a 0.7% agarose gel and stained
with ethidium bromide to assay for reaction specificity
and yield. The PCR fragment containing the exon-7
deletion mutation was produced using primer D and
primer E (Table I). The reaction conditions utilized
were as described above with the addition of 1 U
Perfect Match (Stratagene) to each amplification reaction mixture.
cDNA synthesis and amplification. Primer F (0.5/zg,
Table I) complementary to hexosaminidase B mRNA,
was annealed to 15/xg total fibroblast RNA from cell
lines 1954 and 2182 for 1 h at 42°C in 30 /zl buffer
containing 25/zl 1 × reverse transcriptase buffer [18], 2
/zl (70U) RNAguard (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology)
and 3 t~l (7.5 U) of AMV reverse transcriptase (Bethesda Research Laboratories). Half of the cDNA
product was subjected to PCR, for second strand syn-

thesis and amplification/using the conditions described
above, utilizing 0.5/zg of exon 2 (forward) and exon 9
(reverse)-specific primers (Table I). The amplified
products were analyzed on a 0.7% agarose gel.
DNA Sequencing. Agarose-gel purified DNA
amplification products were sequenced directly utilizing a modified version of the Sanger dideoxy chaintermination method [20,21].
Assay for the splice-junction defect allele. Sheared
genomic DNA derived from cultured fibroblasts was
used as the initial template in the polymerase chain
reaction to amplify the region containing the mutation
at the 5' donor splice site of intron 2. The reaction was
carried out in 30 cycles, as described above, using
primers A in intron 1 and C in intron 2. Primer C
containing a mismatch (underlined in Table 1) creates
a MaelII site in DNA amplified from normal alleles.
The amplified DNA from alleles containing the G ~ A
splice-junction mutation, however, do not create this
additional MaelII site. The PCR products were digested with 2 U of MaelII at 55°C for 90 min and
analyzed by electrophoresis in an agarose (3% NuSieve,
FMC) minigel.
Assay for the exon-7 deletion allele. Sheared genomic
DNA (0.5 /~g) from cultured fibroblasts was used as
the initial template to amplify the segment of exon 7
containing the 4-bp deletion. The reaction was carried
out using the primers and conditions described above
and the amplification products electrophoresed on an
8% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad Mini Gel system,
l-ram thickness) to detect heteroduplex formation. The
gel was soaked in an ethidium bromide solution (1
/zg/ml) to visualize the DNA. Alternatively, the amplified DNA was digested with 2/zl (12 U) of XmnI (New
England Biolabs) for 2 h at 37°C prior to 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
Results

The genomic DNA from Argentinean infantile
Sandhoff cell lines 1954 and 2182 have both been
shown previously to have no major HEXB gene deletions or rearrangements by Southern analysis [22].
Northern blot analysis was used to assess the effect of
the mutation(s) on the /3-subunit-mRNA produced by
these cell lines. In addition, the/3-subunit-mRNA from
obligate carrier cell line, 2187 (mother of 2182) was
examined. As shown in Fig. 1, /3-subunit-mRNA of
apparently normal size, 2.2 kb, and amount was clearly
detectable in both the normal fibroblasts and in the
carrier cell line 2187. However, both infantile Sandhoff
lines contained undetectable steady-state levels of /3subunit-mRNA. Due to the apparent instability of the
mRNA obtained from the two patient cell lines, we
hypothesized that a subtle defect would be found at a

Sandhoff fibroblasts. 20 # g of total R N A from normal fibroblasts

splice junction or in an exon, producing an early stop
codon.
A point mutation was identified by comparing the
nucleotide sequence of the entire coding sequence and
all i n t r o n / e x o n junctions from the H E X B gene of
fibroblasts from the three Sandhoff patients with that
from a normal control. The H E X B gene sequence
obtained from the Argentinean patients (lines 1954
and 2182) and the obligate carrier (line 2187) contained a G ~ A substitution at the 5' donor splice site
of intron 2 (Fig. 2). Patient 1954 was found to be

homozygous for the splice-junction defect, while 2182
and 2187 were found to be heterozygous for this mut~ltion.
To determine if a small amount of properly spliced
/3-subunit m R N A (undetectable by Northern blot analysis) was present in cell line 1954, m R N A was isolated,
reverse transcribed and exons 2 - 9 amplified by the
PCR. Whereas the expected length of the e D N A is 825
bp, e D N A products of a variety of sizes were produced
by cell line 1954, the largest band of which was approx.
600 bp (data not shown). Attempts to sequence any of
these c D N A products indicated each apparent band
contained a heterogeneous population of DNA fragments. Thus, as would be expected from the patient's
infantile phenotype, this splice-junction mutation precludes the formation of any normal /3-subunit m R N A
which in turn results in the absence of residual hexosaminidase A (or B) activity.
The heterozygosity of the D N A from cell line 2182
indicates that more than one mutant H E X B allele is
present in this small Argentinean population. Further
sequence analysis of genomic D N A from patient 2182
revealed a 4-bp deletion (5'-CTTT-3', nucleotides 784787) in exon 7 of the second allele (Fig. 3). This
mutation causes a shift in the reading frame which
results in a stop codon being generated 35 bp from the
deletion.
We next developed simple, nonradioactive assays to
screen for each of the two mutations identified above.
The G ~ A substitution at the donor splice site of
intron 2 did not create or abolish a restriction site.
Therefore, we designed an oligonucleotide primer that
contained a single bp mismatch to create a Maelll site
in the PCR product from normal alleles. This strategy
is schematically represented in Fig. 4. After MaeIll
digestion the normal allele produced a 212-bp fragment; however, due to the G--* A transition in the
mutant allele the additional MaeIII site is not formed,

Argentinean population. Interestingly, an additional
mutant allele was detected by MaeIII digestion in cell
line 2012, established from an infantile Sandhoff patient of E u r o p e a n origin (Fig. 5). However, sequence
analysis revealed that this patient was heterozygous for
a G ~ C rather than the Argentinean G --* A transition
at the intron 2 donor splice site (data not shown).
In order to develop a simple diagnostic test for
carriers of the 4-bp deletion in exon 7, we assayed for
the anomalous migration of heteroduplexes formed
between two homologous P C R fragments, one of which
contains a small insertion or deletion [23]. D N A from
our collection of Sandhoff cell lines was isolated, the
region of exon 7 containing the 4-bp deletion amplified
and the P C R fragments analyzed on a 8% polyacrylamide gel. The normal control D N A contains one band
at 280 bp, the expected size of the amplification product. T h e D N A from line 2182 also contained this band
and presumably also an indistinguishable band at 276
bp due to the 4-bp deletion. However, the presence of
the small deletion in one strand of a heteroduplex was
detectable by the appearance of two higher molecular
weight bands in the patient's D N A (Fig. 6).
Additionally, the 4-bp deletion in exon 7 destroys an
X m n I restriction site. Digestion of amplified normal
D N A with this enzyme gives two bands of 90 and 190

Discussion
In this study, we have identified two mutations
responsible for Sandhoff disease in two unrelated Argentinean patients, neither of which are reported to be
the offspring of consanguineous marriages. The first
mutation is a G ~ A substitution at the 5' donor splice
site of intron 2. While no c D N A fragment containing
the exon 2 / i n t r o n 2 junction of normal size could be
amplified by PCR from this mutant allele, a number of
smaller fragments were observed. These data indicate
that this donor splice junction is completely inactivated
by this 5' donor splice site mutation, which results in
the production of unstable aberrant m R N A species.
This splice-site mutation could be expected to result in
the accumulation of a transcript retaining all of intron
2, or a portion thereof, due to the presence of a cryptic
splice site within the intronic sequence. However, perhaps due to the large size of intron 2 (4.1 kb) these
products were not detected by the PCR protocol utilized. Thus, the c D N A products observed may represent only a small fraction of the misspliced products
resulting from this splice-junction defect.
The 5' donor site is generally of the form (C or
A ) A G / g t ( g or a)act (where G / g are the - 1 / + 1
positions) and the acceptor site is preceded by a stretch
of pyrimidines, having the form (Py)~xca_gg/G(G or T)
[24, 25]. Fortuitously, the recognition site of the restriction enzyme MaeIII ( G T N A C ) closely resembles the 5'
donor site consensus sequence, positions ~ 1 to ~ 5,
i.e., g-t-(g or a)-a-c. Thus, amplification of a D N A
segment containing a donor splice junction, followed
by MaeII1 digestion, should recognize any mutations in
this conserved region. However, in the case of the
H E X B gene 12 out of 13 donor splice sites possess a G
rather than a C in position + 5 of the consensus site
[26,27]. This problem can be overcome by amplifying
the donor splice region with an oligonucleotide containing the needed C at position + 5, thus, converting
this region in the amplification products to the Maelll
recognition site. This technique detected an unrelated
G ~ C transition at the intron 2 donor splice junction
in cell line 2012, raising the possibility of utilizing it to
screen for mutations at other 5' donor splice junctions
in the H E X B gene. Due to the conserved nature of 5'
donor sites among all eukaryotic genes, modifications
of this technique could make it applicable for the rapid

97
screening of other genes for similar splice junction
defects.
The second mutation we identified in this Argentinean deme, a 4-bp deletion in exon 7, creates a
premature stop codon 35 nucleotides from the deletion
site, resulting in the synthesis of an unstable mRNA.
Mutations which prematurely terminate translation are
known to affect m R N A metabolism. The two small
deletion mutations, in exon 7 or 11 of the mutant
H E X B alleles of an infantile-onset Sandhoff patient,
also create premature stop codons shortly after their
occurrence [7]. Levels of /3-mRNA were similarly undetectable by Northern blot analysis in ceils from this
patient [7]. Two frame-shift mutations resulting in premature stop codons have been identified in the H E X A
gene. One, a 4-bp insertion in exon 11 [28] results in
undetectable levels of a-chain mRNA, while the other,
a 1-bp deletion in exon 13 [29], does not [30]. These
data support the hypothesis that the instability of aand /3- m R N A containing premature stop codons is
caused by the loss of protection by ribosomes at their
3' ends, thereby increasing the mRNA's susceptibility
to endogenous RNase digestion, i.e., the length of their
3' untranslated end is inversely proportional to mRNA
stability.
The identification of two mutations in the Argentinean deme correlates with previous RFLP analysis of
the H E X B gene [31], which revealed a Pst I polymorphism that detects a simple two-allele polymorphism
with a band at either 1.6 or 1.0 kb. The scoring of 216
Caucasian individuals revealed the frequency of these
alleles to be 0.12 and 0.88, respectively. Patient 1954,
found to be homozygous for the G ~ A splicing defect,
is also homozygous for the minor 1.6-kb allele, while
2182, the compound heterozygote, was heterozygous
for the Pst polymorphism. These preliminary data suggest that this splice-junction defect is probably found in
association with the 1.6-kb minor allele in the Argentinean population.
Although our analyses were limited to four mutant
alleles, our data indicate that at least one of them, the
splice-junction mutation (3 out of 4 alleles), is at a high
frequency in the Argentinean population. Further mutant alleles must be examined in order to assess the
frequency of the 4-bp deletion. These data linking
m o r e than one mutant H E X B gene allele to Sandhoff
disease in this small Argentinean deme, may provide a
further example of a disease with a high carrier frequency in a particular ethnic group or geographic isolate, that is associated with more than one allele. This
situation is similar to the identification of two mutant
H E X A alleles responsible for Tay-Sachs disease among
Ashkenazi Jews [28,32]. Two theories have been proposed to explain the high frequency of Tay-Sachs disease among Ashkenazim, which could also be applied
to Sandhoff disease in this Argentinean population:

(1), The founder effect, followed by genetic drift [33]
and (2), selection in the form of heterozygote advantage [34]. The identification of two mutations in these
populations may suggest the latter.
