Summary. Hemophilia B is due to multiple molecular
defects in the factor IX gene. Over 80% of mutations are
single base substitutions. By amplification and direct
sequencing, 51 single base substitutions were found in
the transcribed sequence of the factor IX genes of patients
from 50 distinct families with hemophilia B. These include 30 mutations in 29 families not previously reported
by us; of these, 12 are novel, i.e., not previously published in other series. Of the 51 substitutions in our overall series 23 (45%) occurred as C-to-T or G-to-A transitions at 11 sites within C G dinucleotides. It is estimated
that CG transitions occur from one to two orders of magnitude more frequently than mutations in nucleotides
that are not within a C G pair. More than one family had
identical defects for 6 of the C G mutations. At 4 of these
sites, most patients had different haplotypes compatible
with distinct mutations. Non-CG-type mutations occurred thoughout the coding regions with only one mutation
in more than one family. The latter included 7 families
with a 397 Ile-to-Thr defect that all share a rare haplotype, suggesting a common ancestor.

Introduction
Mutations in the X-linked factor IX gene are responsible
for deficient factor IX activity in patients with hemophilia
B (Thompson 1991). Haldane (1935) proposed that each
hemophilic family with an affected m e m b e r would have
its own "private" variant. This was based on the X-linked
nature of the gene, the selective disadvantage of the
bleeding tendency in patients, the lack of a selective advantage in carriers and, therefore, elimination of new
mutations from populations in a few generations.

Genetic heterogeneity of hemophilia B is evident from
multiple molecular defects of the factor IX gene in different patients. Defects include distinct gene deletions,
insertions, and point mutations (Brownlee 1989; Thompson 1991). While gross gene deletions or insertions are
easily detected during routine Southern blot analyses of
patient's D N A , most point mutations and small nucleotide deletions (or insertions) can only be defined by D N A
sequencing. It appears that at least 80% of the mutations
in patients with hemophilia B are due to a variety of single
nucleotide substitutions throughout the transcribed sequence of the factor IX gene, and transitions within C G
dinucleotides account for about half of these (Green et
al. 1990; Koeberl et al. 1989; Zhang et al. 1989a).
When amplification by the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR; Saiki et al. 1988) is combined with direct D N A
sequencing, it is possible to define mutations at the sequence level, to determine origins of mutations, to search
for mutation "hot spots" in unrelated patients, and to
test the Haldane hypothesis directly. In this study, 51
distinct point mutations from a single series are reviewed,
including 30 not previously reported. Whereas CG dinucleotides represent point "hot spots," other point mutations occur throughout the transcribed sequences. Distinctly different occurrences of the same point mutation
have only been found as transitions within CG dinucleotides.

Materials and methods
Patient population and D N A samples
Blood samples were obtained from a series of patients with hemophilia B, including 41 families from the Pacific Northwest, representing about one-third of the identified families with affected
members in this area. There were also five samples from patients
in China (Wang et al. 1990a, b) and four referred from other parts
of the U.S. Seven additional patients have had mutations other

178
than point mutations defined and samples on an additional 15 patients have been partially sequenced without a defect being determined at this point. Blood (10-20 ml) samples were drawn into
heparin, ACD, or EDTA tubes from hemophilia B patients and
their family members. Citrated plasma was separated by centrifugation and tested for factor IX clotting activities and antigen levels
as described (Thompson 1977; Bray et al. 1986; Chen et al. 1989b).
Patients were classified according to their factor IX clotting activity levels and clinical bleeding tendencies as having severe (< 1
units/dl), moderate (1-5 units/dl) or mild (5-25 units/dl) hemophilia B. All patients with severe hemophilia also had a history of
relatively frequent, spontaneous bleeding episodes.

fragments 8 a or 8b, alternative primers were used for confirmation
of sequence. These oligonucleotide primer sequences were bases
30790-30809 (5'-TFGTGACTTAAAATGAAATT-3') for fragment 8a and bases 31025-31045 (5'TTTGGATCTGGCTATGT
AAGT-3') for fragment 8b.
Haplotype analyses were performed by immunoassays (Thr >
Ala-148, Thompson et al. 1988), PCR (intron 1 insertion, Bouvier
et al. 1990; BamHI, Zhang et al. 1989b; HhaI, Reiner and Thompson 1990), or Southern blotting (TaqI, Chen et al. 1985).

Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes as previously described (Chen et al. 1985). PCR was performed according to a
method described by Saiki et al. (1988) with minor modification
for amplification of factor IX gene fragments (Chen et al. 1989b).
Nine sets of primers (20-25 nucleotides each) were used to amplify
all coding regions, exon/intron junctions and the leader sequence
to nucleotide -66 of factor IX gene. The sequences and locations
of the primers are presented in Table 1. The nine amplified fragments total 2720bp of the factor IX gene sequence (excluding
overlap) and readily allow sequencing of all exons and splice junctions and a putative promotor region.

DNA sequencing
The amplified DNA fragments were further purified by electrophoresis on agarose and electroelution. They were then subjected
to direct sequencing by the dideoxy-nucleotide chain termination
method (Sanger et al. 1977). Amplification primers were used for
sequencing. For patients with defects in exon 8 near the 3' ends of

tron 1 insert present, TaqI negative and Thr-148, and
H h a I positive (as found in 8% of Caucasian factor IX
genes). Patients f r o m the four families with the 296.1
change (Thr-to-Met) were the same phenotype except
for being intron 1 insert absent and H h a I negative (as
found in 22% of Caucasian factor IX genes).
On all patients, D N A samples were screened by factor IX c D N A hybridization to Southern blots after separate digestion with TaqI, E c o R I and H i n d I I I (Chen et
al. 1985). T w o gross gene alterations were apparent on
Southern blots in different families (a partial deletion
and an insertion); two other partial deletions were first
noted by failure to amplify particular exons. A single
base deletion and a dinucleotide insertion have led to
frameshift mutations in patients from two other families.
Finally, a 4-bp deletion at a donor splice junction site
was found. These seven mutations (and the 50 patients
with point mutations) have been summarized (Thompson 1991). Overall, 50 of 57 patients (88% with defined
mutations have had point mutations.

Discussion
The overabundance of the point mutations at C G dinucleotides ( - 4 5 % ) agrees with published data for point
mutations in other series of patients with hemophilia B
(Koeberl et al. 1989; G r e e n et al. 1990). The mechanism
of mutation "hot spots" at C G dinucleotides appears to
involve methylation followed by spontaneous deamination of cytosine residues in C G sequences. These result
in C-to-T or G - t o - A transitions, the latter due to a C-toT substitution in the complimentary strand (Bird 1980).
Some multiple occurrences of mutations at the same
site can be documented to be independent events. For
the CG-type mutations, independent origins of the codon
333.1 (Arg to Stop) defect have been demonstrated by
de novo occurrence in three families (Koeberl et al.
1990a); the three patients in this series (two reported
previously) also have distinct haplotypes (A. R. T h o m p son and S.-H. Chen, unpublished). In addition, different
haplotypes of factor IX are associated in each of the three

families with the c o d o n 60.1 (Gly-to-Ser) defect. T h e
two patients each with the c o d o n s 233.1 (Ala-to-Thr)
and 333.2 ( A r g - t o - G l n ) defects had different ethnic and
geographic origins as well as distinct haplotypes. I n contrast, o u r patient with the 29.2 substitution ( A r g - t o - G l n ,
in Table 1) is likely related to a previously described patient (Koeberl et al. 1989) as both also have a silent, 227.3
transition (Table 1; B o t t e m a et al. 1989). This is in spite
of a negative family history in o u r patient. T h e three patients with the 248.2 ( A r g - t o - G l n ) and four patients with
296.1 (Thr-to-Met) changes c a n n o t be distinguished as
each have relatively f r e q u e n t patterns o n haplotyping,
and could be i n d e p e n d e n t m u t a t i o n s or m a y represent a
" f o u n d e r effect" as described below.
F o r n o n - C G mutations, the c o d o n 397.2 transition is
clearly an exception as it has b e e n detected patients f r o m
21 different families (Fig. 2). All seven of o u r patients
are Caucasians and have the same c o m m o n h a p l o t y p e ;
namely: intron 1 insert absent, Taql-, Mspl § X m n l - ,
Thr-148 § (MnlI-), and Hhal § O f g r e a t e r significance,
all share the u n c o m m o n ( a b o u t 3% incidence) BamHI §
allele ( T h o m p s o n et al. 1990). E l e v e n other patients with
this same defect also share the u n c o m m o n BamHI + allele ( B o t t e m a et al. 1990). It is thus likely that m o s t if
not all o f the patients having the c o d o n 397.2 m u t a t i o n
are p r o g e n y of a single ancestor w h o first h a d or carried
the mutation. T h e m u t a n t gene then dispersed t h r o u g h a
" f o u n d e r effect" in the population. T h e n o n - C G - t y p e
mutations are therefore largely multiple, distinct m u t a tion events, supporting H a l d a n e ' s (1935) hypothesis. Assuming the seven 397.2 substitutions represent a single
event, the C G - t y p e transitions represent 49% of the total
point m u t a t i o n s in the Seattle series; the p e r c e n t a g e
could be as low as 43% if all of the 248.1 and 296.1 C G
transitions were each due to a single m u t a t i o n event.
G r e e n et al. (1990) states that a c o m p a r a b l e 53% of the
i n d e p e n d e n t point mutations are C G transitions in their
series.
Figure 2 shows f r e q u e n c y o f occurrences of k n o w n
point m u t a t i o n s as C G transitions (C-to-T or G - t o - A )
c o m p a r e d to n o n - C G - t y p e substitutions within o t h e r codons of factor IX, as based u p o n a recent review ( T h o m p son 1990). In this review, 50% of 197 distinct families
with point mutations in the transcribed s e q u e n c e were
due to mutations located within C G dinucleotides. Assuming that all o f the c o d o n 397.2 families w e r e due to a
single point m u t a t i o n ( T h o m p s o n et al. 1990; B o t t e m a et

A s s u m i n g 80% o f the hemophilic defects are nucleotide substitutions and that the m u t a t i o n rate for h e m o philia B is a b o u t 3 • 10 -6 (Bitter 1964), then the point
m u t a t i o n rate for a C or G within o n e of the C G dinucleotides in the coding region of the gene is:
(3 X 10 -6) (0.8)(0.45)
31

= 3.5 • 10 -8

w h e r e 0.45 is the ratio of transitional mutations in C G
dinucleotides to the total n u m b e r of point mutations,
and 31 is the n u m b e r of C and G nucleotides in C G s in
the coding regions of the gene w h e r e a transition would
c h a n g e the code. T h e calculated m u t a t i o n rate of a single

C or G nucleotide in the coding region is 3.5 • 10 -8,
which is at least one to two orders o f m a g n i t u d e greater
than the estimate o f 10 -9 to 10 -1~ for a single nucleotide
m u t a t i o n rate in general (Vogel and M o t u l s k y 1986).

Note added in proof. Since submission of this manuscript an extended series of mutations in patients studied at the Mayo Clinic
has appeared with a similar calculation of mutation rates (Koeberl
et al. 1990b). They also observed patients with the 216.2 (Ile-toThr) and 307.2 (Val-to-Ala) mutations; where tested, our patients'
haplotypes were the same: intron 1 insert present, TaqI negative
and Thr-148 in the former (HhaI was also positive in our patient),
and intron 1 insert absent, TaqI positive and Ala-148 in the latter
(HhaI was also negative in our patient). In addition, a data base of
factor IX mutations has been published (Giannelli et al. 1990).
Within this catalog, the 211.1 mutation (Val-to-Phe) has also been
found in an unpublished series from Germany; details on this patient will be of interest.
