familial hypercholesterolemia that affects ligand binding and

ABSTRACT
The coding region of the low density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor gene from a patient (MM) with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) has been sequenced
from six overlapping 500-base-pair amplified fragments of the
cDNA from cultured skin fibroblasts. Two separate single
nucleotide base changes from the normal sequence were detected. The first involved substitution of guanine for adenine in
the third position of the codon for amino acid residue Cys-27
and did not affect the protein sequence. The second mutation
was substitution of thymine for cytosine in the DNA for the
codon for amino acid residue 664, changing the codon from
CCG (proline) to CTG (leucine) and introducing a new site for
the restriction enzyme Pst I. MM is a true homozygote with two
identical genes, and the mutation cosegregated with clinically
diagnosed FH in his family in which rwst cousin marriages
occurred frequently. The amino acid change occurs in the
center of growth factor repeat C in the epidermal growth factor
precursor-homology domain of the protein, a region of highly
conserved sequence between bovine and human LDL receptors, and results in slowed, but complete, maturation of the
precursor to the mature form of the receptor and, despite its
remoteness from the ligand-binding domain, in impaired binding of LDL. LDL receptors in MM's skin fibroblasts bind less
LDL than normal and with reduced affinity. Thus this naturally occurring single point mutation affects both intracellular
transport of the protein and ligand binding and occurs in
growth factor-like repeat C, a region that has not previously
been found to influence LDL binding.

cholesterolemia (FH) and of constructed mutations has shed
some light on the function of these different domains in the
process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. The first NH2terminal 292 residues of the LDL receptor comprise the
ligand-binding domain, containing seven cysteine-rich 40amino acid repeats. Mutations in this domain can affect
intracellular transport (5, 6) as well as ligand binding (7-9).
The next adjacent domain comprises 400 amino acid residues
with 35% homology with the epidermal growth factor (EGF)
precursor (10). Within this domain are three cysteine-rich
repetitive elements (A, B, and C) termed "growth factor-like
repeats" (11), which are found in many cell-surface and
secreted proteins. Mutational analysis has shown that repeat
A, but not B, is required for binding of LDL (9), whereas
other mutations in repeats A and B affect recycling of
receptors (12). Deletion of the entire domain affects the
ability of the receptor protein on the cell surface to bind LDL
but has no effect on binding ofligands by the purified receptor
on a nitrocellulose blot (12). Mutations in the EGF-precursor
homology domain have also been found to prevent the
maturation of the precursor protein (9), which is rapidly
degraded and fails to reach the cell surface.
We have recently described the properties of the LDLreceptor protein in cultured skin fibroblasts from a FH
subject (MM) in whom there is both impaired transport of the
newly synthesized protein to the cell surface and impaired
binding of LDL (13). In this paper, we have determined the
sequence of the coding region of the LDL-receptor gene in
MM, who is a true homozygote with identical defective
genes, and show that the malfunctions are due to a single
point mutation that changes proline 664 in growth factor-like
repeat C to leucine.

The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is a cell-surface
protein that mediates the specific recognition, uptake, and
degradation of plasma LDL. During receptor-mediated endocytosis, LDL receptors on the cell surface cluster into
coated pits that internalize to form endocytic vesicles from
which the receptor recycles to the cell surface, while the
ligand is degraded in lysosomes (1). The LDL receptor is
synthesized as a precursor protein, of apparent molecular
weight 120,000 by gel electrophoresis, and undergoes considerable posttranslational modification by the addition and
remodeling of both 0-linked and N-linked carbohydrate
chains before it reaches the cell surface as a mature protein
of apparent molecular weight 160,000 (2).
From cDNA cloning of LDL-receptor mRNA (3) and from
the intron-exon structure of the gene (4) it has been predicted
that the LDL receptor is an integral membrane protein of 839
amino acid residues that comprises a mosaic of several
different domains. Analysis of naturally occurring mutations
in the LDL receptor gene in patients with familial hyper-

in medium containing 10% (vol/vol) lipoprotein-deficient
serum as described (16).
Gene Amplification. Double-stranded cDNA for the LDLreceptor mRNA was synthesized with a "cDNA synthesis
system plus" kit (Amersham), using the protocol described in
the kit for 1 gg of poly(A)-rich RNA, with the exceptions that
5-10 Ag of total cytoplasmic RNA was substituted for
poly(A)-rich RNA, and a 21-nucleotide oligomer complementary to bases 2609-2577 of the LDL-receptor mRNA was
substituted for the primer(s) in the kit, to give a concentration
of 50 Ag/ml in the first-strand reaction. Based on the incorporation of dCT32P, the yield of cDNA was :20 ng. For
amplification (17), a Gene Amp DNA amplification kit was
used (Perkin-Elmer/Cetus). The reaction mix (final volume,
100 ul) contained -2 ng of cDNA and two 21-nucleotide
oligomers that delineated 0.5-kilobase (kb) fragments of the
coding region (3, 4), to give a final concentration of 5 Ag/ml
each. The 5' ends of the oligomers were phosphorylated prior
to the amplification reaction using a standard protocol (18).
The amplification comprised incubation of the reaction mix at
94TC for 2 min before addition of enzyme; this was followed
by 30 cycles of 2 min each at 92TC, 480C, and 720C in turn,
using an automated device (19). At the end of the 30th cycle,
the samples were incubated for 15 min at 72°C to complete
any partial strands. Amplified fragments were analyzed by
agarose gel electrophoresis, with or without restriction enzyme digestion, using standard methods (18) and blotted with
specific probes for the LDL-receptor cDNA as described
(16). Probes specific for each segment were prepared by
random primed synthesis labeling with dCT32P (20) of the
equivalent amplified fragments of plasmid pLDLR3 (a fulllength cDNA clone for the human LDL receptor, kindly
provided by D. Russell, Dallas). Amplified fragments were
excised from low-melting-point agarose gels (Sigma) and
cloned into the Sma I site of M13mpl8 (21), and their
nucleotide sequence was determined using a Sequenase kit
(Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge, U.K.). For each fragment, at least one clone with an insert in each orientation was
sequenced; where differences were found at least two of each
orientation were sequenced or the amplified fragment was
analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion.
Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood or from the
nuclear pellets of cultured skin fibroblasts and cultured
lymphoblasts (16) essentially as described by Kunkel et al.
(22). Genomic DNA was amplified with two 21-nucleotide
oligomers that encompassed exons 13 and 14 of the LDLreceptor gene as described above. The reaction mix (100 ,ul)
contained 1 ,ug of genomic DNA and 0.5 ,tg each of oligomers
M and N (see Fig. 3), and the amplification protocol included

incubation for 20 min at 94°C and 5 min at 650C before the
addition of enzyme; this was followed by 30 cycles of
alternately 1 min at 910C and 5 min at 65°C, using a Techne
programable DW-Block (GRI, Essex, U.K.).
RESULTS
To determine the structural basis for defects in LDL-receptor
function in MM's fibroblasts (13), the sequence of the coding
region of the mRNA for the LDL receptor was determined
from six overlapping amplified fragments of =0.5 kb each.
With each pair of oligomers, when the amplified material was
fractionated on an agarose gel and blotted with a series of
32P-labeled probes corresponding to the coding region of the
receptor, a single band of expected molecular weight was
detected. In each case the MM fragment was indistinguishable in size from a normal fragment.
When each amplified fragment from MM was sequenced,
two consistent differences were found between the wild-type
sequence (3) and the sequence of the cDNA in MM. In
fragment AB comprising nucleotides -25 to 470 ofthe coding
region, there was a single base change such that the codon for
amino acid residue 27 was changed from UGU in the wild
type to UGC in MM; this base change does not affect the
cysteine residue at this position. This single base change was
detected in five of five M13 clones of fragment AB and was
found in inserts in both orientations. Other changes were also
detected in fragment AB, but each was present in only one of
five clones and probably represents errors in the amplifications.
The second difference, shown in Fig. 1, occurred in
fragment IJ of MM's cDNA where there was a single base
change such that the codon for amino acid residue 664 was
changed from CCG in the wild type to CUG in MM, substituting leucine for proline at this position. This mutation
introduces a new site for the restriction enzyme Pst I in MM's
cDNA, as shown in Fig. 2. To confirm that this base change
was not an error introduced into the single M13 clone as an
artefact of the amplification reaction, and to determine
whether MM was homozygous or heterozygous for this
mutation, the whole amplified fragment IJ was digested with
Pst I. When the digested fragments were analyzed by blotting
with a labeled probe specific for fragment IJ, a band of 0.43
kb was detected in normal cDNA, whereas a band of 0.34 kb
was detected in MM's cDNA. No fragment of 0.43 kb could
be detected in the Pst I-digested amplified fragment IJ from
two separate preparations of cytoplasmic RNA from MM's
fibroblasts (Fig. 2).

which there are several first cousin marriages (Fig. 4), was

with a probe specific for fragment IJ of the LDL-receptor
cDNA. Members of the family who were diagnosed as
homozygous had two copies of the mutant gene, whereas
heterozygotes had one normal gene and one mutant gene.

DISCUSSION
We have described the defective function of LDL receptors
in cultured skin fibroblasts from homozygous FH subject
MM in detail elsewhere (13, 16). The LDL-receptor mRNA
in MM is 5.3 kb and is synthesized at an apparently normal
rate; it is also subject to regulation by sterols in the

same way

in normal cells (16). A precursor protein of normal mobility
on SDS gels is synthesized at approximately the same rate as
in normal cells, but its rate of maturation in MM's cells is
delayed so that it has an abnormally long half-life (3 hr rather
than 0.5 hr). However, all of the precursor protein eventually
reaches the cell surface where it recycles normally, although
its half-life is 6 hr rather than 10 hr as in normal cells (13). In
fibroblasts cultured in the absence of sterols there is approximately the same amount of LDL-receptor protein as in
as

normal cells, but, whereas almost all of the receptors in
normal cells are in the mature recycling form, in MM's cells
nearly half of the receptor protein is in the precursor form
unable to participate in uptake of LDL (13).
As well as this defect in intracellular transport of the
receptor protein, LDL receptors on the surface of MM
fibroblasts show a reduced affinity for both '25I-labeled-LDL
and very low density lipoprotein with P-mobility. Furthermore, taking into account the reduced number of recycling
receptors in MM's cells compared to normal, LDL receptors
in MM's cells bind less ligand per mole of protein than in
normal cells. Once bound, the ligand is internalized and
degraded normally. These functional differences, together
with the observation that MM's cells also bind less of a
monoclonal antibody to the bovine LDL receptor (23) per
mole of LDL-receptor protein on the cell surface than do
normal cells (13), show that there is a major structural defect
in the LDL-receptor protein in MM's cells that is different
from those described previously (2).
Of the two single base changes found consistently in the
amplified fragments of the LDL-receptor cDNA from MM's
cells only one involved a change in the amino acid sequence
of the protein, that of proline 664 to leucine. This mutation
introduced a new restriction enzyme site that was present in
both copies of MM's LDL-receptor gene, confirming that he
was a true homozygote with two functionally identical genes.
The mutation also cosegregated with clinically diagnosed FH
in MM's large family, which contained two more homozygotes and numerous heterozygotes. Thus it is likely that all of
the defective functions of the LDL receptor in MM skin
fibroblasts can be ascribed to this single amino acid change.
Proline 664 occurs in growth factor-like repeat C, a disulfide- and proline-rich region of the EGF-precursor homology
domain of the LDL-receptor protein. This sequence is highly
conserved between bovine and human LDL-receptor genes
(2), suggesting that it has an important functional role.
Because of the large number of proline residues it is likely
that this region is of irregular structure, and the difference in
amino acid sequence between it and the other two growth
factor-like repeats A and B, which resemble more closely the
sequence found in the EGF precursor itself, suggests that it
is folded differently from them (4). The mutation of proline to
leucine might be expected to have a marked effect on the
folding of the protein, as it would release the constraint on the
flexibility of the chain caused by the rigidity of peptide bonds
adjacent to proline (24). Mutations of proline to leucine in
other proteins have been found both to markedly stabilize the
protein, as in the case of the tryptophan synthase a-subunit
(25) and the A repressor protein (26), and to slightly destabilize it, as in the case of T4 lysozyme (27). Experiments to
compare the stability of the LDL-receptor protein in MM
cells and normal cells are necessary.
Previously described mutations in the LDL-receptor gene
that affect ligand binding have all been localized to the
ligand-binding domain (7-9) or to growth factor repeat A,
which is adjacent to the ligand-binding domain (9). Thus it is
of considerable interest that LDL binding is also affected by
a mutation in growth factor-like repeat C, which is separated
from this previously identified binding region by at least 300
amino acid residues in the primary structure of the protein
(4). These observations suggest that the receptor protein
could be folded so that growth factor-like repeat C is normally
in contact with the ligand-binding region or that the change in
folding of this region is sufficient to disrupt the normal folding
of the binding domain. A third possibility is that the change
in structure may disrupt some interaction between receptor
protein molecules on the cell surface that is essential for
optimum ligand binding. Our observations on the effect of
monoclonal antibody 10A2 on the binding of LDL by MM's
receptors and normal LDL receptors in skin fibroblasts

Several different mutations in the LDL-receptor gene that
affect transport of the newly synthesized protein to the cell
surface have been described (28). One of these, the Lebanese
mutation, is also located in growth factor-like repeat C,
where the codon for Cys-660 is changed to a stop codon. The
truncated protein produced is not processed and becomes
rapidly degraded (29). Of more interest in relation to the
mutation in MM's gene is that of FH 429 (28) in which the
glycine at 544 is changed to valine. In FH 429 cells, the
receptor is not processed to the mature form and is again
more rapidly degraded than normal; thus the effect of this
mutation on processing and transport is different from that of
the proline -* leucine at 664 in the LDL receptor in MM's
cells.
