(Received 30 March, Accepted 6 April)
Two novel CFTR mutations were detected in Greek cystic fibrosis patients. One was a missense
mutation, A46D, and the other a splice mutation, 296+ 1 G - C . Neither was detected on normal
chromosomes.

Greek patients, of which /IF508 had a frequency of
52.7%. Another 18 mutations accounted for 8-4% of
theCF alleles, includingthe two novel mutations identified in exon 2. This approach allowed mutations to be
identified in 75-3% of all CF alleles in our population.8
While screening our panel of Greek CF chromosomes for mutations in exon 2, we identified two
novel mutations of the CFTR gene; one a missense
mutation, named A46D, and the other an mRNA
splicing mutation, 296 + 1 G - C .

Since the identification of the gene encoding the
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR) protein and the initial characterization of the
predominant mutation in the Caucasian population,
AF508, '-~ more than 400 other mutations have been
reported.4 Mutations have been described in all of
the exons and neighbouring intronic sequences of
the CFTR gene, with highest concentration of the
more common mutations occuring in exons coding
for NBF1 .s
To determine the type and frequency of cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations in the Greek population we
screened 184 patients for the most common mutations
(,4F508, G542X, G551D, 621 +IG>T, N1303K and
W1282X) by ASO hybridization and then proceeded
to analyse exons 2, 4, 5, 6a, 6b, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,17b, 19,
20, and 21 by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
(DGGE) as described. 6The DNA sequence of samples
showing a shift in mobility was determined after assymetric PCR as describedZ The six most common
mutations accounted for 66-9% of the CF alleles in

A46D
This novel missence mutation was found in samples
of two unrelated CF patients of Greek origin (0.5%
of all CF alleles). One was a compound heterozygote
A46D/G542X and the other a compound heterozygote with the 621 + I G - T mutation. Sequencing
data from the CF patients and their A46D carrier
parent's DNA samples revealed a C - A substitution

at nucleotide position 269 of the coding region of
exon 2 that leads to a change at codon 46, encoding
aspartic acid instead of alanine. This substitution of
an unpolar by a highly polar (negatively charged)
amino acid residue in the CFTR protein most probably
represents a disease-causing allele. The alanine at
position 46 is strongly conserved in other species."
Moreover, this missense was not found in more than
60 normal chromosomes of CF heterozygotes,
screened by ASO hybridization. Both patients were
diagnosed at about 4 years of age. The clinical characteristics of the two patients are listed in Table 1.
We cannot conclude anything about the severity of
the A46D mutation, since one of our patients is PI
and the other PS, although missense mutations located
in the first transmembrane domain are usually associated with mild clinical severity and with pancreatic sufficiency. 1° Furthermore both patients carry
a severe allele on the other chromosome.

296+1G-C
This novel mRNA splicing mutation was found in one
CF chromosome (0.3% of all Greek CF alleles) and
is a G - C substitution at nucleotide 2 9 6 + 1 of the
CFTR gene, affecting the first nucleotide of the consensus sequence in the 5' splice site of intron 2. We
used ASO hybridization to confirm this mutation
following the sequencing data of the patient's DNA
sample. The male patient carries an unknown mutation on the other chromosome. His clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. Although this patient

a mild clinical phenotype. Since the 2 9 6 + 1 G - C ,
as an mRNA splicing mutation, is severe, this implies
that the unknown CF mutation on his other chromosome is probably mild.
