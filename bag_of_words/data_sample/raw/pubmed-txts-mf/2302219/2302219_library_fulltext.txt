Summary:
The lysosomal
degradation
of sulfatide
requires
the specific
enzyme,
arylsulfatase
A, as well as a heat stable
protein
called
sphingolipid
activator protein-l
(SAP-l).
While most patients
with metachromatic
leukodystrophy
have defects
in arylsulfatase
A, some patients
have defects
in SAP-l.
SAP-l is coded for by a gene on human chromosome 10 that also codes for three
other proposed
SAP. Examination
of the cDNA from two siblings
with SAP-l
deficiency
revealed
a point
mutation
of nucleotide
#650 (counting
from the
initiation
ATG) which is in the SAP-l coding domain.
This C to T transition
changed the codon from threonine
(ACC) to one coding
for isoleucine
(ATC).
This eliminated
the only glycosylation
site
in mature SAP-l and could explain
the findings
made at the protein
level.
