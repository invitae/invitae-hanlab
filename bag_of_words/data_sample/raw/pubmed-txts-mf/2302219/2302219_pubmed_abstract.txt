The lysosomal degradation of sulfatide requires the specific enzyme, arylsulfatase A, as well as a heat stable protein called sphingolipid activator protein-1 (SAP-1). While most patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy have defects in arylsulfatase A, some patients have defects in SAP-1. SAP-1 is coded for by a gene on human chromosome 10 that also codes for three other proposed SAP. Examination of the cDNA from two siblings with SAP-1 deficiency revealed a point mutation of nucleotide #650 (counting from the initiation ATG) which is in the SAP-1 coding domain. This C to T transition changed the codon from threonine (ACC) to one coding for isoleucine (ATC). This eliminated the only glycosylation site in mature SAP-1 and could explain the findings made at the protein level.
