ABSTRACT
In an effort to clarify the role of amino acid hydrophobicity at the p6
position in sickling we have made recombinant hemoglobin tetramers
containing p6 Val (Hb S) and p6 Leu (Hb Leu). Recombinant Hb S and Hb
Leu had the same electrophoretic mobility, chromatographic behavior, and
absorption spectrum. The deoxy form of both tetramers polymerized in
high phosphate buffer (1.8 M) and exhibited distinct delay times prior to
polymerization. The kinetics of polymerization.for recombinant and native
Hb S were similar, while recombinant Hb Leu polymerized more readily.
The solubility of deoxy Hb Leu was less than deoxy Hb S, indicating that
rapid polymerization and decreased solubility of deoxyhemoglobin is
accelerated with increasing hydrophobicity at the p6 position.

JNTRODUCTION
Sickle cell disease is caused by an A to T change at the codon for the
sixth amino acid (GAG to GTG) of P-globin, and results in the insertion of
valine instead of glutamic acid at the p6 position. This change results in
decreased solubility of deoxygenated Hb S, and causes polymerization
which leads to the formation of an extensive network of fibers in red blood

cells. The cells sickle, lose their deformability and often get clogged in
blood vessels, which may lead to hemolysis and vaso-occlusive crises in
patients with this disease. However, the relationship between amino acid
substitution at the p6 position and the detailed mechanism of
polymerization is not clear.
The use of site-specific mutagenesis is a powerful approach to
understanding the relationships between protein structure and function.
Nagai et al used the expression vector pLcllFXp to produce several
modified human hemoglobins (Hbs) for X-ray, nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), and functional studies (1,2,3,4,5).
Oxygen-binding
properties of these recombinant Hbs were essentially the same as those
of native human Hb. Furthermore, analysis of the differential map from Xray studies indicated that the recombinant tetramers were structurally
identical to native Hb except for small local differences near the site of the
mutation. These results indicate that the recombinant globin chains can
be correctly refolded and reconstituted into functional Hb tetramers. Using
this method, we have engineered P6 Val- and p6 Leu-containing Hbs in
an effort to clarify the role of amino acid hydrophobicity and side chain
structure at the p6 position in polymerization of deoxy Hb S.

METHODS
The pLcllFXp-globin expression vector directs synthesis of a hybrid
protein containing 31 amino terminal residues of the cll protein from
lambda phage fused to a Factor Xa cleavage site (Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg) linked
in frame to human p-globin. Fusion protein is isolated from E. coli and
cleaved with Factor Xa, resulting in liberation of authentic p-globin which
is then assembled into Hb tetramers (2).
For mutagenesis, the expression vector pLcllFXp was digested with
Sac I and Hind Ill, and the approximately 1 kb insert was subcloned into
M13mp18.

The 6th amino acid codon of the p-globin cDNA was

mutagenized from GAG (glutamic acid) to GTG (valine - Hb S) or CTG
(leucine - Hb Leu) employing synthetic oligonucleotide primers and an
Amersham mutagenesis kit (6). The constructs were verified by DNA
sequence analysis of single-stranded mutagenized cDNA employing the
dideoxy chain termination technique (7). Following sequence verification,
the Sac I/Hind Ill fragment was subcloned back into the expression vector.
Cultures of E. coli (M5219) containing each expression vector were
grown overnight and fusion proteins were isolated.

Production of fusion

protein was initially accomplished by induction with a temperature shift
(3OOC => 42OC) to inactivate the temperature-sensitive lambda repressor;
however, our more recent studies show constitutive expression of the
fusion protein at 3OOC. Cells from overnight growths at 30OC were lysed,
treated with DNase I, and soluble proteins removed by centrifugation (2).
After 3-5 washes with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, the resulting pellet was
dissolved in 8 M urea/50 mM Tris buffer, and purified by ion-exchange
chromatography (CM-Sepharose).

The partially-purified fusion protein

420

was dialyzed against distilled water, lyophilized, solubilized in 1Yo (v/v)
formic acid, and further purified on a Sephacryl $200 column (3 x 100
cm) equilibrated in 1% (v/v) formic acid/l mM DTT. Cleavage of fusion
protein with activated Factor Xa (Boehringer Mannheirn, Indianapolis, IN)
results in liberation of authentic p-globin.

Confirmation of N-terminal

protein sequence for recombinant p6 Val and p6 Leu globins was
accomplished by Edman degradation employing an automatic protein
microsequencer (ABI 477A pulsed-liquid protein sequencer, Applied
Biosysterns, Inc., Foster City, CA).
Tetrameric Hbs were directly reconstituted in cleavage buffer (8)
following addition of cyanoheme and native a-globin chains in the CO
form to the recombinant p-globin chains. Reconstituted Hb was reduced
with sodium dithionite under an atmosphere of CO gas, and then purified
by CM-52 ion exchange chromatography (2).

The recombinant Hb

tetramers were further purified on a Mono S column (Pharmacia, Uppsala,
Sweden).

Hb concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using
millimolar extinction coefficients of 12.5 at 555 nm and 13.5 at 541 nm for
monomeric

deoxy and oxy Hb, respectively (9).

Kinetic studies of

polymerization of deoxy Hbs were performed using the turbidirnetric
method in 1.8 M phosphate buffer as described elsewhere (10). Hb
solubility was determined by measurement of soluble Hb concentration
after removal of polymers by filtration through a 0.45 pm membrane filter
(Millipore Co., Bedford, MA) (11).

stages in the purification of the recombinant P-globin are depicted in Fig.

Following lysis, DNAse treatment, and washes with Triton X-100 as

described in Methods, the resulting pellet was purified by ion exchange
chromatography (Fig. 1, lane 2). The partially-purified fusion protein was
further purified on a Sephacryl 5-200 column (Fig. 1, lane 3) and cleaved
with activated Factor Xa, resulting in liberation of authentic P-globin (Fig.

The overall yield of recombinant tetrameric Hbs after reconstitution and
purification was approximately

The recombinant Hb S and Hb Leu

tetramers had the same electrophoretic mobility as normal Hb S on
cellulose acetate electrophoresis (Fig. 2), and their absorption spectrum
showed typical characteristics of carbonmonoxy Hb.
Polymerization of deoxy Hb S both in vitro and in red blood cells is
characterized by a delay time during which nuclei form and promote
polymer formation (1 2,13,14). Hb polymerization can be studied in vitro
employing high concentrations of phosphate buffer (10). High phosphate
buffer concentrations (1.8 M) are used since Hb solubility is greatly
reduced, facilitating polymerization at low Hb concentrations (10). For
example, the concentration of deoxy Hb S required for polymerization in
1.8 M phosphate buffer

is about 300 times lower than that in 0.1 M

phosphate buffer (10). Hence, the kinetics of polymer formation of modified
recombinant tetramers can be readily analyzed using very small amounts

of Hb.
The kinetics of polymerization in 1.8

M phosphate buffer for native and

recombinant Hb S were similar. Each exhibited a distinct delay time prior
to polymer formation, which varied inversely as a function of Hb

concentration (Fig. 3).

showed that both recombinant and native Hb S tetramers exhibited
identical polmerization kinetics as a function of Hb concentration.
Recombinant Hb S did, however, demonstrate a longer delay time prior to
polymerization compared with native Hb S at the lowest Hb concentration
studied.

This difference could reflect the presence of improperly or

incompletely folded recombinant tetramers; however, further studies are
required to clarify this observation. Recombinant deoxy Hb S polymers
also depolymerized when the temperature was decreased to Oo C (data not
shown), just like native deoxy Hb S (10).
Deoxy Hb Leu

also polymerized in vitro with a distinct delay time

which was inversely proportional to Hb concentration, just like native and
recombinant Hb S (Fig. 4). The relationship between delay time and Hb
concentration is plotted as the log of one over the delay time versus the
log of Hb concentration (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the line for recombinant Hb
Leu was shifted to the left of that for native and recombinant Hb S,
indicating that Hb Leu polymerized more readily than Hb S at comparable
Hb concentrations. These data indicate that polymerization of deoxy Hb

Hbs A , C and Machida was linearly related to the amino acid
hydrophobicity at the p6 position as determined by calculation of transfer
energy from water to organic solvents (16).

There was an abrupt

decrease in solubility for the deoxy forms of Hb S and Hb Leu which
contain more hydrophobic amino acid residues at the p6 position (Fig.

We previously hypothesized that the low solubility of deoxy Hb S could
be attributed to strong intermolecular hydrophobic associations caused
by cooperative stereospecific protein-protein interactions between p6 Val
on one molecule and the U-shaped EF helix region on another (1 1). We
also proposed that this interaction could be enhanced by more
hydrophobic amino acids at the p6 position when Hb molecules were in
the deoxy form (1 1). Intermolecular interaction of p6 Val with p85 Phe and

p88 Leu was previously suggested from X-ray crystallographic analysis of
deoxy Hb S (18), although studies with Hbs A , S, and C have suggested
that substitutions at the p6 position do not lead to dramatic changes in the
crystal structure of the deoxy form (1 9, 20).
The degree of hydrophobicity of the p6 amino acid, in addition to its
shape, size and position of side chains in the molecule may determine the
strength of the interaction with neighboring tetramers. Our previous (1 1)
and present studies on the solubility of various mutants indicate that the
extent of this interaction in the deoxy form varies discontinuously when
comparing hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids at the p6 position
(see Fig. 5).
Most recently Baudin-Chich et al (21) reported that the recombinant
Hb tetramer ct2P,611e

polymerized in vitro more readily and exhibited

decreased solubility in 1 . 8 M phosphate buffer compared to native Hb S .
The results reported for that mutant Hb are very similar to those we have
reported here for Hb Leu. However, more detailed studies comparing the
properties of p611e - and p6Leu

-

containing tetramers are now required.

Val, Leu, and Ile at the p6 position all facilitate polymerization and their
corresponding tetramers have lower than expected solubilities in the
deoxy form based on comparison with tetramers containing more

hydrophiiic replacements at the p6 position. Our present solubility results
of recombinant deoxy and oxy Hb Leu and the recent results using
recombinant deoxy Hb He (a2p2611e) (21) further support this notion, since
substitution of Leu or He for Val might be expected to enhance
intermolecular hydrophobic interactions. Thus, these protein-protein
interactions would also depend on the tertiary and quaternary structural
configuration in the deoxy-form. Nonpolar regions in deoxy Hb molecules
would then associate cooperatively with the hydrophobic acceptor pocket
of an adjoining molecule, and thereby accelerate polymer formation
resulting in decreased solubility. Once oxygen binds to deoxy Hb, the
molecule undergoes a conformational change from the T (Tense) to the R
(Relaxed) state which would result in disruption of these proposed
cooperative hydrophobic interactions (18).
