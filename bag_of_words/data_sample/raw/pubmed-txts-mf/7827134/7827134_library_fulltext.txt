Abstract
A single nucleotide transversion (G + C) in the 5’ donor site of intron 7 of the P-hexosaminidase a-chain gene was identified in two
Portuguese patients with infantile Tay-Sachs disease. One patient was found to be homozygous and the other a compound heterozygote
with the four-base insertion in exon 11 on the other allele. In fibroblasts from the homozygous patient the /3-hexosaminidase (Y mRNA
was observed as a nearly undetectable fast migrating band. Through cDNA-PCR amplification and hybridization with full length (Y
cDNA several fragments of smaller size than the normal transcript were detected, most of them lacking exon 7. We propose that this point
mutation in the 5’ donor site of intron 7 of the P-hexosaminidase a-chain gene is responsible for an inefficient and abnormal processing
of the mutant transcript, resulting in functional abnormality.

1. Introduction
GM2-Gangliosidosis
is a group of recessively inherited
neurodegenerative
disorders, characterized
by lysosomal
accumulation of GM2 ganglioside. Three glycoproteins are
essential for in vivo degradation of GM2 ganglioside P-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase
(EC 3.2.1.52) (Y and P-sub-

units and the GM2 activator protein - each encoded by a
distinct gene. Abnormalities in these genes lead respectively to variant B, variant 0 and variant AB. Genetic
defects in the a-subunit result in loss of P-hexosaminidase
A ((Y/I heterodimer) activity, and that of P-subunit abolishes activities both isoenzymes, &hexosaminidase A and
B (homodimer /3p) [l]. The classic infantile form of the
genetic @hexosaminidase (Y chain defects is Tay-Sachs
disease that occurs at a high frequency among Ashkenazi
Jews. This disease is rapidly progressive and fatal. Two
mutations, a splicing defect at the 5’ donor site of intron 12
and a 4-base insertion within exon 11, account for almost
all cases of classic infantile Ashkenazi Tay-Sachs disease

(Y chain mutation

[2-61. A clinically typical but genetically distinct infantile
form of (Y subunit defect, occurring among FrenchCanadian population, was found to be due to a major
deletion at the 5’ end of the P-hexosaminidase (Y chain
gene [7,8]. In both the infantile Ashkenazi Jewish and the
French Canadian forms, no or little detectable mRNA or
enzyme protein is produced. Besides these ethnically restricted forms, many distinct abnormalities underlaying
defective a-subunit have been described but they occur
panethnically at lower frequencies. In some forms of the
disease such as the enzymologically unique Bl variant, an
immunologically detectable but catalytically defective enzyme protein is produced. The first and more frequent
mutation in the a-subunit associated to Bl variant phenotype was the G-533 --, A transition in exon 5 (DN-allele),
translating into arginine-histidine substitution at residue
178 [9]. Three other point mutations causing the Bl phenotype have been reported, C-532 -+ T in exon 5 [lo], G-772
-+ C in exon 7 [ll] and G-574 + C in exon 6 [12]. This
rare disorder, with a wide ethnic and geographic distribution, is the most frequent form of GM2 Gangliosidosis in
Portugal [13]. Among Portuguese patients with genetic
defects in the a-subunit, the ‘DN-allele’ represents 77% of
the mutant alleles.

In the present study we report the presence of a mutation at + 1 position of intron 7 splice site of P-hexosaminidase a chain gene in two Portuguese unrelated patients with the infantile phenotype of Tay-Sachs disease.
Its implication on transcription and translation is further
evaluated.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Clinical description

We studied two unrelated patients. Both had the onset
of the disease around 6 months of age. Patient 1, when
examined at 13 months of age, was a floppy baby and in
spite of a marked hypotonia, her upper limbs were in a
pronation position and pyramidal signs were present. There
was a marked startle reaction to various stimuli. Cherry red
spot was seen in fundi. Her parents are related as third
cousins. Patient 2, when seen at 14 months of age, was
unable to sit and to control her head. Acoustic startle was
prominent even with minimal stimuli. She was a very
hypotonic child with brisk reflexes and bilateral Babinski
sign. Generalised tonic-clonic seizure was also observed.
Optic fundi showed bilateral cherry red spot.
2.2. Commercial

materials

4-Methylumbelliferyl-N-acetylglucosamine
(4-MUGlcNAc) was purchased from Sigma and its sulfated
derivative (4-MU-GlcNAc-6-S) from Moscerdam (The
Netherlands). The commercial preparation of the sulfated
substrate was purified by chromatographic procedures as
described by Beccari et al. [14]. DE-52 cellulose was
obtained from Whatman Biosystems, Cellogel strips from
Chemetron and bovine serum albumin (BSA) from Sigma.
[-y-3’P]dATP ( > 5000 Ci/mmol), [ (Y-~~P]~ATP( > 1000
Ci/mmol) and [ a-32P]dCTP ( > 3000 Ci/mmol) were
purchased from Amersham. T4 polynucleotide kinase was
purchased from New England Biolabs. Sources for nonstandard materials will be indicated below as appropriate.

assays

The /?-hexosaminidase activity was determined against
the synthetic neutral (4-MU-GlcNAc) and sulfated (4MU-GlcNAc-6-S) substrates, based on the assay conditions previously described [16,17]. Total extracts were
incubated with 4-MU-GlcNAc (1.7 mM final concentration) in 0.1 M citrate phosphate buffer pH 4.4 at 37°C for
15 min or with 4-MU-GlcNAc-6-S (1.0 mM final concentration) in 0.2 M citrate phosphate buffer pH 4.0 at 37°C
for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 1.0
ml of 1 M of glycine-NaOH pH 10.0 and the fluorescence
measured on a Aminco SPR spectrofluorometer with an
excitation and emission wavelengths of 366 and 446 nm,
respectively. Protein was determined according to Lowry
et al. [18] using BSA as standard.
2.5. Cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis
Cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis of P-hexosaminidase was performed on Cellogel strips (5.7 cm X 14.0 cm)
as previously described [19]. After electrophoresis phexosaminidase activity was detected by incubation at
37°C with 4-MU-GlcNAc, 2.0 mM in 0.1 M citrate phosphate buffer pH 4.75 for 10 min or with 4-MU-GlcNAc-6S, 2.0 mM in 0.1 M citrate phosphate buffer pH 4.0 for 45
min. The fluorescence was developed with 1 M glycineNaOH, pH 10.0, visualized at 366 nm and photographed
with type 667 Polaroid film.
2.6. DEAE-cellulose

chromatography

Sonicated extracts containing equal amounts of protein
were applied to 1 ml DE-52 column equilibrated with 10
mM sodium phosphate buffer and 0.6 ml fractions were
collected. After unretained P-hexosaminidase B has been
eluted, the remaining isoenzymes were separated using a
linear NaCl gradient (0 to 0.35 M in 15 ml of the column
buffer). The enzymatic activities of eluted fractions were
determined against 4-MU-GlcNAc and 4-MU-GlcNAc-6-S.

2.7. PCR amplification
Leucocytes were isolated from peripheral blood. Leucocyte-pellets were extracted by brief sonication in 0.1%
(v/v> Triton X-100. After centrifugation for 30 min at
15 000 X g the supematant (reffered to as extract) was
assayed for enzyme activities. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)transformed lymphoblast cell lines were established as
described [15]. Skin fibroblasts were grown and propagated in RPM1 medium supplemented with antibiotics and
5% FCS at 37°C in 5% CO,. From patient 2 no biological
material was available and therefore only her parents could
be studied.

of genomic DNA

DNA was isolated from lymphoblasts according to the
standard procedure [20]. Exon 7 and flanking intron sequences of the a-subunit gene were amplified by PCR.
One primer was within intron 6,48 bases upstream of exon
7 (5’-GCTAGCTITCAGGAAGTGTGAACC-3’ ) and the
other was within intron 7, 40 bases downstream of exon 7
(5’-TAACAAGCAGAGTCCCTCTGGT-3’). Initial denaturation was at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of
denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s
and extension at 72°C for 1.5 min.

2.8. Direct sequencing of PCR products
A portion from the first amplification reaction was
subjected to assymmetric amplification using only the
antisense primer. The assymmetric PCR products were
freed from primers, nucleotides and salts using QIAGEN
kit (Diisseldorf, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
procedure. Sequencing of the sense strand was performed
using Sequenase (version 2.0) kit (US Biochemical) according to the procedure recommended by the mamtfacturer.

Total RNA was isolated from fibroblast cell lines of
patient 1 and a control according to the procedure described by Chomczynski and Sacchi [21]. Integrity of total
RNA was checked by electrophoresis, through the estimation of 28S/18S ratio. About 25 pg of total RNA were
electrophoresed in a 1% agarose/formaldehyde denaturing
gel and transferred to GeneScreen Plus nylon membrane
(NEN Research Products). Hybridization with the fulllength normal P-hexosaminidase a-subunit cDNA [22]
labelled with [ CF~‘P]~CTP were performed using the
Megaprime’” DNA Labeling System (Amersham) according to the instructions of manufacturer. Blots were exposed
to Kodak X-ray film at -70°C using DuPont Cronex
lightning Plus intensifying screen. The Phexosaminidase
P-subunit cDNA was used as control probe.
Total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using
GeneAmp RNA PCR Kit (Perkin Elmer C&us), according
to the manufacturer’s procedure with 2 pg of total fibroblast RNA, oligo d(Tj16 as primer and 1.5 h incubation at
42°C. The amplification of the segment corresponding to
the entire coding sequence was performed using 40 pmol
of each forward (S-TCCGAGAGGGGAGACCAGCGG-3' ,
located 24 bp upstream of the A of the initiation codon)
and reverse (S-TCACCTACAGCCAGCACCCTC-J,

study

In leucocytes, the residual /3-hexosaminidase A activity
(4-MU-GlcNAc-6-S) was less than 1.5% in patient 1 and
about 50-60% of control mean in obligate carriers (Table
1). Fig. 1A and B show the separation of P-hexosaminidase isoenzymes present in leucocytes from the patient 1
and a control, respectively by cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis and ion-exchange chromatography. As can be
observed, no activity of /3-hexosaminidase A against 4MU-GlcNAc and 4-MU-GlcNAc-6-S was detected in patient 1.
3.2. Molecular study
Direct sequencing of the PCR-amplified genomic DNA
from patient 1 showed the G --) C transversion at + 1
position of intron 7 (Fig. 2). Nucleotide sequence of DNA
from the parents of patient 2 showed that both the mutant
cytosine and the normal guanosine were present in the

mother whereas the father presented the normal sequence
around the junction of exon 7 and intron 7 (data not
shown). Thus, the patient 1 was homozygous for the
G -+ C transversion at position + 1 of intron 7 and the
patient 2 was concluded to be a compound heterozygote
with only one allele carrying this mutation.
The effect of the G + C transversion in 5’ donor site of
intron 7 on (Y mRNA was firstly analyzed by Northern
blot of total RNA (Fig. 3A). In contrast to a band of
expected size observed in control fibroblasts, a nearly
undetectable band of a smaller size than the normal was
observed in the patient. Using the appropriate oligonucleotides the entire coding sequence was reverse transcribed
and the Q chain cDNA amplified by polymerase chain
reaction. The length of the amplified product obtained for
patient 1 was compared with that of the control after
agarose gel electrophoresis, blotting and hybridization using either full-length (Y chain cDNA or exon 7 as probe
(Fig. 3B). Using the full-length cDNA as the probe, only
the expected band of 1650 bp was seen in the normal
control, while multiple bands of varying sizes, mostly
smaller than the normal 1650 bp, were present in patient 1.
When exon 7 was the probe, none of the multiple bands in
the patient’s fibroblasts were detectable when the film was
exposed for the normal length of time. When over-exposed, a faint signal was detected for the major, fastmigrating band. Thus, most of the amplified fragments
from patient 1 fibroblasts lack exon 7. The faster-migrating
band detectable in the Northern blotting (Fig. 3A) can be
interpreted from its size and lack exon 7 as an (Y subunit
mRNA lacking exon 7 but otherwise normal (1517 bp).
When cultured firoblasts were labeled with tritiated
leucine for 22 h, the mature (Y subunit form were not
detected (Fig. 4).
The G + C transversion in the 5’ end splicing site of
intron 7 creates an AZuI (5’-AGCT-3’) restriction site as
well as it abolishes the restriction sites for EcoRII and
ScrFI. Since the last two restriction enzymes are used in
the diagnosis of Gly-269 mutation, the detection of this
splicing mutation can be carried out through the amplification of the exon 7/intron 7 boundary region of genomic
DNA followed by the digestion of the resulting fragment
with AluI. The products of the digestion can be examined
by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel. The principle
of this assay is shown schematically in Fig. 5 (bottom).
The digestion yelds a 216 bp from the normal allele or 176
bp and 40 bp fragments from the mutant allele. The
enzyme also produces an undetectable 5 bp fragment from
both alleles. As it can be observed in the Fig. 5 (top), the
restriction enzyme assay showed in patient 1 both 176 bp
and 40 bp fragments and in her parents the three fragments
of 216 bp, 176 bp and 40 bp, as expected for heterozygotes. In the mother of patient 2 the three fragments
were also present, whereas in her father only the 216 bp
fragment was detected. These results corroborated the
sequencing data.

The DNA from both parents of patient 2 was tested for
the presence of exon 11 4 bp insertion and the exon 12
G + C splice site mutation by hybridization with allele
specific oligonucleotides (Fig. 6). A positive signal was
obtained for the insertion mutation probe in the amplified
DNA from the father.

4. Discussion
The G + C mutation in the 5’ splice site of intron 7 of
P-hexosaminidase a-subunit gene was identified in two
unrelated Portuguese patients, one being homozygous and
the other a compound heterozygote with the 4 bp insertion
within exon 11. Since the first GT at the 5’ donor site of

introns are known to be obligatory [24], the transversion is
expected to result in splicing failure at the junction due to
the decrease of the donor site efficiency. Our data indicate
that the junctional mutation indeed results in defective
splicing of the transcripts. By Northern analysis of total
RNA present in fibroblasts from the homozygous patient,
the Phexosaminidase (Y mRNA was observed as a nearly
undetectable fast migrating band. Through amplification of
(Y chain transcripts by RT-PCR several fragments of
smaller size than the normal transcipt hybridized with
full-length (Y cDNA. The high percentage of abnormal
spliced molecules might result from an altered balance
between normal spliced molecules and those resulting
from alternative splicing. Moreover, the smaller fragments
are expected to be over-represented after amplification,

with respect to longer fragments. The mRNA quantification by cDNA-PCR is only possible in the exponential
phase of amplification, generally before the 20ti cycle of
amplification, and at 35”’ cycle the amount of amplified
material should depend poorly on the initial amount of
material to be amplified. Therefore, the data should only
be considered as qualitative and not quantitative. The
longest fragment observed in homozygous patient fibroblasts was identified as corresponding to (YmRNA lacking
exon 7. The skip of the exon immediately preceding a
mutation at the 5’ donor site has been reported in the
Ashkenazi intron 12 splicing mutation [5]. Further studies
will be needed to evaluate if the transcripts lacking other
segments beside exon 7 might result from the presence of
another Tay-Sachs disease mutation or from normally occurring miss-splicing [5], although they were not detected
in control normal fibroblasts studied.
The sequence of mRNAs lacking just exon 7 is in frame
and it would encode a protein shortened of 43 amino acids
(those encoded by exon 7). However, the labeled mutated
(Y subunit was undetectable in fibroblasts from homozygous patient. We do know from the Northern blotting
result that the (Y subunit mRNA is nearly undetectable.
The lack of immunological detectable (Y subunit, therefore, is most likely due to instability of the abnormally
spliced mRNA and not due to a mutant protein immunologically unrecognizable by the antiserum raised against
the normal enzyme protein. The presence of the mutation
G --) C in 5’ splice site of intron 7 in heterozygosity with
the exon 11 4-bp insertion (mRNA negative) is also expected to result in a functional abnormality.

Another mutation at + 1 position of intron 7, the G -+ A
transition, has been previously reported [25] in three unrelated families of French-Canadian origin. The patients
were heterozygous for this mutation, carrying in the other
allele the 7.6 kb deletion at 5’ end of (Y chain gene. The
effect of G + A mutation on mRNA expression was evaluated by RT-PCR. In contrast to G + C transversion, this
mutation appears to result in the absence of LYmRNA
since the RT-PCR procedure should have yielded reasonable quantities of an amplified segment even when the
mRNA is unstable and rapidly degraded.
Both mutations at + 1 position of intron 7 abolishe the
restriction sites for the enzymes EcoRII and Scr FI, usually used in the diagnosis of adult Tay-Sachs disease
mutation. However the G + C transversion crates an AluI
restriction site which specifically allows the detection of
this mutation. Therefore, the G + C transversion can be
easily and quickly screened with a restriction assay with
AluI endonuclease, whereas unambiguous diagnosis of
G -+ A transition requires allele-specific oligonucleotide
hybridization.
The absence of G -+ C mutation at + 1 position of
intron 7 and the infantile Ashkenazi Jewish alleles in other
two patients with Tay-Sachs disease indicates that other
disease causing mutation(s) are present in Portuguese population (data not shown). Interesting is the abstract of
another group [26] which reported the presence of the
intron 7 splicing mutation in heterozygosity with the
Ashkenazi 4 bp insertion in a patient of Portuguese origin.
Anyway, the frequency of any of these mutations in Portugese population must be quite low, as the occurrence of
Tay-Sachs disease is rare. However, it is useful1 to know
the molecular defect underlaying the Tay-Sachs disease in
the families at risk since the use of the DNA-based test in
addition to the diagnostic tests currently used to detect the
carriers allow a more accurately definition of the carrier
state.
