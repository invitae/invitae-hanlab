ABSTRACT
Androgens act through a receptor protein
(AR) to mediate sex differentiation and development of the
male phenotype. We have isolated the eight exons in the amino
acid coding region of the AR gene from a human X chromosome
library. Nucleotide sequences of the AR gene intron/exon
boundaries were determined for use in designing synthetic
oligonucleotide primers to bracket coding exons for amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. Genomic DNA was
amplified from 46,XY phenotypic female siblings with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. AR binding affinity for
dihydrotestosterone in the affected siblings was lower than in
normal males, but the binding capacity was normal. Sequence
analysis of amplified exons demonstrated within the AR steroid-binding domain (exon G) a single guanine to adenine
mutation, resulting in replacement of valine with methionine at
amino acid residue 866. As expected, the carrier mother had
both normal and mutant AR genes. Thus, a single point
mutation in the steroid-binding domain of the AR gene correlated with the expression of an AR protein ineffective in
stimulating male sexual development.

cell cultures (23-25). However, the study of natural mutations allows correlations not only between structure and
function but also between structure and phenotype. For
example, the molecular nature of a mutation in the AR gene
has been recently reported in a family found to have a
deletion of the entire steroid-binding domain (26) associated
with loss of androgen-binding activity and complete AIS.
Identification of natural gene deletions and point mutations
offers an opportunity to study structural alterations in AR
that affect sex differentiation, development, and reproductive function.
In this study, our aims were to determine the location of the
hAR gene splice sites for comparison with other steroid
receptors and to obtain the intron sequences flanking each
exon to enable us to design oligonucleotide primers for exon
DNA amplification by using the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) (27). Amplification of exons made it possible to
sequence the AR gene- coding regions of affected individuals
in a family with complete AIS (28, 29) and revealed a single
point mutation within the steroid-binding domain.

Androgens act through a receptor protein to promote differentiation and development of the male phenotype (1, 2). The
androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the steroid receptor
family, which is part of a larger nuclear receptor superfamily
(3-5). These receptor proteins are related by sequence similarities within their "zinc finger" DNA-binding domains and
by ligand-dependent regulation of specific gene transcription
(3-5). Complementary DNAs of many members of the nuclear receptor family have been cloned (refs. 3-5 and references therein and ref. 6), including the human receptors for
thyroid hormone, retinoic acid, vitamin D, glucocorticoid,
progesterone, mineralocorticoid, estrogen, and androgen (713). Genomic clones have been described for the human
estrogen (14), human vitamin D (15), chicken thyroid hormone (16), and chicken progesterone (17) receptors. To
further understand the evolution and function of steroid
receptors in eukaryotes and to identify mutations in the
human AR (hAR) gene that cause the androgen insensitivity
syndrome (AIS), we undertook to clone the AR gene.**
In 46,XY individuals, X chromosome-linked androgen
insensitivity results in a spectrum of developmental abnormalities ranging from a complete external female phenotype
to partially masculinized ambiguous genitalia (1, 2, 18-21)
and may include some infertile males with apparently normal
genitalia but defective spermatogenesis (22). Mutations produced in vitro have allowed structure-function analyses of
nuclear receptors by examining effects of these mutations in

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation and Analysis of hAR Genomic Clones. Exon specific oligonucleotide probes were located within the AR
cDNA by comparison of the hAR amino acid sequence (10)
with the gene structure and amino acid sequence of the
chicken progesterone receptor (cPR) (17). These exon specific oligonucleotides and hAR cDNA fragments were used as
probes to identify four genomic clones from a partial Sau3A,
bacteriophage A Charon 35, flow-sorted, X chromosome
genomic library (XLAOXNLO1, obtainable from the American Type Culture Collection). Exons C-H, contained within
the clones, were isolated, subcloned, and sequenced as
described for the isolation of exons A and B (7, 10). Exon
sequences of hAR were compared with exons of other steroid
receptors by the GCG alignment program (30).
Experimental Subjects. Informed written consent was obtained from each individual according to The Johns Hopkins
Institutional Guidelines for Clinical Investigation. The three
affected 46,XY siblings with complete AIS and their mother
have been described (28, 29, 31, 32). The affected siblings had
normal female external genitalia with absence of uterus and
fallopian tubes. A short vagina ended in a blind pouch.

pH 8.3/200 ,M each of the four deoxyribonucleotides.
Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase) (3.75
units) (Cetus) and each oligonucleotide at 20 AM were used
per reaction. Amplification conditions consisted of an initial
denaturing step at 950C for 5 min, annealing at 600C for 1 min,
and polymerization at 720C for 6 min, followed by 30 cycles
of 950C for 30 sec, 60'C for 1 min, and 720C for 6 min with a
3-sec increment per cycle in polymerization time. For oligonucleotide pairs A7-A8 and A9-A10, an annealing temperature of 650C reduced the number of nonspecific fragments. In
addition, 60 cycles were used for oligonucleotide pair A7-A8,
which amplifies a fragment with high G+C content. Amplified fragments of the correct size were ligated into blunt end
M13 vectors and sequenced (7, 10). Errors due to Taq
polymerase misincorporation were detected by sequencing
two independent clones of each orientation.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Six genomic clones containing exons of the amino acid coding
regions of the hAR gene were isolated from a human X
chromosome A library by using hAR cDNA and synthetic
oligonucleotide probes. Although the genomic clone inserts
averaged 15 kilobases (kb) and the mRNA of hAR was 10-11
kb (7, 9, 10), only exons D and E and exons F, G, and H were
found in the same clones (data not shown). Calculations
based on five nonoverlapping clones averaging 15 kb yielded
a size estimate of >75 kb for the hAR gene. Sequences of the
hAR coding exons and flanking intron regions are shown in
Fig. 1. Cloned genomic exon and flanking intron sequences
were confirmed by sequencing PCR amplified fragments of
genomic DNA. Development of a method utilizing PCR for
rapid analysis of mutations in the coding regions of the AR
gene required that we sequence only far enough into the
flanking introns to allow selection of suitable synthetic oligonucleotide primers to bracket each exon. Thus, the large
central regions of each intron remain to be sequenced.
Exons

hAR

With the determination of the intron/exon splice junction
sequences, both evolutionary and functional analyses of the
hAR and its mutations are now possible. The intron/exon
boundaries have the canonical splice consensus sequences
(double underlined in Fig. 1) (33). Splice sites of the hAR gene
and those of human estrogen receptor (hER) (14) and cPR (17)
genes are remarkably similar in location and flanking amino
acid sequences (data not shown). By comparison with other
homologous steroid receptor cDNAs and cloned steroid
receptor genes (hAR, cPR, hER, and hMR) (MR, mineralocorticoid receptor), the probable splice sites of the other
as yet unreported steroid receptor gene sequences (hPR,
hMR, and hGR) (GR, glucocorticoid receptor) could be
predicted. Comparisons of their exons reveal regions of
evolutionary conservation of essential functions (Fig. 2).
The most highly conserved exons, B and C, encode the first
and second zinc finger motifs, respectively, and make up the
DNA-binding domain (3-5). Within these and other exons,
sequence identity of hAR is closer to hPR, hMR, and hGR
than to hER (Fig. 2). Only the second zinc finger exon of
hER, exon C, has a high degree of sequence similarity with
hAR. The large N-terminal domain contained within the A
exon has little similarity with other receptors. This exon
appears to contain a transcription-enhancing function and
may also modulate DNA binding (3-5). Neither exon A nor
exons B and C are known to have any influence on ligand
binding.
In the ER and GR, it has been demonstrated that the
steroid-binding domain encompasses exons E-G and portions of exons D and H (23, 24). hAR exons E-G exhibit a
relatively high degree of similarity to hPR, hMR, and hGR
(Fig. 2). Although exon D is less homologous overall, a
23-amino acid region positioned near its 3' junction is highly
conserved among all nuclear receptors (10). Experimental
mutations within this region were found to interfere with
ligand binding, suggesting that it is part of a hydrophobic
ligand-binding pocket (23, 24, 34). Throughout exons D-G, a
variety of deletion and linker insertion mutations of the PR,

FIG. 2. Amino acid homology among steroid receptors compared by exons. The amino acid sequence of hAR (10) is compared by exon with
amino acid sequences of the hPR, hMR, hGR, and hER (refs. 3-5 and references therein and ref. 6). Indicated are the percent homologies with
hAR (boxed) and amino acid residue numbers (below boxes). Intron/exon splice sites are indicated by the vertical dashed lines. Amino acid
residue numbers of the splice sites of hAR (this report), hER (14), and the exon B splice sites of hMR (6) are known. hPR splice sites were derived
from sequence homology with the known splice sites of cPR (17). The splice sites of hGR and the remaining splice sites of hMR were derived
from sequence homology with hAR. Amino acid sequences of the predicted splice sites with the exception of the exon A/B sites were homologous
(data not shown). Percent homologies among the same exons of different receptors were calculated by the GAP program of the GCG sequence
analysis program (30).

FIG. 4. Partial pedigree of a family
with complete AIS and nucleotide sequence of the X chromosome-linked mutation. Solid squares indicate 46,XY genetic males with the complete AIS phenotype, open square with line indicates
the deceased father, and circle with dot
indicates the heterozygous mother. Abnormal AR sequence is shown on the left
and normal sequence is shown on the
right. A single base mutation (asterisk
and arrows) of G to A resulted in the only
identified amino acid sequence change in
this kindred. The mutation was found in
all amplified G exon clones from individuals 11-1, -2, and -3 and in two of the six
clones sequenced from 1-2. I-2, a heterozygous carrier, displayed the normal allele in the other four sequenced clones.

affinity for androgen was decreased.tt There was also a
relative increase in affinity for progesterone. Although hPR
has a leucine at the position corresponding to the AR point
mutation, cPR does contain a methionine, as do hGR and
hMR (Fig. 3). It is interesting to speculate that this region of
the G exon may be important in determining steroid-binding
specificity to AR. Estradiol has no increase in affinity for the
mutated AR (28), and its receptor has little homology with AR
in exon G (Figs. 2 and 3).
The exon G mutation has the potential of affecting both the
steroid-binding and transcription-activating functions of the
AR protein. Ligand binding to AR and other steroid hormone
receptors initiates a transformation process that results in
enhanced binding of receptors to their hormone response
elements (3-5). This process may involve a conformational
change in the receptor protein or separation from a nonsteroid-binding component that unmasks the DNA-binding
domain and a nuclear transfer sequence located in the Cterminal region downstream from the DNA-binding domain.
The process may also activate within the steroid-binding
domain a dimerization sequence shown to be required for
strong interaction of the steroid receptor with its response
element and for transactivation of gene expression (36, 37).
The mechanism by which this point mutation, resulting in
only a subtle change in steroid-binding properties of the AR,
could cause complete loss of AR functional activity is not yet
clear. However, it appears that complete transformation of
the receptor subsequent to steroid binding requires precise
structural interaction between receptor and ligand. Steroid
antagonists, for example, have recently been shown to bind
ERs and GRs and promote specific binding to hormone
response elements without enhancing gene transcription as
would a normal agonist (37, 38). Hormone-binding domains
of nuclear receptors are now recognized to have transcriptional enhancer effects (24, 38). A point mutation might
abolish this function without greatly affecting steroid binding.
Expression of this mutated hAR in vitro will allow further
studies to determine whether it is capable of binding to its
response element and enhancing transcription of a reporter
gene.
Present evidence suggests that there is a wide spectrum of
AR gene mutations causing androgen insensitivity syndrome
in humans (1, 2, 20, 21). Such androgen receptor mutations
are amenable to study by using the oligonucleotide primers
and the PCR method described here. This method of analysis,
by allowing correlations of AR structures with AIS phenotypes, should prove valuable in elucidating the mechanisms
of action of AR in male sex differentiation and development.
Note Added in Proof. After submission of this paper, we learned of
a publication (39) in which the structural organization of the hAR
gene was partially determined. Their locations for the hAR gene
splice sites are in agreement with the sites we have determined.

ttMore recently, we have recreated the natural mutation (amino acid
866, as shown in Fig. 3) in human AR cDNA by site-directed
mutagenesis and expressed the mutated and wild-type hAR cDNAs
in COS cells by a method previously described (7). Binding affinity
of the mutated AR for 3H-R1881 (a synthetic androgen) was
-4-fold lower than that of the wild-type AR (data not shown). This
difference in androgen-binding affinities is similar to that demonstrated earlier in cultured genital skin fibroblasts from normal
males and from siblings with AIS in this family (28).
