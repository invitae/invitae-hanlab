Abstrad
Li-Fraumeni
syndrome
is a rare autosomal
dominant
susceptibility
to a variety of cancers including
carcinomas
of the breast and the adrenal cortex,
tumors of brain and muscle tissue, and leukemias.
Affeded
individuals
develop cancer at a young age and
often
at multiple primary sites. A study has been
conduded
into the genetic basis of cancer in a
particular
Li-Fraumeni
syndrome
family. Examination
of
p53 as a candidate
susceptibility
gene revealed that, in
two
affeded
individuals,
there was an aberrant
larger
transcript
of 3.6 kilobases present in both tumor and
constitutional
material
in addition to the normal-sized
2.8-kilobase
transcript.
The additional
transcript
was
not found in three unaffeded
family members.
Si
nuclease mapping localized
the insertion toward the 5’
end of the p53 transcript
near exons 4 and 5, and
sequencing
revealed
a point mutation
in the splice
donor site of intron 4 in the germ-line
of the two
affeded
individuals,
which accounted
for the presence
of the larger transcript.
The same splicing mutation was
also deteded
in two obligate carriers and was not
found in two unaffeded
individuals.
As no mutations
were deteded
in exons 5-8 in either tumor examined,
the second p53 allele was most likely lost during
tumorigenesis
in both tumors. The demonstration
of a
germ-line
splicing mutation
in affeded
individuals
from a Li-Fraumeni
syndrome
family provides for a
novel mechanism
of p53 inadivation
not seen
previously
in other affeded
families, in whom the
mutations
have all been missense. This mutation
also
falls outside the region of the p53 gene commonly
mutated in Li-Fraumeni
syndrome,
being the most 5’
mutation
reported to date.

in a

lntrodudion
The most common
genetic
change
in human
cancer
appears to be mutation
of the tumor
suppressor
gene,
p53 (1 -3). p53 mutations
are primarily
missense,
commonly CpG transitions,
resulting
in an amino acid change
and an altered
protein.
Less common
are non-sense
mutations,
such as splice site mutations,
and frameshift
mutations,
the latter being due to insertions
and deletions
(3) which may not produce any protein at all. The p53
gene has been highly conserved
throughout
evolution.
The interspecies
regions of homology
are concentrated
into five conserved
blocks (I-V) (1 -4), and it is within
these conserved
blocks (particularly
II-V) that most of
the human cancer mutations
occur (1-3, 5).
Recently,
germ-line
mutations
of this gene have been
identified
in affected
members
of families
with LFS4 (3,
6, 7), predisposing
them to cancer. LFS is a familial cancer
syndrome
with affected
individuals
exhibiting
a spectrum
of cancers,
including
premenopausal
breast carcinomas,
soft tissue sarcomas,
brain tumors,
osteosarcomas,
leukemias,
and adrenocortical
carcinomas.
These cancers
have an early age of onset, and the development
of
multiple
primary tumors is common.
Segregation
analysis
of these tumors is consistent
with an autosomal
dominant
mode of inheritance
(8-10). The first documented
inherited p53 mutations
in LFS families were tightly clustered
in exon 7, codons
245-258,
within
conserved
block IV
(6, 7). It was later shown that the predisposing
mutations
in the p53 gene were not always restricted
to that specific
codon
cluster
(3, 11-13).
In one family,
the germ-line
p53 mutation
was a point mutation
at codon 1 33 in exon
5, within
conserved
block
II (12). Another
report
descnibed a single base deletion
at codon 307 in one family
and a point mutation
at codon
286 in another
family,
both mutations
being in exon 8 (1 3). Excepting
the single
base deletion
which leads to a premature
stop codon in
exon 10, all of these point mutations
cause nonconservative amino acid substitutions
in the protein
produced,
presumably
leading to a loss of function
or altered function ofthe
protein (1, 2).
A germ-line
p53 mutation
was detected
in a patient
with ependymoma,
a tumor
not usually associated
with
LFS, at codon
242, within
the “hotspot”
region
(14).
Studies of young patients
with second malignancies
(15)
and patients
with sarcoma
(16) have shown
germ-line
p53 mutations
in some individuals,
most commonly
in
the exon 7 hotspot
region, but also mutations
at codon
325 in exon 9 (15) and codon 282 in exon 8 (15, 16) and
a 1-bp insertion
in exon 6 (16), even though
these mdividuals do not necessarily
have a family history of malig-

nancy or a history that conforms
to the diagnostic
criteria
for LFS.
As the p53 protein
levels in LFS cells appear
to be
equivalent
to or lower than those in normal cells (6), it
seems likely that the LFS p53 mutations
result in proteins
that are functionally
distinct
from the more common
hsc7o-binding,
highly
expressed,
mutant
p53 proteins
which exert a transdominant
loss of function”
effect on
the wild-type
p53 protein
encoded
by the remaining
normal allele (1-3, 6, 17-22).
That is, although
the LFS
p53 mutations
yield abnormal
proteins,
functional
loss of
the second allele may still be necessary
for total mactivation of p53 function.
The p53 mutations
observed
in
LFS are not unique
to LFS. All of the germ-line
p53
mutations
reported
to date have also been observed
in
sporadic
tumors (3, 6, 7, 11-16).
We report
here the detection
of a germ-line
point
mutation
in the splice donor site of intron 4 in affected
family members
and obligate
carriers in one LFS family.
We have previously
shown that an adrenocortical
carcinoma occurring
in one family member
had overexpression of the retinoblastoma
susceptibility
gene (23). The
p53 splice site mutation
described
here results in the
retention
of intron 4 in the mature p53 mRNA, resulting
in a larger transcript.
This is the first report of a germ-line
splice site mutation
in p53 and is the most 5’ germ-line
p53 mutation
to date.
Results
Detection
of a Larger p53 Transcript.
In order to determine whether
p53 was involved
in the etiology
of the
cancer susceptibility
in this family (Fig. 1), we examined
the expression
of this gene in patient cells and tissues, in
parallel with sequencing
studies. Fig. 2A shows Northern
blot analysis
of p53 expression
in patient
IIIC’s breast
carcinoma,
IVB’s adrenocortical
carcinoma
and skin fibroblasts,
and peripheral
blood from IIIB, IVA, and IVG.
RNA from affected
individuals
IIIC and IVB exhibited
a
larger p53 transcript
of approximately
3.6 kb in addition
to a normal-sized
transcript
of 2.8 kb in both tumor and
constitutional
material.
Both transcripts
were present in
IlIC’s stromal fibroblasts
and IVB’s peripheral
blood (data
not shown).
Unaffected
individuals
IlIB, IVA, and IVG all

G

showed
only the normal-sized
transcript,
2.8 kb, as did
the control,
MRC-5
fibroblasts.
A summary
of the p53
transcript
data for all family members
examined
in this
study is given in Table 1 Because the larger p53 transcript
was present in both tumor material and the germ-line
of
two affected
individuals
tested,
we postulated
that it
represented
the underlying
genetic
lesion in this family.
Possibilities
for increased
transcript
size are gene rearrangement
or a splicing aberration
resulting in retention
of an intron
in the message.
No obvious
gene rearrangement
was observed
by restriction
analysis
and
Southern
hybridization
to the p53 cDNA probe (data not
shown).
Two introns,
namely
introns
4 and 10, are of
approximately
the right size, 755 bp and 920 bp, respectively, to account
for the size difference
in transcripts.5
Using a 3’ end-labeled
p53 cDNA,
we were able to
perform
Si nuclease
mapping
to localize the insertion
to
approximately
550 bp from the 5’ end of the p53 cDNA.
As can be seen in Fig. 2B, the control,
MRC-S
RNA,
showed
a single band of approximately
1 .8 kb upon
hybridization
and Si nuclease digestion,
representing
the
portion ofthe p53 transcript
identical
to the cDNA probe.
Hybridization
of IVB’s RNA to the labeled
p53 cDNA
probe and digestion
with 51 nuclease
produced
two
bands. The first band was identical
in size to that in the
control and represented
the normal-sized
p53 transcript.
The second band was approximately
550 bp in size and
represented
the larger transcript
digested
at the point of
insertion.
The location
of the insertion
toward the 5’ end
of the p53 transcript
indicates
that the likely insertion
point would
involve intron 4 rather than intron 10.
Sequence Analysis of p53. The sequence
analysis had
two main objectives:
to identify the mutation
responsible
for the larger transcript
and to determine
whether
this
family had any other germ-line
p53 mutations,
either in
exon 7, the previously
reported
location
of LFS mutations, or elsewhere
in the gene.
To determine
whether
the cause of the larger transcript
in the affected
individuals
was retention
of an intron, the
splice donor and acceptor
sites of introns 4 and 10 were

sequenced.
Fragments
representing
the introns
in their
entirety
were generated
from affected
individuals’
genomic DNA using primers
complementary
to the flanking
exonic
sequences
and the polymerase
chain reaction.
The fragments
were either
cloned
and sequenced
or
directly
sequenced.
In each case in which cloning of PCR
products
was used, sequencing
was carried
out on six
different
clones representing
separate
reactions.
These
precautions
were taken to guard against sequence
discrepancies
caused
by base misinconporations
by Taq
polymerase.
In all cases, both strands were sequenced.
The sequences
of both the splice donor
and splice
acceptor
sites of intron 10 were determined
to be wildtype in all clones sequenced,
by comparison
with the
published
sequences
(data not shown). The splice accepton site of intron 4 was also found to be wild-type
in all
clones (data not shown),
but the sequence
of the splice
donor site of intron 4 revealed
a base change of a guanine
to an adenine
at the -1 position
of the splice consensus
sequence
(Fig. 3; Table 2). This base change
was observed in both tumor (Fig. 3, A and B) and fibroblast
DNA
(data not shown)
from the probands
IIIC and IVB and
also in peripheral
blood DNA from obligate
carriers
IVE
and VB (Fig. 3C), the father and identical
twin of VA,
respectively
(see Fig. 1 ). The base change was not found
in peripheral
blood
DNA sequenced
from unaffected
individuals,
IIIB or IVA (data not shown).
In IIIC’s tumor
DNA,
sequenced
directly,
both adenine
and guanine
were present at the -1 position
in the splice consensus
sequence
(Fig. 3B). Table 1 summarizes
the sequencing
results obtained
for the 5’ splice site of intron 4 in family
members.
The base change was observed
in five of six
clones derived
from IVB’s tumor
DNA, and one clone
was wild-type.
In IVB’s fibroblast
DNA, 50% of clones
had the mutated
base, and 50% had the wild-type

prediction

mutation.

Consti-

tutional
DNAs
from other individuals
(IlIC’s fibroblast
DNA and IVE and VB peripheral
blood DNA) were also
heterozygous
for the mutation.
To address the question
of the involvement
of previously reported
LFS mutations,
an exon 7 fragment
was
generated
by PCR from genomic
DNA, and both strands
were sequenced
directly.
No point mutations
were detected in exon 7 in tumor or peripheral
blood DNA from
probands
IIIC and IVB, or in peripheral
blood DNA from
obligate
carriers IVE and VB or unaffected
individual
IlIB
(Table 1). In addition,
fragments
representing
exons 5-8
were generated
by PCR from IIIC’s and IVB’s tumor DNA
and sequenced
directly.
No point mutations
were ob-

served apart from the intron 4 splice site mutation
(Tables
1 and 2). This lack of another
point mutation
in the p53
hotspot regions makes it more likely that the inactivation
of the remaining
wild-type
p53 alleles in tumonigenesis
has occurred
by loss rather than mutation
in the case of
IVB’s tumor.
It is possible
that the inactivation
of the
wild-type
p53 allele in IIIC’s tumor
was caused
by a
mutation
in the regions of the p53 gene that were not
sequenced
in this study, that is, exons 1 -4 and 9-1 1.
These regions
are less frequently
mutated
in human
tumors than exons 5-8 (1 -3, 5).
Discussion
The involvement
of p53 in the genetics
of LFS has been
previously
demonstrated
(3, 6, 7, 1 1 -1 3). We have analyzed the expression
of p53 in certain
members
of an
LFS family, and observed
the presence
of a 3.6-kb transcript, in addition
to the normal-sized
2.8-kb transcript.
The larger transcript
was observed
in the RNA of tumor
and fibroblast
material from two individuals,
IIIC and IVB,
and was therefore
germ-line.
Only the normal-sized
transcript was found
in peripheral
blood
RNA from unaffected individuals,
IIIB, IVA, and IVG. We considered
the
most likely cause ofthe aberrant transcript
to be a splicing
mutation
resulting
in the retention
of all or part of an
intron in the mature
mRNA.
Although
missense
point
mutations
are by far the most common
mutation
in the
p53 gene, splicing mutations
have been reported
in sporadic tumors.
They have been mostly detected
in lung
carcinomas
in introns 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9 (3, 24-27)
and in
leukemias
in introns 4 and S (3, 28, 29).
Based on size, the most likely introns to be included
in the larger transcript
were 4 and 10. Evidence
from 51
nuclease
mapping
indicated
that intron 4 was present in
the message. PCR and sequencing
confirmed
that intron
4 had a point mutation
in the splice donor site in both
affected
individuals
IIIC and IVB’s tumor and fibroblast
DNA. These were the individuals
in which
the 3.6-kb
transcript
was detected.
Upon sequencing
other family
members,
we found
the same point
mutation
in the
peripheral
blood DNA from obligate
carriers IVE and VB.
In peripheral
blood
DNA from unaffected
individuals,
IIIB and IVA, the sequence
for intron 4 and surrounding
sequence
was wild-type.
The mutation
was a guanine
to adenine
transition
at
position -1 in the splice donor consensus
sequence.
This
base is nonessential
for splicing to occur, unlike the CT
dinucleotide,
the first two bases of the intron (30). But

In B, IIIC’s

base, guanine,

in a similar
proportion
to the mutant
base, adenine.
This sequence
was derived
directly
from six pooled
PCR samples.
In C, peripheral
blood
DNA
from obligate
carriers,

and VB, shows
both the guanine
and the adenine
in approximately
equal
intensities.
This sequence
was also derived
from six pooled

the intron
4 splice
donor
sequence
of p53 is atypical,
having a cytosine
at position
3 ofthe

of an adenine
or a guanine.
This means
that the
wild-type
intron

donor
site has only
seven
of
nine bases matching
the consensus
sequence.
With
the
guanine

is decreased
to six of nine
bases,
which
is probably

Loss

also have occurred
by mutation
of the wild-type
p53 in

In
the tumor material
from IVB, which was sequenced
after
cloning,
five of six clones had the mutant base, adenine,

a probable
loss of the wild-type
p53 allele in
the tumor and stromal tissue infiltration
causing the low
background
of wild-type
sequence,
whereas
the mutant
p53 allele remained
present.
Another
alternative
to explain the presence
of a lower
amount
of wild-type
transcript
in IVB’s tumor
is a gene
dosage effect caused by the copy numbers
of chromosome 1 7, the chromosome
to which
the p53 gene is
localized
(31-33).
IVB’s tumor
has three copies of chromosome

then

mutation

in this study.
This is the first report of an inherited
splicing mutation
in the p53 gene. This mutation
lies in conserved
block II,
upstream
of the exon S (conserved
block II also) mutation
reported
in a LFS family (12), and represents
the most 5’
LFS mutation

reported

to date

(Fig.

4). It is interesting

to

note that although
LFS families
show a diverse range of
tumors,
not all families develop
all of the hallmark
types
of tumors.
For example,
in the LFS family reported
here,
there have been no documented
soft tissue sarcomas
in
the five generations
shown (Fig. 1), but there have been
two cases of adrenocortical
carcinoma
in the one family.
In other families,
there are no adrenocortical
carcinomas
but a preponderance
of soft tissue sarcomas
(6-8). Pos-

and Methods

Family Studies. The pedigree of the family examined
in
this study is given in Fig. 1 The probands
were IIIC and
IVB. IIlC’s first tumor was an adrenocortical
carcinoma
followed
by premenopausal
breast carcinoma,
and her
son IVB also had an adrenocortical
carcinoma.
Adrenocontical
carcinoma
is a rare tumor which occurs
more frequently
in LFS families than it does in the general
population
(9, 10, 13, 34, 35). From discussions
with
family members
and, where possible,
by confirmation
of
hospital
records, the pedigree
spanning
five generations
was compiled.
The types of tumors,
the ages of onset,
and the inheritance
pattern
in this family are consistent
with the diagnostic
criteria
for the LFS cancer
family
syndrome
(8-10).
The clinical
histories
of the two probands, IIIC and IVB, have been described
in a previous
publication
(23). The inheritance
appears
to stem from
the maternal
side of the family,
beginning
with IIIC’s
grandfather,
IE, who died in his thirties
from leukemia,
although
it has not been possible
to confirm
this by
examination
of archival
pathology
material.
The contnibution of the paternal
relatives of individual
IVB (that is,
relatives
of IIIC’s husband,
IlIB) to IVB’s cancer predisposition
is not known. The types of tumors and their ages
of onset are not consistent
with LFS.
Tumors and Cell Culture. The tissues used for analysis
were as follows.
A breast carcinoma
from IIIC (23) and
an adrenocortical
carcinoma
from IVB (23) were received
as surgical
specimens
and processed
immediately
for
DNA and/or
RNA as described
below.
Peripheral
blood
was obtained
from IIIB, IVA, IVB, IVE, IVG, and VB. The
cell lines/strains
used were:
IIIC’s stromal
fibroblasts,
IVB’s skin fibroblasts,
MRC-S
human
embryonic
lung
fibroblasts
(36), and SW-13 human adrenocortical
adenocarcinoma
cells (37). IlIC and IVB’s fibroblasts
were
cultured
in RPMI 1640 medium.
MRC-S fibroblasts
were
maintained
in Dulbecco’s
modified
Eagle’s medium,
and
SW-i 3 cells were kept in L-1 S medium.
MRC-S and SW13 cells were obtained
from the American
Type Culture
Collection.
All media were supplemented
with 10% fetal

DNA and RNA Isolation.
Lymphocytes
for DNA and/
or RNA were obtained
from peripheral
blood samples by
separation
on a Ficoll-Hypaque
(Phanmacia)
density gradient. Total RNA and/on genomic
DNA was isolated
by
gently homogenizing
minced tumor tissue in guanidmnium
isothiocyanate
or by lysing cultured
cells or lymphocytes
in guanidmnium
isothiocyanate
(38), followed
by separation on a cesium chloride
gradient
(38). Cenomic
DNA
without
RNA was isolated
by standard
techniques.
Northern
Analysis
and Si Nuclease Mapping.
In general, for Northern
analysis,
10-jag samples
of total RNA
were size fractionated
by agarose gel electrophoresis
in
the presence of formaldehyde,
transferred
to nylon membranes, and hybridized
to the p53 cDNA probe labeled
with [a-32P]dCTP.
The p53 probe used in this study was
a 1.8-kb Xbal fragment
gel purified
from the plasmid
pLSVhpS3c62
(39) and labeled
by random
priming
(40).
All hybridizations
were carried out at 42#{176}C
in 50% formamide. The 51 nuclease
mapping
was carried out using
standard
techniques
(38). Total RNA from the affected
individual
on control
was hybridized
to the p53 cDNA.
The same Xbal fragment
of pLSVhpS3c62
was used,
except that it was labeled by 3’ end labeling with [a-32P]
dCTP (38). The molecular
size markers
used were the
fragments
generated
from a Hint) digest of pBR322,
5’
end labeled with [‘y-32P}dATP
(38). Reactions
were analyzed on denaturing
5% polyacrylamide
gels containing
8 M urea. Both Northern
blots and Si nuclease
gels were
visualized
by autoradiography.
PCR and Sequencing
Analysis. The PCR primers used
are summarized
in Table 3. For PCR amplification,
in
general,
genomic
DNA (0.5 jag) was incubated
in a total
volume
of 50 jal of solution
containing
SO mt’i KCI, 10
mM Tnis-CI (pH 8.3), 1.5 mti MgCI2,
200 jaM each of the
four deoxynibonucleotides,
200 pmol
oligonucleotide
primers,
and 3.75 units of AmpliTaq
DNA polymerase
(Perkin-Elmer
Cetus). For PCR of introns 4 and 10, templates were denatured
at 95#{176}C
for 1 mm 20 s, followed

cloning.

by 35 cycles of PCR with 2 mm of primer annealing
at
70#{176}C,
3 mm of extension
at 72#{176}C,
and 1 mm of denaturation at 94#{176}C.
The intron 4 and 10 PCR products
were
then cloned
into pCEM-3Z
and sequenced
using the
Sanger dideoxy
chain termination
method
(41), modified
for sequencing
close to the primers,
using the PCR
primers as sequencing
primers.
The intron 4 and 10 PCR
products
were sequenced
by one of two strategies.
Either
six PCR reactions
were cloned and sequenced
separately
or, alternatively,
six PCR reactions
were pooled
and
sequenced
directly
using the fmol Cycle Sequencing
Kit
(Promega
Corp.). For PCR of exons 5-8, primers for both
PCR and sequencing
and the PCR protocol
were as
described
(42, 43). In all cases, six PCR reactions
were
pooled,
and PCR products
were separated
by agarose
gel electrophoresis,
then purified
from the agarose
by
