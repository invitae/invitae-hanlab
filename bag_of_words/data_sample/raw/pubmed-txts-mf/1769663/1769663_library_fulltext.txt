We have analyzed /3-thalassemia
(&thal)
alleles in the
Mestizo population
of Mexico (Ibarra et al., 1968). These
individuals
are of a mixed racial background, including that
of Spanish and Portuguese settlers and the native peoples.
The natives were presumably
derived from Asiatic roots.
Nineteen fl-thal alleles were analyzed in 13 patients: 6 patients had fl-thal major, 4 patients had P-thal trait, and 3
patients had ps and P-thal alleles. The B-globin gene region
was amplified by PCR (Wong et al., 1987); the PCR products were subjected to dot-blot hybridization,
analyzed for
internal deletions, or directly sequenced when no known
alleles were found (Boehm and Kazazian,
1989). Southern
blot analysis was carried out to detect large fl-globin cluster
deletions and a-globin deletions producing
a-thalassemia.
Table 1 presents the alleles found; 16 fl-thalassemia
alleles
were identified, whereas 3 remained unidentified
even after
sequencing of the entire fi-globin gene, the 3’ enhancer, and
500 bp 5’ to the fl-globin gene.
A number of interesting
observations
were made. First,
the molecular basis of /3-thalassemia in the Mestizo Mexicans is very heterogeneous
(Ibarra et al., 1966). Eight different alleles were found among 16 @-thalassemia genes identified. Second, two alleles previously concentrated
in Asian
Indians, the 619-bp deletion and IVS 1, nucleotide
(nt)
5(G-C), were each represented
twice in this population.
One patient carrying a common Asian Indian allele and a
common Mediterranean
allele (619-bp deletion plus nonsense codon 39) was found. The IVS 1, nt 5(G-C) mutation
in Mexicans
was found on the same p-gene framework
(framework
3A) as it is in Asian Indians (Kazazian
et al.,
1984), suggesting its origin in this population
by gene migration. Whether this gene migration was recent or ancient
is not clear. Third, two alleles clearly indigenous
to the
Mestizos were found. One, a -1 deletion (-T) from codon
11 of the fl-globin gene, is novel; the second, -28 (A-C), has
been seen previously
only in Kurdish
Jews (Poncz et al.,
1986). Because the P-gene framework for the allele in Kurdish Jews and Mestizos is identical (framework
l), a second
origin of this latter mutation
in Mestizos is difficult to
prove. However, because this allele has been seen previously only in Kurdish Jews, a small genetic isolate (Rund et
al., 1991), a new origin for the mutation
in Mestizos is
likely. The reason for the high fraction of unknown B-thalGENOMICS

assemia mutations in this population
(3 of 19) is unknown,
but perhaps one allele accounts for all of these unknowns.
In our analysis of other regions of the /3-globin cluster in
the patients with unknown
mutations, we studied the pand @*-promoter regions. In this analysis, a deletion of A at
-225 or -226 to the DA-globin cap site was found in presumed normal chromosomes as a polymorphism
in this population. For example, /3-thalassemia trait individuals carrying nonsense codon 39 alleles were observed with the A
deletion on their normal DA-bearing chromosome,
as documented by haplotype analysis of families. The frequency of
this polymorphism
in other ethnic groups has not been determined.
