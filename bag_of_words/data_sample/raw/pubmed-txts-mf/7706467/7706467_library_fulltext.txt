phoprotein that functions as a negative regulator of cell proliferation (3, 4). p53 is a transcription activating factor that acts as
a "checkpoint" control late in GI to block the progression of
cells through the cell cycle, particularly in the presence of DNA
damage (5-9).
Alterations of the p53 gene or its encoded protein are the
most common genetic abnormalities observed in human cancers
(10, 11), having been associated with virtually every sporadically occurring malignancy ( 12, 13 ). The presence of heterozygous p53 mutations in an individual's constitutional cells confers a high risk for the development of a diverse set of malignancies (14). Such germline p53 mutations were initially identified
in affected members of families with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome
(LFS)' ( 15, 16). This autosomal, dominantly inherited disorder
is characterized by the presence of soft tissue and osteosarcomas, early onset breast cancers, adrenocortical carcinomas,
brain tumors, and acute leukemias in affected family members
( 17-20). Other features of LFS include the early age at diagnosis of tumors and the propensity of affected individuals to develop multiple primary tumors (14, 19, 20). The relationship
between LFS and constitutional p53 mutations is complex. Although the majority of LFS families analyzed to date harbor
germline p53 mutations in the coding region of the gene ( 15,
16, 21, 22), some LFS families lack detectable mutations (23,
24), and constitutional mutations have been identified in some
cancer patients without a family history of malignancy
(25-31).
The presence of a childhood sarcoma is the primary criterion
for the diagnosis of LFS. In addition, despite potential bias
through ascertainment methods, rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is
the most frequently diagnosed sarcoma in this syndrome. Based
on these observations, we elected to study a series of unselected
pediatric RMS patients from two large institutions in order to
determine the frequency of constitutional p53 mutations in this
population and to correlate these findings with any distinct characteristics of these patients or their tumors. We chose to study
patients who do not have family histories suggestive of a cancerpredisposing syndrome, so that the frequency of constitutional
p53 mutations in patients with apparently sporadic disease could
be assessed.
Genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes of children with RMS was screened using PCR and singlestrand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. All coding exons of the gene were analyzed. Those samples that showed
altered electrophoretic mobility compared with the wild-type
controls were further analyzed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing to characterize the alterations. The results of this analysis

Abstract
We investigated the possibility that a proportion of children
with sporadic rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) carry constitutional mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. 33 patients with sporadic RMS at two large outpatient pediatric
oncology clinics submitted blood samples. Genomic DNA
was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and PCR
was used to amplify exons 2-11 of the p53 gene. Amplified
genomic DNA was screened for the presence of germline p53
mutations using single-strand conformation polymorphism
(SSCP) analysis. The DNA sequence of those samples that
showed aberrant migration of bands on SSCP analysis was
determined to identify the precise nature of the gene mutations. Patient records were reviewed to assess clinical correlates of the mutant p53 carrier state. Heterozygous constitutional mutations were detected in 3/33 patient samples
screened. Two of these missense mutations are located in
exon 7 and one in exon 8 of the p53 gene. The presence of
mutations was not correlated with tumor histology, stage,
or site. However, an association between young age at diagnosis and presence of a constitutional p53 mutation was
noted: 3/13 children under the age of 3 yr at diagnosis
carried mutations, whereas none of 20 children over 3 yr of
age at diagnosis harbored a detectable constitutional mutation. These results in children with RMS corroborates previous findings in other clinical settings suggesting that the
mutant p53 carrier state may predispose individuals to malignancy at an early age. Although this study did not assess
whether the mutations were preexisting or new germline
alterations, assessment of close relatives of RMS patients
for cancer risk and predictive genetic testing may be indicated. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 95:1606-1611.) Key words: LiFraumeni syndrome rhabdomyosarcoma * p53 tumor suppressor gene germline mutation

Methods

Results
Clinical characteristics ofpatients. 36 children with RMS or a
history of RMS were seen at the two centers during the study
period. Three patients were ineligible for the study: one had a
family history consistent with LFS, one had a first-degree relative with cancer, and one carried a coincident clinical diagnosis
of neurofibromatosis type 1. 33 patients were therefore entered
into the study; family history and clinical history for all 33
revealed no LFS, no first-degree relative with cancer, no history
of neurofibromatosis, and no history of second cancers. The
clinical data for all 33 participants screened are outlined in
Table I. The mean age at diagnosis of RMS was 60.1 mo (range
6 mo to 18 yr). There were 12 females and 21 males. Primary
sites of origin are 11 genitourinary system, 8 head and neck, 4
orbital, 8 extremity, 1 abdominal, and 1 arising from the diaphragm. Histologic subtype was embryonal in 20 patients, alveolar in 11 patients, and mixed or undifferentiated in 2 patients.
Clinical groups were determined according to the criteria of
the International Rhabdomyosarcoma Study IV (32) and are
outlined for each patient in Table I.

Patient selection and clinical data. Informed consent was obtained from
the parents of all eligible minor patients ( < 18 yr of age) and all eligible
patients who were now adults. In addition, minor patients above age 12
yr gave consent after an explanation of the study. Patients with RMS,
or a history of RMS, seen consecutively in the outpatient pediatric
oncology clinics at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, MA, or
The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Ontario, were asked to
participate in the study. Those patients with LFS, neurofibromatosis,
second cancers, or a first-degree relative with cancer were excluded.
The study group included newly diagnosed patients, patients on active
treatment, and those in long-term follow-up. Age at diagnosis, sex,
tumor histology (alveolar, embryonal), tumor site, grade (32), and
current clinical outcome were obtained and recorded for each patient.

proportion of patients with RMS are genetically susceptible to
the development of the tumor. In 1969, Li and Fraumeni first
defined an increased risk of cancers, especially breast cancer,
in the relatives of patients with RMS (17, 18). Subsequent
studies of RMS patients and their families have revealed an
increased relative risk of early onset breast cancer in mothers
of patients with RMS (37). This association has not been seen
consistently in mothers of other childhood cancer patients. RMS
is one of the tumors observed as a second cancer in survivors
of childhood cancer (38) and is the most common sarcoma
described in LFS (19, 20). A study of RMS tumor samples
revealed a high frequency of alterations at the p53 tumor suppressor locus (39, 40). The current study provides genetic evidence that RMS, in a subset of patients, is associated with the
carrier state of a constitutionally altered allele of the p53 tumor
suppressor gene.
Previous surveys have sought to identify the clinical situations associated with increased risk of harboring a germline p53

mutation. Among families with LFS, the risk of carriage of a
constitutional p53 mutation has been variable among studies.
Initially, it had been demonstrated that 5/5 families with classic
LFS harbored mutations (15 ), yet subsequent studies have been
able to demonstrate mutations only in 70% of LFS families (14,
22, 23, 25, 41). Toguchida et al. (26) analyzed the entire coding
sequence of the p53 gene in 196 sarcoma patients of all ages,
most of whom had osteosarcoma. 15 of these patients were
specifically recruited to the study because of an unusual family
history of cancer. Eight individuals with germline p53 mutations
were found, although only two of these were patients without
an unusual family history of cancer. The authors did not note
whether a tendency to early onset of disease in the mutant p53
carriers existed. Among women with breast cancer, germline
p53 mutations have been reported to be rare, with Sidransky et
al. and B0rresen et al. finding only 2/337 women carrying
mutations (29, 30). Of children and young adults who develop
second malignant neoplasms after surviving childhood cancer,

4/59 harbored germline p53 mutations. Adrenocortical carcinoma, an extremely rare tumor of childhood except in the setting
of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or LFS, has been associated
with the p53 carrier state in 3/6 children studied (42). None
of these individuals had a family history of cancer. In another
survey, 2/6 children with adenocortical carcinoma in LFS families harbored germline p53 mutations (43). A survey of individuals with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia revealed 1
carrier of a germline p53 mutation among 25 patients studied
(44). A recent survey of 235 unselected children with osteosarcoma found 7 (2.5%) who harbored mutations (45). Three of
these children have no family history of cancer. In summary,
the risk of carriage of a p53 mutation for a cancer patient
without a strong family history of malignancy, a second cancer,
or adrenocortical carcinoma is very low.
We report here that 3/33 children (9.1%) with RMS without
a family history of cancer or second cancers harbor constitutional p53 mutations. This represents the highest proportion of
patients to be described to date, except those with adrenocortical
carcinoma who carry mutations but who have no suggestive
family history or second cancers. All mutations were missense
and predict amino acid substitutions. Gender, tumor site, histology, and clinical group showed no correlation with the presence
or absence of mutations. However, 3/13 children (23%) diagnosed before the age of 3 yr carried p53 mutations, whereas 0/
20 children 3 yr or older at diagnosis harbored mutations. The
association between young age at diagnosis and genetic predisposition has been observed in other settings, such as in retino-

Characteristics of germline p53 mutations in three patients harboring

gene from DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of

the patient's sample as compared with flanking wild-type controls.
The presence of this shift is highly suggestive of a sequence alteration within the amplified gene fragment. (b) DNA sequence of

blastoma and Wilms' tumor (46, 47). A larger sample size
may allow stronger correlations between clinical and biologic
factors, as well as a more stable estimation of frequency of
mutations; however, the concepts that patients with RMS are
at risk for p53 mutations and that a negative family history for
malignancy does not eliminate this risk have been established
by this study.
The three mutations found have been previously described
in somatic tumor tissue, but not in constitutional samples (13,
22). Of interest, one of the three patients was noted to have an
alveolar RMS, a tumor associated with a nonrandom chromosomal translocation, t(2;13) (48). The fact that this patient
carried a p53 mutation suggests that tumorigenesis of alveolar
RMS is a multistep process that may be associated with genetic
alterations beyond the characteristic translocation.
This study was designed as a survey, rather than a screening
and predictive testing analysis. Thus, we did not examine the
parents or siblings of the RMS patients for p53 mutations and
are therefore unable to assess the rate of de novo versus inherited mutations in this group. It is possible that family members
of those children found to harbor mutations may be carriers
who have not, as yet, manifested disease. Because predictive
testing of unaffected relatives has specific medical, social, and
ethical implications, this screening is being carried out within
the setting of carefully monitored genetic counselling-based
studies at both participating institutions, for those family members who desire it.
Children with RMS who were not found to harbor germline
p53 gene mutations in this series may yet have a genetically
based increased risk for malignancy. Because SSCP is a technique with < 100% sensitivity, it is likely that not all p53
mutations were detected in the patient DNA samples. Some
patients may carry wild-type p53 alleles, but inherit a predisposition for the development of cancer through a different gene
or through a mechanism that functionally inactivates wild-type
P53 protein. Such a scenario has been described in a patient
from an LFS family who had no identifiable p53 gene mutation,
but who demonstrated increased immunostaining of P53 protein
in constitutional cells, suggesting abnormal stabilization of the
protein (24). Other candidate genes for RMS predisposition
would include the murine double minute gene, mdm-2, which
Germline p53 Mutations in Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma

encodes a protein that complexes with P53 and may inhibit its
function (49, 50). In fact, MDM-2 has been shown to be amplified or overexpressed in some sarcoma subtypes (50-52). Finally, children with RMS may also develop their disease as a
consequence of alterations of other cancer-associated genes
such as the neurofibromatosis-1 gene.
The previously observed finding of early onset RMS in LFS
families together with the relatively high frequency of germline
p53 mutations in early onset RMS observed in this cohort suggests a broader definition of LFS, as well as possible biologic
differences between childhood RMS of early and late onset.
These observations may in turn lead to novel therapeutic approaches to childhood RMS and could influence the clinical
management of RMS survivors and family members.
