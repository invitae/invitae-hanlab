Summary. A c o m m o n mutation within the CYP17 gene
that causes 17ct-hydroxylase deficiency, a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, has been found by direct
sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments of genomic D N A from six families residing in the
Friesland region of the Netherlands. The mutation is a 4base duplication within exon 8 of the CYP17 gene, which
alters the reading frame encoding the C-terminal 26 amino
acids of cytochrome P45017m This mutation has previously been found in two Canadian patients who are m e m bers of ostensibly unrelated Mennonite families. The
Mennonite Churches derive their name from Menno Simons, an early leader of the sect in Friesland. Presumably this 4-base duplication appeared within the Friesian
population prior to emigration of the Mennonites from
the Netherlands.

marized (Yanase et al. 1991). In this article, we report
the molecular basis of the disease in five families (seven
patients), each of which contained a homozygous 4-base
duplication in exon 8 of CYP17 (Nebert et al. 1991), as
determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and direct sequencing. An additional individual has
the same 4-base duplication in one CYP17 allele. These
patients live in a limited area (Friesland) of the Netherlands and the mutation is the same as previously reported for two Canadian patients (Kagimoto et al. 1988, 1989;
Winter et al. 1989) who are m e m b e r s of the Mennonite
religious sect, which derives its name from a religious
leader who lived in this same region of the Netherlands
in the sixteenth century.

Materials and methods
Introduction
A relatively rare cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia,
17a-hydroxylase (P45017~) deficiency was first recognized
by Bigliere et al. (1966). Complete deficiency of 17ahydroxylase activities results in the absence of synthesis
of cortisol, leading to a compensatory hypersecretion
of A C T H . As a result, deoxycorticosterone secretion
is m a r k e d l y increased, resulting in hypertension and
hypokalemia, while increased corticosterone production
compensates for the decreased cortisol synthesis. Since
P45017~ also catalyzes the 17,20-1yase reaction leading
to the production of C19 androgen precursors to sex hormones, 46XY infants lacking this activity are born with
external genitalia that are entirely female, and at puberty, in both 46XY and 46XX individuals, there is no secretion of gonadal hormones, the patients remaining
sexually infantile. The inheritance of the disease is autosomal recessive and recently the molecular basis of 17ahydroxylase deficiency in several patients has been sumOffprint requests to." M. R. Waterman

Representing six families all living in Friesland, the Netherlands,
we studied eight patients. Five are 46XY (four female phenotype,
one male phenotype) and three are 46XX. All are diagnosed as
examples of complete 17n-hydroxylase/17,20-1yase deficiency except the male 46XY individual, who has been diagnosed as having
partial 17a-hydroxylase/17,20-1yase deficiency with impaired virilization (de Lange and Doorenbos 1990). The clinical features of
one of the female patients have also been reported (de Lange et al.
1973). Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood cells
from each individual. Oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) primers were designed to divide the CYP17 gene (8 exons)
to 4 sections. Primers used to cover a 1029-bp segment containing
exons 7 and 8 including the mutation described herein were one
complementary to sequences in intron 6 (5'-GAGCAAGGAAGGGAGTACGA-3') and one complementary to sequences in the
3'-untranslated region of CYP17 (5'-GGTI'GTATCTCTAAATCTGT-3'; Fig. 1A). The PCR was performed using 1 lag genomic
DNA according to Saiki et al. (1988). PCR products were purified
by electrophoresis and recovered by freeze and squeeze using glass
beads and dissolved in 20 lal of TE buffer. Asymmetrical PCR was
then performed using 2111of the purified symmetrical PCR product
according to Gyllensten and Erlich (1988). Excess primer and
dNTPs were removed by using a Centricon 30 (Amicon, Beverly,
Mass.), and the reaction products were concentrated by ethanol
precipitation. DNA sequence was determined according to Sanger
et al. (1977).
