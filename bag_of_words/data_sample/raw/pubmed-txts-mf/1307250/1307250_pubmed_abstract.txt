The androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a disorder of male sexual development resulting in a wide range of clinical phenotypes. AIS is classified into two phenotypic forms: complete (CAIS) and partial (PAIS). To determine the molecular basis of the phenotypic diversity in AIS, we have studied 27 subjects (13 CAIS, 14 PAIS), spanning the full range of AIS phenotypes. We report the results of a mutation screen of the androgen receptor gene. The coding regions of the gene were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and screened for single strand conformation polymorphisms to identify mutations. This was followed by DNA sequencing of putative mutant segments. Androgen receptor gene mutations were identified in nine CAIS and five PAIS subjects. Two of the CAIS mutations in exon A resulted in frameshifts. A third CAIS mutation resulted in the deletion of a single amino acid from the ligand binding domain of the receptor. All other mutations caused single amino acid substitutions in the ligand binding domain. These results suggest that mutations affecting the ligand binding domain of the androgen receptor are the most frequent cause of AIS, although some cases of PAIS may be the result of other, as yet undefined, genetic lesions.
