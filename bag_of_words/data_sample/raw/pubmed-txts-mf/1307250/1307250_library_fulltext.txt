ABSTRACT

INTRODUCTION
Androgens are responsible for many aspects of male sexual
development, in foetal life and later at puberty (1). The two
principal androgens are testosterone and its reduced derivative,
5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). These hormones have distinct
roles in sexual development, although their effects are mediated
by a single androgen receptor, a member of the steroid/thyroid
receptor superfamily (2). The androgen receptor combines with
androgen within the cell and is activated, a process involving
the dissociation of the receptor from a large multiprotein complex.
The activated receptor then binds to specific chromosomal DNA
target sites designated androgen response elements, leading to
modulation of transcription of adjacent genes (3).
Like other members of the receptor superfamily, the androgen
receptor protein (919 amino acids) is divided into three distinct
functional domains: the C-terminal 250 amino acids are
responsible for androgen binding, the central domain consists of
two zinc finger-like elements responsible for DNA binding, and
die less well characterised N-terminal domain has a role in

transcriptional activation by the receptor (4, 5). A recently defined
domain adjacent to the DNA binding domain is responsible for
nuclear localisation of the androgen receptor (4, 5). Based on
sequence homology with the oestrogen receptor, a subdomain
within the Iigand binding domain of the androgen receptor has
been proposed to be involved in receptor dimerisation (6).
The androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) results from a
defective cellular response to androgen, and has an X-linked
recessive mode of inheritance (7,8). Affected males have a 46XY
karyotype and are able to synthesise and metabolise androgen
normally. A wide range of phenotypes is associated with AIS.
The most severe form, the complete androgen insensitivity
syndrome (CAIS), results in a total lack of virilisation, and thus
a normal female appearance at birth. If the condition is not
diagnosed at birth or in infancy, individuals may present at
puberty or in later life with primary amenorrhcea. Often however,
the insensitivity is incomplete and results in the partial androgen
insensitivity syndrome (PAIS). PAIS usually presents at birth
when an infant is born with ambiguous genitalia. The genital ia
may appear male but with abnormalities such as cryptorchidism,
micropenis and hypospadias. Alternatively, the appearance may
be essentially female, but with evidence of virilisation such as
clitoromegaly and labial fusion. It has been suggested diat
unexplained infertility in an otherwise phenotypically normal male
may also represent a mild manifestation of PAIS (9-11).
The first indication that the androgen receptor itself is defective
in androgen insensitivity came from androgen' binding studies
on genital skin fibroblast cell lines from AIS subjects (12, 13).
Absent or profoundly defective androgen binding is observed in
the majority of CAIS cases, suggesting a severe deficit in
androgen receptor function. Since the isolation of the androgen
receptor gene (14, 15), a variety of mutations have been identified
in such cases which disrupt the receptor Iigand binding domain
(16). Occasionally, CAIS subjects are found who have normal
androgen binding and, in these cases androgen receptor gene
mutations have been identified in the DNA binding domain (17,
18). Collectively, the data at present suggest that mutations in
the androgen receptor gene are the only cause of CAIS.
By contrast, in PAIS cases, less profound qualitative androgen
binding defects such as reduced binding affinity and
thermolability, or a quantitative reduction in androgen binding
may be found (16, 19). These less pronounced binding defects

The androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a disorder of
male sexual development resulting in a wide range of clinical
phenotypes. AIS is classified into two phenotypic forms:
complete (CMS) and partial (PAIS). To determine the
molecular basis of the phenotypic diversity in AIS, we have
studied 27 subjects (13 CAIS, 14 PAIS), spanning the full
range of AIS phenotypes. We report the results of a mutation
screen of the androgen receptor gene. The coding regions of
the gene were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and
screened for single strand conformation polymorphisms to
identify mutations. This was followed by DNA sequencing of
putative mutant segments. Androgen receptor gene mutations
were identified hi nine CAIS and five PAIS subjects. Two
of the CAIS mutations in exon A resulted in frameshlfts. A
third CAIS mutation resulted in the deletion of a single amino
add from the Iigand binding domain of the receptor. All other
mutations caused single amino add substitutions in the Iigand
binding domain. These results suggest that mutations affecting
the Iigand binding domain of the androgen receptor are the
most frequent cause of AIS, although some cases of PAIS may
be the result of other, as yet undefined, genetic lesions.

are consistent with the less severe undervirilisation in PAIS
compared to CAIS. Androgen receptor gene mutations have also
been identified in PAIS (8, 16). However, a large number of
PAIS cases show normal androgen binding. In some instances
DNA binding defects in the androgen receptor may be the cause
of the phenotype (20). It is also possible that androgen binding
defects may be present, but are too subtle to be detected by
binding assays. This explanation could be tested by direct
screening of such cases for androgen receptor gene mutations.
We report here a study of 27 AIS subjects (13 CAIS, 14 PAIS).
The aims of the study were to determine whether androgen
receptor defects are the sole determinants of the AIS phenotype,
and to investigate the molecular basis for the phenotypic diversity
encountered in AIS. The androgen receptor gene was screened
for mutations using single strand conformation polymorphism
analysis (SSCP) (21). In this way mutations have been identified
in fourteen of the subjects. Nine of the mutations were found
in CAIS and five in PAIS subjects.
RESULTS
Androgen binding studies
Androgen binding activity was measured using a whole cell
binding assay, which provides both a quantitative measure
(Bmax) ar| d qualitative measures (Kj and thermolability) of
androgen binding (22). The majority (n=9) of the CAIS subjects
had no detectable binding, one had a qualitative binding
abnormality (high K<j and thermolability) and one had a
quantitative reduction (i.e. low Bm^). Two further CAIS
subjects were not assayed since only blood samples were available
from these cases. The PAIS group showed both qualitative (n=6)
and quantitative (n=2) abnormalities with a significant number
(n=6) showing no binding defect. The observation that apparently
normal androgen binding is associated with larger numbers of
PAIS compared to CAIS subjects is consistent with previous
studies (16, 19).
PCR-SSCP analysis of the androgen receptor gene
Oligonucleotides were designed as primers for the PCR
amplification of the coding regions of the androgen receptor gene.
The locations of the primers are shown schematically in Figure 1,

DNA sequencing of androgen receptor gene mutations
Having identified band-shifts in SSCP gels, putative mutant
segments of the androgen receptor gene were sequenced. PCR
fragments were gel-purified and sequenced directly, either after
an asymmetric PCR reaction to generate a single stranded
template or by double stranded sequencing. Figure 3 shows two
deletions and one insertion that were detected in CAIS subjects.
Two of the mutations occurred in exon A and caused frameshifts,
which would be expected to lead to highly truncated versions

and are listed in Table 1, with PCR fragment sizes. In general,
primers were designed to produce PCR fragments less than
350bp, since SSCP is more sensitive for smaller fragments (21,
23). The only exception is the exon D fragment at 385bp. This
fragment was cleaved with Tthl111 prior to electrophoresis which
generated fragments of 155 and 230bp.
The exon A coding sequence was subdivided into seven
overlapping fragments because of its large size (1613bp). The
A1/A2 segment contains the highly polymorphic polyglutamine
region of the androgen receptor (Figure 1) (25—27). Since the
repeat polymorphism would mask the effect of other mutations
within the A1/A2 segment on SSCP gels, we directly sequenced
this interval in the 27 AIS subjects. No point mutations were
found in this survey, and the length of the polyglutamine repeat
varied between 16-29 residues with a mean of 23. These results
are within the range found in the normal population (26). The
A13/A14 segment in exon A encodes the polyglycine stretch of
the androgen receptor. Accurate PCR amplification of this highly
GC-rich segment has not been reported, but has been shown to
lead to artificial shortening of the repeat (28). We have
encountered similar difficulties, and this region has therefore not
been analysed in our study so far.
For SSCP, denatured PCR fragments were run on
nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels either at room temperature
in the presence of 10% glycerol, or at 4°C in the absence of
glycerol (21). Some examples of the band-shifts detected by SSCP
are shown in Figure 2. In general, 4°C gels were most sensitive
(Figure 2a) although a few mutations were visualised more clearly
on the room temperature gels (Figure 2b). In other cases
mutations were detected easily using both sets of conditions
(Figure 2c). Overall, we detected changes in ten of thirteen CAIS
and six of fourteen PAIS subjects. In one CAIS and one PAIS
case these changes corresponded to silent mutations (see below).

of the androgen receptor in these subjects. In particular, the single
nucleotide deletion (Figure 3 a) would lead to termination of
translation due to the stop codon at nucleotide position 877 - 879
(29). Similarly, there is a stop codon at position 1055-1057
downstream of the four nucleotide insertion (Figure 3b). The
third mutation (Figure 3c) was a three nucleotide deletion leading
to the deletion of a single asparagine residue at position 692 in
the ligand binding domain of the receptor. The subject had a
profound qualitative abnormality in androgen binding (Table 2).
The other mutations detected were all point mutations. Two
of these were silent mutations. A guanine to adenine mutation
at position 995 was found in two cases. In one of these cases,
an additional silent mutation from cytosine to thymine at position
2762 was found. The position 995 mutation abolishes a StuI site,
and was detected in the normal population with a frequency of
8% (4 of 52 X chromosomes screened, results not shown). This
mutation is therefore likely to represent a neutral polymorphism,
having no effect on androgen receptor gene expression. The
significance of the position 2762 mutation is currently not known.
The remainder of the point mutations were predicted to cause
amino acid substitutions in the androgen receptor ligand binding
domain. Three examples are shown in Figure 4. These were
identified in a CAIS subject with negative binding (Figure 4a),

DISCUSSION
In this survey of 27 AIS subjects SSCP analysis led to the
identification of androgen receptor gene mutations resulting in
protein coding changes in fourteen cases. Mutations were found
in nine of thirteen CAIS and five of fourteen PAIS cases. The
four CAIS cases in which mutations were not identified included
three with negative androgen binding and one for whom binding
data were not available. It is therefore likely that androgen
receptor defects account for most, if not all cases of CAIS in
our study, although four androgen receptor gene mutations have
not been detected by SSCP. From this study we would therefore
estimate the detection rate for SSCP to be approximately 70%.
However, this may be an underestimate if the undetected
mutations exist within androgen receptor gene regions not yet
studied, such as the exon A polyglycine region or the androgen
receptor gene promoter. Nevertheless, 70% is comparable with
other estimates of SSCP sensitivity in analysing fragments of
approximately 35Obp (23, 30).
In contrast to the CAIS group, androgen receptor gene
mutations were only identified in 37% of the PAIS cases. Four
of the five mutations were in cases with a clear qualitative
abnormality of androgen binding, consistent with the position of
the mutation within the androgen binding domain of the receptor.
However, only one of the six PAIS cases with normal androgen
binding was shown to possess a mutation. From these results we
conclude that a qualitative abnormality in androgen binding is
a good indication that the androgen receptor is defective. When
no such binding abnormality is observed, it is possible that the
androgen receptor may not be defective. Strong candidate genes
in these cases of unexplained PAIS would be those genes whose
expression is controlled by the androgen receptor during genital
development. These target genes remain to be identified.
The identification of exon A frameshift mutations in CAIS is
a novel finding, and predicts the synthesis of a truncated Nterminal fragment of the androgen receptor. The testicular
feminized (tfiri) mouse, a model for CAIS, also carries an exon
A frameshift mutation in the androgen receptor gene (31 -33).
It has been shown that reinitiation of translation occurs at
methionine residues, downstream of the frameshift mutation (32).
Reinitiation is inefficient, but leads to the synthesis of low levels
of a receptor comprising the DNA and androgen binding
domains. This explains why a small amount of DNA and

a PAIS subject with a qualitative binding abnormality (Figure 4b)
and a PAIS subject with normal binding (Figure 4c). The normal
androgen binding in the latter subject is surprising in view of
the location of the mutation in the ligand binding domain. This
may be explained if the mutation leads to a defect in binding
which affects binding parameters not measured in our standard
assay.
The locations of all the mutations identified in this survey are
shown in Figure 5. Table 2 includes brief descriptions of the
patient phenotypes and their androgen binding data. Two CAIS
subjects were found to carry the same mutation affecting amino
acid position 750. However, the polyglutamine repeats were of
different lengths (23 and 25 residues) in the two subjects. This
indicates that the same mutation was not identified as the result
of a sample mix-up, or an unexpected familial relationship
between these subjects. In all other cases the mutations were
unique to each subject.

androgen binding activity is detected in tfin mice (34). A similar
observation has been made in a CAIS subject, carrying a nonsense
mutation in exon A (35). Reinitiation of translation downstream
of the stop codon leads to the production of low levels of Nterminally truncated androgen receptor with androgen binding
activity. It is possible that reinitiation of translation also occurs
in the frameshift mutants we have identified. In the single
nucleotide deletion mutant this could occur at methionine 229,
and in the four nucleotide insertion, at methionine 285 . However,

since even low levels of androgen binding were not detected in
these cases, reinitiation, if present, is likely to be very inefficient.
All other mutations identified in this study affect the ligand
binding domain of the androgen receptor, and provide valuable
information for the further characterisation of structural and
functional relationships in that domain. One mutation has been
reported previously in a PAIS subject in an independent study
(20). This is the mutation which changes arginine 855 to hisu'dine.

We have identified androgen receptor gene mutations in AIS
subjects with phenotypes ranging from complete to minimal
androgen insensitivity. The exon A frameshift mutations would
be predicted to have a dramatic effect on receptor expression,
and are therefore associated with severe clinical androgen
resistance. Apart from these, there is no clear correlation between
the position or nature of the androgen receptor gene mutation
and the severity of the clinical phenotype. However, it will now
be possible to express the mutant receptors and test whether the
phenotypic diversity in AIS is explained by the degree of receptor
dysfunction caused by the mutation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical subjects
All subjects studied had a normal 46XY karyotype and the gonads were testes.
The thirteen CAIS subjects had completely normal external female genitalia. The
fourteen PAIS subjects had a variety of genital phenotypes ranging from
undervirilised male with hypospadias, cryptorchidism and micropenis to virilised
female with clitoromegaly and labial fusion. Nine of the PAIS subjects had no
evidence of an androgen biosynthetic defect. This was demonstrated by normal
or high levels of circulating testosterone (n=2) or a normal testosterone response
to a human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) stimulation test (n=7) (42). Similar
biochemical data were not available for the remaining five PAIS subjects, but
they all had a clear qualitative or quantitative defect in androgen binding, and
were therefore included in the study.
Tissue culture
Fibroblast cell lines were established from genital skin biopsies obtained at surgery,
by primary explanation in E199 medium containing 20% foetal calf serum and
supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin and glutamine . The seium was reduced
to 10% after the second passage and maintained at that level thereafter. Cells
were grown at 37°C in 5% COj.

Androgen binding assay
Androgen binding was measured in genital skin fibroblasts using a whole cell
binding assay (22). Briefly, between 5 x 10s and 1 x 106 cells were incubated at
37 °C with pH]-DHT at concentrations ranging from 0.06nM to lnM.
Incubations were carried out in the absence or presence of a 200-fold excess of
unlabeUed DHT, to measure nonspecific binding. Parallel incubations were also
carried out at 40°C with lnM pH]-DHT in the absence or presence of unlabeUed
DHT to measure the thermolability of binding. All assay points were performed
in duplicate, except the 40°C points which were done in triplicate. Scatchard
analysis was carried out using the Combicept 2000 Steroid Receptor Assay software
and a 2500 TR Packard liquid scintillation counter. This provided measures of
both receptor amounts (B,^) expressed as moles per n% DNA, and dissociation
constant (Kj). DNA concentration was estimated using the Burton assay (43).
A normal range was calculated for the binding parameters from nine genital
skin fibroblast cell lines from normal individuals. The values are given in the
legend to TaWe 2. Binding parameters were classified as abnormal when the values
fell greater than two standard deviations away from the mean.
PCR-SSCP analysis of the androgen receptor gene
Genomk DNA was prepared from genital skin fibroblasts or from whole blood
by standard methods. Fourteen pairs of oligonucleotide primers were used to
amplify the coding regions of the androgen receptor gene. The positions of the
primers and amplified segments are given in Table 1. Primers were synrhesised
using a Pharmacia LKB Gene Assembler Plus. A 10/d PCR reaction was used
for SSCP and contained the following components: lOOng genomic DNA, 50/tM
dNTPs, 2.5^Ci [a-32P]-dATP, 0.2units Taq polymerase (Cambio Ltd), 1/J Panbuffer (Cambio Ltd), 2pmol each primer. PCR using primers All and A12 was
inefficient at these conditions and the Parr buffer was replaced with lOmM Tris
(pH8.8), 50mM KC1, lmM MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.1%
Triton X-100. Reactions were denatured at 95°C for 2 minutes and subjected
to 30 cycles of amplification at 95°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 55-62°C (see
Table) for 1 minute, and extension at 72°C for 1 minute. This was followed by
a final 5 minute extension at 72°C. Stop buffer (10/J) containing 95% formamide,
20mM EDTA, 0.05% bromophenol blue and 0.05% xylene cyanol FF was added
to the reactions. They were then denatured at 95°C for 5 minutes and stored
on ice before loading. The interval Al - A 2 was not analysed by SSCP since
this region is highly polymorphic. This region was analysed only by direct
sequencing of PCR products. The interval A13-A14 contains a highly GC-rich
sequence which we were not able to amplify successfully. This region has therefore
not been analysed.
Analysis of exon D incorporated an additional digestion step prior to the
denaturation. This was done because the fragment size wasrelativelylarge (385bp),
and would have reduced the sensitivity of the SSCP screening. After the PCR,
2pX of the exon D reactions were digested with Tthl 111, in a volume of 10/d.
This produced two fragments of sizes 155 bp and 230bp. These products were
mixed with stop buffer and denatured before loading as above.
A 40cmx20cm vertical gel apparatus incorporating fan cooling was used for
SSCP gels (Cambridge Hectrophoresis Ltd). Analysis was carried out using two
sets of conditions for every PCR fragment. Gels containing 6% acrylamide,
1 xTBE (90mM Tris-borate pH8.2, 2.5mM EDTA) were run at 4°C in the cold
room. Gels containing 10% glycerol, 6% acrylamide, 1 XTBE were run at room
temperature. All gels were run at 12-25Watts in 1 xTBE buffer. The bromophenol
blue dye was run to the end of the gel and the gel was then dried prior to
autoradiography.
DNA sequencing of PCR products
Preparative PCR reactions were carried out in a total volume of 100/tl. These
were scaled up versions of the reactions described. After PCR, mineral oil was
removed and the reactions were extracted once with 200jd chloroform. The
volumes were then reduced to approximately 20/J under vacuum prior to loading
on a 1% low melting point agarose gel. The excised gel bands were purified
using a Magic PCR Preps™ DNA purification lot (Promega). Subsequently, the
sequencing reactions were carried out with the ./mo/™ DNA sequencing system
(Promega), using the same primers as for PCR. The primers were labelled with
[-yJ2P]-ATP. Standard conditions were used for sequencing gel electrophoresis.
In all cases mutations were sequenced on both DNA strands.
Although most of the mutations were sequenced as described the mutations
in the CAIS subject at position 864 and those in PAIS subjects at positions 855
and 869 were sequenced after an asymmetric PCR (44). A 20:1 ratio of primers
was used, and the single stranded products were purified by phenol and chloroform
extractions, and isopropanol precipitation. Subsequently, the products were
sequenced using the sequenase® sequencing kit.

been reported in CAIS subjects (36, 37). The less conservative
amino acid change in the latter subjects presumably accounts for
their lack of androgen binding, and complete phenotype. Two
of the other point mutations we have identified are particularly
interesting. The mutation which alters arginine 774 to histidine
was found in a CAIS patient with reduced levels but qualitatively
normal androgen binding. There are three independent reports
of a mutation altering arginine 774 to cysteine also in CAIS
subjects, but androgen binding in these cases was reported as
negative (38-40). The mutation that we identified is more
conservative, which could explain the less profound androgen
binding abnormality. This abnormality is sufficient however to
lead to complete androgen insensitivity. Comparative functional
studies of these receptor mutants will allow investigation of their
abilities to activate transcription, and may explain why the
mutations at arginine 774 produce different defects in androgen
binding, but a CAIS phenotype. The mutation affecting glutamine
798 is also noteworthy, since no androgen binding defect was
found in this patient, although clinically the androgen insensitivity
is severe (Table 2). If the mutation is responsible for the clinical
phenotype, it is possible that there is a defect in androgen binding,
which was not detected in our binding assay. This could be
revealed by the measurement of other binding parameters such
as dissociation rate constant. Alternatively, the mutation may
point to a role for this region of the androgen binding domain
in transcriptional regulation. Such subdomains are proposed to
exist within the ligand binding domains of members of the steroid
receptor superfamily (2, 41). Functional studies of these types
of mutant receptors will help to define the extent and the
physiological significance of these domains.
