Summary
Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is a human autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency of
aldolase B that results in an inability to metabolize
fructose and related sugars. We report here the first
identification of a molecular lesion in the aldolase B
gene of an affected individual whose defective protein
has previously been characterized. The mutation is a
G--*C transversion in exon 5 that creates a new recognition site for the restriction enzyme Ahall and results
in an amino acid substitution (Ala~Pro) at position
149 of the protein within a region critical for substrate
binding. Utilizing this novel restriction site and the
polymerase chain reaction, the patient was shown to
be homozygous for the mutation. Three other HFI patients from pedigrees unrelated to this individual were
found to have the same mutation: two were homozygous and one was heterozygous. We suggest that this
genetic lesion is a prevailing cause of hereditary fructose intolerance.
Introduction

Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is an autosomal
recessive disease that is characterized by abdominal
pare, vomtting, and hypoglycaemia following the ingestion
of fructose or related sugars (Chambers and Pratt, 1956;
Gttzelmann et al., 1983). In infants at weaning, the condition may be severe and cause fatal liver dysfunction
(Odtevre et al., 1978), but it responds dramattcally to dietary exclusion. Although the inctdence of the dtsease in
different populations is unknown, a survey in Switzerland
esttmated a frequency of 1 in 20,000, and therefore a carher frequency of 1% (Gttzelmann and Baerlocher, 1973).
The association of a catalytic defect in aldolase B with HFI
has been well documented (Hers and Joassm, 1961).
Aldolase B (EC.4.1.2.13) catalyzes the cleavage of
fructose-l-phosphate to form dlhydroxyacetone phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde (Hers and Kusaka, 1953)
The enzyme is expressed exclustvely tn the liver, kidney,
and intestine--tissues that actively assimdate fructose. AIdolase B ts thus functionally distinct from the homologous
isozymes, aldolases A and C, which are abundant in muscle and nervous tissue, respectively, and which have a
greater activity wtth respect to fructose 1,6-diphosphate
(Penhoet and Rutter, 1971).

Hereditary fructose intolerance is genettcally heterogeneous (Gitzelmann et al., 1974; Gregori et al., 1982; Cox
et al., 1983a), but immunologically detectable ~ldolase B
has been found in biopsy samples of all affected tissues
examined thus far (Nordmann et al., 1968; Gregori et al.,
1982). In several studies, the apparent concentratton of
cross-reacting material (crm +) was markedly reduced,
and a regulatory defect of tissue-specific expression has
been proposed (Gregon et al., 1982). However, immunotitration studies in patients with diminished apparent crm +
tn liver and intestine demonstrated the presence of abundant bssue aldolase B with reduced specific activity and
impatred recognition by polyclonal anttbodies (Cox et al.,
1983b). Thus naturally occurring mutations in crm ÷ patients alter regtons of the aldolase B protein that are critical for functional actiwty, but they may also induce major
structural changes that lead to impaired antibody recognitton. Precise characterization of such genetic defects
should help to define crttical regions of the enzyme and
clarify the relattonship between aldolase structure and its
function.
The aldolase B gene has been mapped to human chromosome 9 and sequenced (Tolan and Penhoet, 1986). It
consists of nine exons, the first of which is untranslated.
The cognate mRNA encodes 364 amino acids and there
are three independent reports of its sequence (Rottman
et al., 1984; Sakakibara et al., 1985; Paolella et al., 1984).
Previously, molecular defects of aldolase B in hereditary
fructose intolerance have not been identified. Here, we report the sequence analysis of the aldolase B genes of a
patient tn whom the mutant protein has been characterized wtth respect to enzymattc activity, immunological reactwity, and subunit structure (Cox et al., 1982; Cox et al.,
1983b).
Results and Discussion
Cloning and Sequencing of a Mutant Aldolase B Gene
A genomlc library was constructed from leucocyte DNA
prepared from an HFI patient who has been described
previously and studied (Cox et al., 1982, Cox et al., 1983b).
Six clones, containing exons 3-9 on a 9 kb BamHI fragment, were recovered. The complete sequence of the coding regtons from one of these clones was determined and
a single base pair change was f o u n d - a G-->C transversion at codon 149 (Figure 1). The mutatton causes a proline residue to be substituted for an alanine at this position and hence is designated A149R Exon 2 from the same
patient was cloned directly into a plasmid after specific
amplification of that exon by the polymerase chain reactton
(PCR) (Satki et al., 1985). Five independent clones were
sequenced and found to be normal.
The splicing signals for all the introns, comprising the
5'GT/3'AG splice sttes and the intron sequences containing the lariat branch point signal within 50 bp of the 3'
sphce stte, were determined. These sequences were iden*
tical to the w~ld type with the exception of a deleted C resi-

due 16 bp upstream of the start of exon 8. This is the first
base of the polypyrimidine tract that precedes the 3' splice
site and is too far downstream to disrupt the lariat branch
point signal found between - 3 7 and -18 (Reed and Mamatis, 1985). Indeed, the only candtdate sequence (GACTAAT, see consensus PyXPyTPuAPy) lies between positions - 3 5 and - 2 9 in this intron. The deleted C cannot
cause activation Of a cryptic 3' splice site since the use of
alternative AG sttes within the intron would generate a
truncated product due to stop codons in the retained intron sequence. Activation of the first in frame AG within
exon 8 would produce a protein 11 amino acids shorter,
with altered charge and incompatible with the mutant aldolase B in this patient, which has a slightly increased apparent subunit size without a change in charge (Cox et al.,
1983b).

Detection of the A149P Mutation by Direct Analysis
of Amplified Genomic DNA
The A149P mutation creates a new recognition site for the
restriction enzyme Ahall (GPuCGPyC). However, this enzyme and its isoschizomers were found to cut leucocyte
DNA very poorly even when used in large excess, and detection of the mutation by Southern blotting of genomic
DNA was not undertaken. Thts may be due to methylatlon
of genes not actively expressed m white cells. Cloned
DNA was efficiently cleaved by Ahall, and all six HFI
clones were found to contain the A149P mutation (data not
shown), suggestmg that the mdividual was homozygous.
To confirm this, exon 5 sequences were specifically amplified from genomic DNA of this patient by the PCR and

digested with Ahall. The amplified 306 bp fragment was
cleaved completely by the restriction enzyme to give products of 183 bp and 123 bp, thus demonstrating the presence of the mutation in both alleles of the gene (Figure 2,
lane 5). As expected, exons 5 from normal individuals
were not digested by Ahall (Figure 2, lane 1). An identical
analysis was carried out on three HFI individuals unrelated to the patient above. Two of them, a brother and
sister, were also found to be homozygous for the A149P
mutation (Figure 2, lanes 2 and 3). The third patient was
heterozygous (Figure 2, lane 4). Thts latter patient is therefore a compound heterozygote, and the amphfied exon 5
fragment that was not cut by Ahall represents and originated from a different mutant allele. This corroborates the
prevtous study of the mutant enzyme in this patient in
which the aldolase differed structurally from that of the
HFI individual first shown to be homozygous for the A149P
mutation. Nonetheless, the phenotypic manifestations of
disease in these two patients are clinically indistinguishable (Cox et al., 1982; Cox et al., 1983a).

Segregation of the A149 Allele in an Affected Pedigree
To demonstrate segregation of the A149P alleles, genomic
DNA was isolated from five members of a pedigree affected by HFI and was analyzed by digestion with Ahall
after PCR amplification. The family includes the two affected individuals shown to be homozygous for the A149P
allele (Figure 2, lanes 2 and 3; Figure 3, lanes 3 and 4).
As predicted by the autosomal recessive transmission of
the disorder, both unaffected parents carry one wild-type
and one mutant allele (Figure 3, lanes 1 and 2). Their
asymptomatic daughter was found to be a heterozygous
carrier of the disease (Figure 3, lane 5). These data show
that inheritance of two alleles bearing this mutation is associated with expression of the disease in this kindred.
Our findings indicate that homozygosity for the A149P
allele is directly responsible for the HFI phenotype in several apparently unrelated patients. Aldolase B was cloned

the enzyme, =.e, catalytic rather than regulatory (Cox et
al., 1983b) The mutant gene was s e q u e n c e d and found
to contain a single base pair c h a n g e with respect to the
wild type, resulting in a missense mutation in the protein.
In addition, this lesion was found in other unrelated individuals with HFI and segregated with the disease m an affected pedigree as a recessive Mendelian character.

Implications of the A149P Mutation for
Catalytic Function
Aldolase isozyme cDNA clones have been sequenced
from diverse species and show considerable homology. It
is notable that the a m i n o acid residue at position 149 (the
site of the mutation shown here) is specific for aldolase B
(Figure 4). In the human, rat, and chicken e n z y m e this is

the Site of the Mutation Described Here (posrtton 149 marked by an
arrow)
This residue ts an alamne ~naldolase B but cysteme tn aldolases A and
C and thus may be involved in aldolase B-specific catalysts. The sequences were obtained from the following publications human B (Rottmann et al., 1984); rat B (Tsutsumt et al, 1985), chcken B (Burgess
and Penhoet, 1985), human A (Izzo et al., 1987), rabbit A (Tolan et al,
1984); human C (Rottmann et al, 1987), mouse C (Paolella et al,
1986).

an alanine, but aldolases A and C possess a cysteine at
this position. The residue may therefore be involved in aldolase B-specific catalysis. The insertion of a prohne residue, an imino acid in which peptide bond formation involves the rigid pyrollidone ring, is known to alter protein
s e c o n d a r y structure. Moreover, vicinal residues (Lys 146
and Arg 148) are implicated in the binding of substrate
(Hartman and Brown, 1976; Patthy et al., 1979) and have
been shown by X-ray crystallography of muscle aldolase
to be located on the ~ strand of a binding pocket (Sygusch
et al., 1987). Thus mutation resulting in the c h a n g e of Ala
149 to proline is likely to disrupt the spatial configuration
of juxtaposed restdues in aldolase B and adversely affect
its catalytic properties. That this mutation drastically modifies e n z y m e structure is shown by the markedly reduced
i m m u n o r e a c t w i t y of the protein and by tts altered electrophoretic mobility wtthout c h a n g e in charge (Cox et al.,
1983b).
Carrier Detection and Diagnosis of
Fructose Intolerance
The A149P mutation has been found in five out of the six
HFI alleles studied. This implies that the methods employed here may facilitate carrier detection and diagnosis
=n families affected by the disease. Further work is needed
to ascertain the true prevalence of th~s mutation. We suggest that the selection pressure against HFI was probably
minimal before sugars b e c a m e widely available wtth the
advent of the industrial revolution. Mutations in aldolase
B may have been able to accumulate by genetic drift and
it =s therefore possible that a limited n u m b e r of mutant alleles may account for the great majority of individuals affected by fructose intolerance.
Experimental Procedures
Cloning of a Mutant Aldolase B Gene
Genomtc DNA obtained from peripheral leucocytes of an HFI patient
was dtgested to complehon wtth BamHI and slze-fractionated on an
agarose gel. An aldolase B-enriched fraction of approximately 9 kb
(Tolan and Penhoet, 1986) was recovered by the freeze-squeezetechnlque (Tautz and Renz, 1983) and hgated to XL47 arms (Loenen and
Brammar, 1980). Packaging extracts were prepared and the reactions
performed as described (Scherer et al, 1981). A sequence in intron 6
of aldolase B has previously been found to be unclonable rn rec A
stratus of E coh (Tolan and Penhoet, 1986), presumably because =t
contains a long palindrome or homopolymer tract (Leach and Stahl,
1983, Nader et al, 1986) This problem was obviated by plating the library on a rec BC sbcB host (Leach and Stahl, 1983). Six aldolase B
clones, containing exens 3-9 on a 9 kb BamHI fragment, were retrieved by probing w~th the cDNA clone pilL413 (Rottmann et aL,
1984) Exon 2 was cloned directly from genom=cDNA after spectfic amplification of that exon by the polymerase chain reachon (PCR, see
below)
DNA Sequence Analysis
Fragments of one phage clone, designated XEE13, were subcloned
into pEMBL 18 or 19 (Dente et al., 1983) and sequenced by the chain
terminator method (Sanger et al., 1977) using either the M13 universal
primer (New England Btolabs) or specific ohgonucleottde primers derived from the genomtc sequence (Tolan and Penhoet, 1986) and synthesized on a Cyclone DNA synthesizer (Btosearch, Inc.).
DNA Amplification
The polymerase chain reaction was performed as follows: 1 p.g
genomtc DNA was dispersed in 100 #1 PCR reaction buffer (50 mM

KCI, 2 mM MgCI2, 10 mM Iris (pH 8.3), 0.1% gelatin, 0.2 mM each
PCR primers, 0.2 mM dATE 0 2 rnM dTTP, 0.2 mM dCTP, 0.2 mM dGTP)
in 0.5 ml mtcrofuge tubes. The DNA was denatured by heating to 95°C
for 7 min. The samples were transferred to a water bath (45°C) for 5
min to allow annealing of the pnmers. One unit of Taq polymerase (Anghan Biotechnology Ltd ) was added, and the reaction mixes were
overlaid with 50 p.I mineral oil (Sigma). The tubes were transferred to
a 70°C water bath for 3 rain to allow primer extension, denatured to
91°C for 2 rain, and reannealed at 45°C for 2 rain This cycle was
repeated 30 times with the addition of a further unit of Taq polymerase
after every 10 cycles. Aliquots of the reactions were analyzed on 2%
mm~gels: usually 200 ng-1 p.g of the desired fragment was produced
Occasionally, however, add,tlonal spurious bands were also found,
usually of very small size. In these cases the correct fragment was excised from the gel and recovered The primers used for amplification
were" 5'GTTGTTATATGATGAGACTG3' and 5'GAGCCACCCATGGTTCTGTG3' for exon 2, which produced a 201 bp fragment, and 5'CCATGGATCAGGTACAAAGG3' and 5'GGTCCATTTGTAGTTATAGT3' for
exon 5, which produced a 306 bp fragment.
Detection of A149P Allele
AldoSase B exon 5 was specifically amplified by the PCR from genomlc
DNA obtained from HFI patients and normal controls The 306 bp fragment was digested with Ahall (New England Biolabs) according to the
manufacturer's recommendat=ons The mutant A149P allele =scleaved
to produce bands of 183 bp and 123 bp.
