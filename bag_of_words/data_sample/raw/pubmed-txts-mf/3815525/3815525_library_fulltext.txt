Summary
A defective LDL receptor gene in a child with familial
hypercholesterolemia
produces a receptor precursor
that is 50,000 daltons larger than normal (apparent M,
170,000 vs. 120,000). The elongated
protein resulted
from a 14 kilobase
duplication
that encompasses
exons 2 through 8. The duplication
arose from an unequal crossing-over
between homologous
repetitive
elements (Alu sequences)
in intron 1 and intron 8. The
mutant receptor has 18 contiguous
cysteine-rich
repeat sequences instead of the normal nine. Seven of
these duplicated
repeats are derived from the lfgandbinding domain,
and two repeats are part of the
epidermal growth factor precursor homology
region.
The elongated
receptor undergoes
normal carbohydrate processing,
its apparent molecular
weight increases to 210,000, and the receptor reaches the cell
surface where it binds reduced amounts of LDL but
undergoes efficient internalization
and recycling. The
current findings
support
an evolutionary
model in
which homologous
recombination
between repetitive
elements in introns leads to exon duplication
during
evolution of proteins.
Introduction
Proteins that function in the extracellular environment are
often built up of repeating amino acid sequences that are
suspected to have arisen through exon duplication (Gilbert, 1978, 1985; Doolittle, 1985). A potential mechanism
for such duplication emerged from the discovery of repetitive DNA sequences that occur several hundred thousand
times within the genome. Unequal crossing-over caused
by homologous
recombination
between repetitive elements within different introns could lead to deletion or
duplication of exons (Alberts et al., 1983). Several examples of exon deletion based on this mechanism have recently been described (for review, see Lehrman et al.,
1987a). To date, however, there is no specific example of
exon duplication resulting from recombination
between
repetitive elements.
One gene that is likely to have evolved through exon
duplication
is the gene for the low density lipoprotein
(LDL) receptor, a protein that contains many cysteine-rich
repeats (Stidhof et al., 1985a, 1985b). Located on the surface of body cells, this 839 amino acid glycoprotein binds
cholesterol-carrying
lipoproteins,
LDL and P-migrating

very low density lipoproteins (6-VLDL), and carries them
into cells in coated pits. The ligand-binding
domain of the
LDL receptor consists of seven cysteine-rich repeats of 40
amino acids each that are encoded by five exons (exons
2-6 of the LDL receptor gene). The first two repeats and
the last two repeats are each encoded in single exons. The
middle three repeats are encoded in one exon. All of the
introns in this region interrupt the sequence between the
first and second nucleotide of a codon, and all of them occur precisely at the borders of repeats. Exons 7 and 8 encode two additional 40 amino acid cysteine-rich repeats
that are not homologous
to the repeats in the ligandbinding domain. Rather, the latter two repeats are derived
from an ancestral gene that also donated exons to the
gene for the precursor to epidermal growth factor (Siidhof
et al., 1985b). These so-called “‘growth factor” repeats
have been found in a wide variety of other genes (Doolittle,
1985).
The LDL receptor is synthesized in the endoplasmic
reticulum as a precursor with an apparent molecular
weight of 120,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels (Tolleshaug et al., 1982). The precursor
contains a cluster of O-linked N-acetylgalactosamine
residues attached to a region near the plasma membrane
as well as several isolated O-linked residues and several
N-linked carbohydrate chains in the immature high-mannose form (Cummings et al., 1983; Davis et al., 1986a).
When the receptor moves to the Golgi complex, the
O-linked chains are elongated and sialylated, and the
N-linked sugars are converted to mature sialic acidcontaining carbohydrate chains. This processing causes
the apparent molecular weight of the receptor on SDS
polyacrylamide
gels to increase from 120,000 to 160,000
(Tolleshaug et al., 1982; Cummings et al., 1983). Most of
this apparent 40,000 dalton increase is attributable to
anomalous migration on SDS gels, owing to the elongation of the clustered O-linked sugar chains (Davis et al.,
1986a).
Mutations in the gene for the LDL receptor occur in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia
(FH), a common
autosomal
dominant disease (Goldstein and Brown,
1983). FH heterozygotes have one mutant LDL receptor
gene and produce half the normal number of functional
LDL receptors. FH homozygotes have two abnormal LDL
receptor genes. Because of the high frequency of these
mutations, FH homozygotes frequently inherit different
mutant genes from both parents and are thus in fact compound heterozygotes. The term FH homozygote is retained, however, to refer to individuals who have two mutant genes at the LDL receptor locus, whether they are
identical or not.
The molecular basis of several mutant LDL receptor
genes has been defined through studies of altered receptor structure in cultured cells and through cloning and sequencing of the mutant genes. Mutations that have been
analyzed in this fashion include deletions, nonsense mutations, missense mutations, and one small duplication of

contains a 14 kilobase duplication
that encompasses
seven exons (exons 2 through 8); it arose through homologous recombination between repetitive Alu sequences in
intron 1 and intron 8. This duplication may be a pathologic
extension of the ancestral duplication events that led to
the evolution of the multiple repeats in the normal LDL
receptor gene.

Cells from the indicated subject were cultured as described
in Experimental Procedures.
On day 6 of cell growth after incubation for 16
hr in 10% lipoprotein-deficient
serum, three dishes were pulse-labeled
for 1 hr with [%]methionine
(160 ~Cilml) in methionine-free
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, followed by a chase for the indicated
time in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 200 PM unlabeled methionine.
Detergent extracts of the cells were prepared and
subjected to immunoprecipitation
with the monoclonal
anti-LDL receptor antibody IgG-C7 (immune) or the control nonimmune
monoclonal
antibody IgG-2001 (N), as indicated. Electrophoresis
of the precipitates
on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide
gels and fluorography
were performed as
described
in Experimental
Procedures.
The gel was exposed to preflashed x-ray film at -70%
for 2 days. The gel was calibrated
with
molecular weight standards
ranging from 200,000 to 43,000 daltons
(Tolleshaug
et al., 1963).

four nucleotides (Lehrman et al., 1985a, 1985b, 1986,
1987a, 1987b; Hobbs et al., 1986; Yamamoto et al., 1986;
Davis et al., 1986b). These mutations disrupt the biosynthesis of the receptor, its transport from the endoplasmic
reticulum to the Golgi complex, the binding of LDL, or the
internalization of the receptor in coated pits.
One puzzling mutation in an FH homozygote has not yet
been examined at the molecular level. The gene in question, present in a subject designated FH 295, produces an
LDL receptor precursor that is 50,000 daltons larger than
the normal precursor as determined on SDS polyacrylamide gels (Tolleshaug et al., 1982). This 170,000 dalton
precursor undergoes the normal 40,000 dalton increase in
molecular weight and appears on the cell surface as a
210,000 dalton protein. FH 295 inherited the allele producing the elongated LDL receptor from his father. From his
mother,
FH 295 inherited
a mutant
gene that produces
a
precursor of normal size (120,000 daltons) that is not carried to the Golgi
complex
and does not undergo any increase in molecular weight (Tolleshaug et al., 1982). Treatment of intact FH 295 cells with pronase destroys the
210,000 dalton protein but does not affect the 120,000 dalton protein that remains within the cell (Tolleshaug et al.,
1983). Although the 210,000 dalton receptor that reaches
the cell surface has some ability to bind lz51-LDL, the total amount of binding in the FH 295 cells is only 15% of
normal (Tolleshaug et al., 1982).
Here we report the molecular basis for the elongated
receptor in the FH 295 cells. We have found that this gene

Figure 1 shows a pulse-chase experiment designed to follow the synthesis and processing of LDL receptors in normal and FH 295 cells. After a 1 hr labeling period with
[%]methionine,
the cells were solubilized and incubated
with an anti-LDL receptor monoclonal antibody. The normal cells showed two immunoprecipitable
bands: the receptor precursor with an apparent molecular weight of
120,000 and the mature receptor with an apparent molecular weight of 160,000 (lane B). After a subsequent incubation for 1 hr in the presence of unlabeled methionine, all
of the precursor was converted into the mature form (lane
C). In the FH 295 cells, the 1 hr labeling period produced
three specifically immunoprecipitable
bands: the 120,000
dalton precursor, a novel band at 170,000 daltons, and a
novel band at 210,000 daltons (lane E). After the 1 hr chase
with unlabeled methionine, the 120,000 dalton band did
not change (note the absence of any 160,000 dalton band),
but the 170,000 dalton band was converted to 210,000 daltons (lane F). Previous pedigree studies have shown that
FH 295 inherited the mutant allele producing the 120,000
dalton receptor from the mother and the 170,000 dalton
precursor from the father (Tolleshaug et al., 1982). The
170,000 dalton precursor matures to 210,000 daltons quite
efficiently, indicating that it is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi at a normal rate.
Figure 2A shows the exon structure of the normal LDL
receptor gene and its correlation with the domain structure of the receptor protein. Figure 2B shows the recombination model that we have invoked to explain the production of an elongated protein by the FH 295 gene. The
model envisions a meiotic unequal crossing-over between
intron 8 and intron 1 in two LDL receptor genes, giving rise
to two products. One product contains a duplication of
exons 2 through 8, which would correspond to the proposed FH 295 allele. In the other product, exons 2 through
8 are deleted. For convenience in describing the FH 295
gene, the 5’ copy of exons 2-8 is designated as Repeat
1 and the 3’ copy of exons 2-8 is designated Repeat 2.
Figure 3 shows a Southern blot of genomic DNA from
a normal subject and FH 295 probed with a 32P-labeled
restriction fragment taken from exon 7. The middle and
lower panels of the figure show the proposed derivation
of each of the visualized bands according to the known restriction map of the normal LDL receptor gene (Siidhof et
al., 1985a) and the recombination
model of Figure 2.
Digestion with Bglll gave a single band of 14 kb with normal and FH 295 DNA. The model predicts that FH 295
should have two 14 kb Bglll fragments that hybridize with
the probe. EcoRl produced a single 8 kb band in normal
DNA, but produced an additional 12 kb band in the FH 295

DNA. According to the model, the 8 kb band in FH 295
comes from Repeat 2. The 12 kb band extends from intron
6 in Repeat 1 to exon 5 in Repeat 2, bridging the recombination joint. Finally, digestion with Asp718 (which recognizes the same sequence as Kpnl) yields a 20 kb fragment
extending from intron 2 to intron 14 in the normal gene.
The FH 295 gene gives the normal 20 kb fragment as well
as a 14 kb fragment that extends from intron 2 in Repeat
1 to intron 2 in Repeat 2. Southern blotting of genomic
DNA from the mother of FH 295 gave a normal restriction
pattern with the exon 7 probe, indicating that her mutant
gene has no gross rearrangement,
while Southern blotting of the father’s DNA showed the same abnormal bands
that were present in FH 295 (data not shown).
Additional Southern blotting experiments showed that
the recombination joint in the FH 295 gene was contained
on an abnormal 13 kb BamHl restriction fragment (data
not shown). BamHl fragments of this size were obtained
from genomic DNA of FH 295 by sucrose density gradient
fractionation and cloned into bacteriophage
h. Recombinant phages harboring the abnormal fragment were isolated by plaque hybridization and their inserts subcloned
into a pBR322 vector. Figure 4 compares the restriction

map of the cloned hFH 295 fragment with the corresponding regions of the normal LDL receptor gene as determined by Siidhof et al. (1985a). The 5’ end of the FH 295
clone contains the cluster of BamHI, Stul, and Sphl sites
that are found in and around exon 8 of the normal gene.
On the 3’ side of these sites, the FH 295 clone contains
the Kpnl, Xhol, Stul, and EcoRl sites that are present in
the normal gene between exons 2 and 8. The cloned fragment from FH 295 did not contain the cluster of BamHl
sites that are present around exon 10 of the normal gene.
Thus the cloned portion of the FH 295 gene contained
exon 8 followed by exons 2-8, consistent with the recombination model of Figure 3. The presence and absence of
exons 2 and 9, respectively, in the FH 295 clone was confirmed by dot-blot analysis with specific hybridization
probes (data not shown).
To determine the nucleotide sequence at the recombination joint, we cloned relevant fragments from the normal
gene and the FH 295 gene into suitable vectors (Figure 5).
The sequence revealed that the recombination
had occurred between repetitive elements of the Alu family
(Figures 5 and 6). For convenience we numbered all three
sequences according to the standard nomenclature of Alu

942 to 1007) of the human LDL

element8 (Deininger
et al., 1981). The FH 295 gene
showed a perfect match with the sequence of an Alu element in intron 8 over a stretch of 68 nucleotides up to the
position labeled -148 in Figure 5. Thereafter, there was
clear dissimilarity between the FH 295 gene and the intron
8 sequence. Beginning at position -123 and continuing

through position -168, the sequence of FH 295 showed
a perfect match with an Alu element in intron 1. Between
positions -123 and -148 all three sequence8 were identical. Thus the cross-over could have occurred anywhere
between positions -123 and -148 (Figure 5).
Figure 6 shows the location of the recombination
joint
and the surrounding
Alu sequences in the two introns.
The recombination joined an isolated left arm of an Alu sequence in intron 1 to the left arm of a cluster of Alu sequences in intron 8.
Exons 2-8 of the LDL receptor gene encode nine
cysteine-rich repeat8 of approximately
40 amino acids
each (Figure 2A). The first seven repeats, which are homologous with one another, constitute the ligand-binding
domain. The last two repeat8 are derived from the gene
for the EGF precursor. All of the splice sites are in the
same reading frame. Thus duplication
of exons 2-8
should produce a messenger RNA that is translated into
an abnormally long receptor which contains 18 contiguous cysteine-rich repeats instead of the original 9. In RNA
blotting experiments, messenger RNAs of 6.5 kb (corresponding to the elongated 210,000 dalton receptor) and
5.3 kb (corresponding
to the nOnprOCe8Sed 120,000 dalton
receptor) were detected in the FH 295 cells (data not
shown).
We previously reported that the FH 295 cells bound
about 15% of the normal amount of lz51-LDL at 4%
(Tolleshaug et al., 1982). This binding activity must be attributable to the elongated receptor since the 120,000
dalton receptor produced by the maternal allele never
reaches the surface (Tolleshaug et al., 1983). To characterize more completely the receptor bearing a duplication
of the entire ligand-binding
domain, we performed additional ligand binding studies in the FH 295 cells. To measure the affinity of the receptor for 1251-LDL, we incubated
the cells at 4% with either lz51-LDL or 1251-lgG-C7, a
monoclonal antibody that binds stoichiometrically
to the
LDL receptor (Beisiegel et al., 1981). The maximum binding of 1*%lgG-C7 was approximately one-fourth of normal
(Figure 7A). The concentration
of 1251-lgG-C7 that gave
half-maximal binding (SO.s)was 0.06 uglml in the FH 295
cells as well as the normal cells, as calculated from
Lineweaver-Burke
plots. The binding of 1251-LDL in the
FH 295 cells was reduced in proportion to the reduction
in l*sl-lgGC7 binding (Figure 78). The apparent affinity
for 1251-LDL was similar in both the normal and FH 295
cells (Se.s, 0.75 to 0.83 uglml).
At 37% the receptor produced by the FH 295 gene also
showed a normal affinity for 1251-LDL (Figure 8). The So.5
values were indistinguishable
in the normal and FH 295
cells. The internalization
index for 1251-LDL, i.e., the sum
of internalized
and degraded 1251-LDL divided by the
amount of surface l*%LDL in the steady state (Goldstein
et al., 1977), was slightly reduced in the FH 295 cells as
compared with the normal (Figure 8). Under standard conditions (10 ug 1251-LDL for 5 hr at 37%), the internalization
index was 33 in normal cells and 24 in FH 295 cells (data
derived from Figure 8). The value of 24 is at the lower
range of values observed in normal cells in other experiments (Goldstein et al., 1977; Davis et al., 19866).

Discussion

Through cloning of the recombination
joint in the FH
295 gene, we had a unique opportunity to observe the
mechanism for such a duplication. It is not possible to
identify the mechanism for normal duplication events because the ancestral genes that gave rise to the duplication
are not available. In studying the FH 295 mutation, however, we were able to identify the sites in the normal gene
where the duplication had taken place. A recombination
event between two members of the middle repetitive Alu
family was found. The likely mechanism for such recombination is the unequal crossing-over shown in Figure 2.
This mechanism predicts the existence of the reciprocal
product, i.e., a gene in which exons 2 through 8 have been
deleted. To date, no evidence of such a reciprocal product
has been found in any of the FH genes analyzed.
Up until now, eight large deletions in the globin and LDL
receptor genes have been found to have an Alu repeat at
one or both ends (Figure 9). In the LDL receptor gene, the
deletions involve different Alu elements located in introns
4, 5, and 15 and in the 3’ untranslated region of exon 18.

The current data on the FH 295 mutation are of interest
from two points of view: first, because of the genetic mechanism for the duplication of seven exons, and second, because of the effect of such a large duplication on the cellular movement and binding activity of the LDL receptor.
With regard to duplication, it has frequently been postulated that recombination
between repetitive elements in
introns might be one mechanism by which eukaryotic
genes have acquired duplicated elements (Alberts et al.,
1983). Duplication must have occurred during the evolution of the LDL receptor gene in order to create the seven
copies of the cysteine-rich binding repeat and the two
copies of the cysteine-rich EGF precursor repeat. In the
case of FH 295, however, evolution seems to have gone
one step too far. Instead of improving the binding ability
of the LDL receptor, the duplication
of the first nine
cystene-rich repeats has reduced the functionality of the
receptor.

Each value represents
the average of duplicate incubations.
The concentration
of rz51-LDL giving half-maximal
binding (S& was calculated from Lineweaver-Burke
plots.

The deletions between these elements range from 0.8 to
7.8 kb (for review, see Lehrman et al., 1987a). Nine of the
11 Alu break points in the globin and LDL receptor genes
have occurred in the left arm, and eight of these are between the A and B sequences that are thought to function
as promoter elements for RNA polymerase Ill (Figure 9).
The recombination
event in the FH 295 gene follows the
same pattern. The frequent occurrence of breakpoints in
this region raises the possibility that it may adopt an unusual configuration
during transcription
that renders it
prone to recombination.
It should be pointed out that Alu
sequences are not absolutely required for the generation
of gross rearrangements.
Several known deletions at the
globin locus do not involve repetitive elements at either
end (Orkin and Kazazian, 1984). Thus several classes of
mutation mechanisms responsible for deletions in the human genome must exist.
At the protein level, a remarkable feature of the FH 295
receptor is that it seems to move at a relatively normal rate
from one organelle to another. Previous data indicate that
proteins that fold improperly cannot move efficiently from
the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex (Gething
et al., 1986; Yamamoto et al., 1986; Lehrman et al.,
1987b). The FH 295 receptor contains 373 extra amino
acids that are organized into nine additional cysteine-rich
repeats of approximately 40 amino acids each. These extra amino acids must apparently fold and form disulfide
bonds normally since the protein is readily transported to
the Golgi complex and the cell surface. This observation
supports our previous conclusion
that each of the
cysteine-rich repeats folds independently
(Yamamoto et
al., 1986; Lehrman et al., 1987b). In moving to the Golgi,

the FH 295 receptor increases in molecular weight by approximately 40,000 daltons, which is the same increase as
that exhibited by the normal receptor. The explanation for
this phenomenon
now seems clear: the FH 295 receptor
has only one copy of the serine- and threonine-rich region
(exon 15) that is the site for addition of clustered O-linked
sugars. These clustered O-linked sugars cause the
molecular weight to increase anomalously on SDS gels by
an apparent 40,000 daltons independently
of the number
of cysteine-rich repeats (Davis et al., 1986A).
In this and a previous study (Tolleshaug et al., 1982), we
found that the FH 295 receptor has a normal affinity, but
a reduced capacity, for binding LDL. Ostlund et al. (1982)
reported that the receptor in the FH 295 cells had a 5-fold
increased affinity for 1251-LDL (FH 295 is sibling 1 in their
paper). We have not been able to document such a difference. However, like Ostlund et al. (1982), we found a reduced maximal binding capacity in the FH 295 cells
(Tolleshaug et al., 1982; Figures 7 and 8 in this paper). The
mechanism for this reduced binding capacity is not clear.
The binding of monoclonal antibody IgG-C7 is reduced in
proportion to the reduction in LDL binding (Figures 7 and
8). The maternal allele in the FH 295 cells produces a protein that never reaches the cell surface. Therefore, if the
elongated, paternally derived receptor bound LDL normally, the FH 295 cells should bind approximately 50% of
the normal amount of LDL. The data, however, show that
these cells bind only 15%-250/o of the normal amount of
monoclonal antibody or LDL. It is possible that this binding defect results from a reduction in the number of cell
surface receptors, perhaps owing to reduced production
or decreased stability of the mutant messenger RNA or
protein. It is also possible that a normal amount of receptor is present, but that the mutation somehow occludes
50% of the binding sites for antibody and LDL. Further
studies will be necessary to clarify this point.

Experimental

A consensus
Alu repeat (Deininger et al., 1981)
is shown with left and right internal repeats
(arms). The A and B boxes of the putative RNA
polymerase
Ill promoter within the Alu repeat
(Paolella et al., 1983) are denoted by horizontal
bars. The apparent breakpoints
in the globin
genes (circled numbers) and in the LDL receptor gene (squared
numbers)
are indicated;
breakpoints
that occur within 10 bp of each
other are positioned identically on the Alu repeat. For FH 295, FH 826, and FH 781, the midpoint between the two putative recombination
boundaries
is shown; in each case the boundaries themselves
fell between the A and B
boxes. References
for the globin mutations
are: 1 (Ottolenghi
et al., 1982); 3 (Vanin et al.,
1983); 11 (Jagadeeswaran
et al., 1982); and 13
(Henthorn et al., 1986). References
for the LDL
receptor
mutations
are: 2 (Lehrman
et al.,
1986); 4 and 5, this paper; 6 and 7 (Hobbs et
al., 1986); 9 and 10 (Lehrman et al., 1987a); and
8 and 12 (Lehrman et al., 1985b).

Procedures

Materials
Human LDL (density 1.019-1.063 g/ml) was prepared and labeled with
lz51 as previously
described (Goldstein
et al., 1983). IgG-C7, a mouse
monoclonal
antibody that binds to the LDL receptor of human cells,
was prepared and labeled with lZ51 as previously
described (Beisiegel
et al., 1981). IgG-2001, a control mouse monoclonal
antibody directed
against an irrelevant antigen, was prepared as described
(Tolleshaug
et al., 1982). Human lipoprotein-deficient
serum was prepared
by
ultracentrifugation
(Goldstein
et al., 1983). =P-labeled
nucleotides
were purchased
from New England Nuclear Corporation.
Enzymes
used in cloning, sequencing,
and restriction digestion were purchased
from New England Biolabs (except Asp7l8, Boehringer
Mannheim).
Bacteriophage
)L Charon 35 was obtained from Dr. Phil Tucker of the
University of Texas Health Science Center at Dallas, Dallas, TX. E. coli
host strain DB1255 (relevant genetic markers, recBC-,
sbcB-) was
kindly provided by Dr. Arlene Wyman of the Massachusetts
Institute of
Technology,
Boston, MA. I DNA packaging extracts (Gigapack)
were
purchased
from Vector Cloning Systems. Ml3 replicative
form (RF)
DNAs were purchased
from PL Biochemicals.
Genomic
Cloning
High molecular weight DNA (50 pg) was isolated from skin fibroblasts
of FH 295 and digested for 3 hr at JPC with a 3-fold excess of BamHl
(Lehrman et al., 1985a, 1985b). The digested DNA was extracted with
a mixture of phenol and chloroform
(1 :I) and then chloroform,
precipitated with 70% ethanol and 96 mM sodium acetate, and dissolved
in
100 ~1 of 10 mM Tris-chloride
and 1 mM sodium EDTA at pH 7.5. The
DNA was fractionated
by centrifugation
through a 10%-40%
sucrose
gradient. Fractions from the gradient were subjected to Southern blotting with a uniformly 32P-labeled single-stranded
cDNA probe (Church
and Gilbert, 1984) corresponding
to exons 4 and 5 of the LDL receptor
gene (Yamamoto et al., 1984; Siidhof et al., 1985a). Aliquots (30 ng)
of fractions containing the desired 13 kb BamHl fragment were mixed
with 0.15 @g of BamHI-digested
arms of I Charon 35 (Loenen and Blattner, 1983) and incubated (16 hr, 14’C) with 490 U of T4 DNA ligase. The
ligated material was packaged into h. phage particles in vitro to yield
a total of 1.4 x iti plaque-forming
units and screened in E. coli strain
D81255. One recombinant
clone designated
IFH 295-22 was identified by hybridization
with a cDNA probe that hybridizes to exons 4 and
5 of the receptor gene (Siidhof et al., 1985a). The insert was excised
at the vector
BamHl sites and subcloned
into BamHI-digested
pBR322. A restriction map of the cloned insert was generated by stan-

Cell
834

dard techniques
(Maniatis et al., 1982) to verify that the size of the insert (13 kb) was in agreement with that measured by Southern blotting
of FH 295 genomic DNA.

DNA Sequencing
The relevant sequence of intron 1 from the normal gene was obtained
through the subcloning
of a 1 kb Sphl-Sspl
fragment and a 0.15 kb
Taql-Sspl fragment from a genomic clone spanning introns 1 through
6 (I.25) (Siidhof et al., 1985a) into Smal- and Sphl-digested
M13mp19
replicative form DNA or Smal-digested
Ml3mpl8 replicative form DNA,
respectively,
and sequencing
with a universal
primer and dideoxynucleotides
(Sanger et al., 1977; Messing, 1983). The relevant sequence of intron 8 from the normal gene was obtained as follows: (1)
a 0.6 kb Nhel-BamHI
fragment from 121 (Sudhof et al., 1985a) was
cloned into Xbal- and BamHI-digested
Ml3mpl8 replicative form DNA
and sequenced
with a universal primer and dideoxynucleotides
and (2)
the Nhel site of a 0.6 kb Nhel-BamHI
fragment
was labeled with
[3zP]dCTP and the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase
and
sequenced
by the method of Maxam and Gilbert (1980). The sequence
of the recombination
joint of XFH 295-22 was obtained by subcloning
a 0.9 kb Sphl-Pvull
fragment and a 0.15 kb Nhel-Sspl
fragment of 1FH
295-22 into Smal- and Sphl-digested
M13mpl9 replicative form DNA
or Smal- and Xbal-digested
Ml3mp18 replicative
form DNA, respectively, and sequencing
with a universal primer.
LDL Receptor
Assays
Diploid fibroblasts
were obtained from skin biopsy specimens
and
grown in monolayer culture at 3PC in a 5% CO* incubator. For metabolic experiments,
about 5 x lo4 cells from stock cultures
were
seeded into 60 mm Petri dishes according
to a standard protocol and
cultured for 5 days (Goldstein et al., 1983). Maximal synthesis
of LDL
receptors
was then induced
by incubation
in human lipoproteindeficient serum for 48 hr prior to study, as described
elsewhere (Goldstein et al., 1983). Cell-surface
binding of rz51-LDL and 1251-lgG-C7 by
monolayers
at 4°C was determined
as described
(Beisiegel
et al.,
1981). Binding, internalization,
and degradation
of ‘251-LDL by monolayers at 3pC was determined
using previously
described
methods
(Goldstein
et al., 1983).
