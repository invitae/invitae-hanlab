One feature of the mutations thus far found to be associated with the disease cystic fibrosis (CF) is that many
of them are clustered within the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of the CF transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR). We sought to discover the molecular basis for this clustering by introducing into the two
NBDs of CFTR mutations either mimicking amino acid changes associated with CF or altering residues within
highly conserved motifs. Synthesis and maturation of the mutant CFTR were studied by transient expression
in COS cells. The ability of the altered proteins to generate cyclic AMP-stimulated anion efflux was assessed by
using 6-methoxy-N-(sulfopropyl) quinolinium (SPQ) fluorescence measurements in HeLa cells expressing
mutated plasmids. The results show that (i) all CF-associated mutants, with one exception, lack functional
activity as measured in the SPQ assay, (ii) mutations in NBD1 are more sensitive to the effects of the same amino
acid change than are the corresponding mutations in NBD2, (iii) cells transfected with plasmids bearing
CF-associated mutations commonly but not exclusively lack mature CFTR, (iv) NBD mutants lacking mature
CFTR fail to activate Cl- channels, and (v) the glycosylation of CFTR, per se, is not required for CFTR
function. We reason that the structure of NBD1 itself or of the surrounding domains renders it particularly
sensitive to mutational changes. As a result, most NBD1 mutants, but only a few NBD2 mutants, fail to mature
or lack functional activity. These findings are consistent with the observed uneven distribution of CFTR
missense mutations between NBD1 and NBD2 of CF patients.

Mutations in a gene encoding a protein called the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) are
responsible for the disease cystic fibrosis (CF) (14, 25, 26).
This was confirmed by showing that transfected full-length
cDNA encoding CFTR was able to complement the defect in
Cl- channel regulation which is characteristic of epithelial
cells from CF patients (8, 24). Although the protein product
of the CF-associated gene has been identified, little is known
about its biochemical function. Data obtained to date are
consistent with the prediction that CFTR is a membraneassociated glycoprotein which can be phosphorylated in
vitro (3, 9).
Amino acid sequence analysis and homology with other
proteins suggest that CFTR consists of two repeats of a unit
containing six membrane-spanning segments and a putative
nucleotide-binding fold (25). The two repeats are separated
by a large polar segment called the R (regulatory)-domain
because it contains multiple potential phosphorylation sites.
The overall structure of CFTR, with the exception of the
R-domain, resembles that of a number of other integral
membrane proteins such as the human and mouse multidrug
resistance P-glycoproteins (MDR) and the protein encoded
by the yeast STE6 gene. Models for the structure of the
nucleotide-binding folds have been proposed (12, 21).
Recent studies showed that the expression of CFTR in a
variety of heterologous cells generates cyclic AMP (cAMP)*

activated Cl- currents which were not present in untransfected cells (1, 13). The simplest interpretation of these
results is that CFTR is itself a cAMP-activated Cl- channel.
The definitive demonstration of this will require additional
experiments, such as the use of isolated lipid bilayers
containing highly purified CFTR or by mutagenesis of amino
acids potentially involved in ion selectivity.
Studies of the biosynthesis of CFTR in transfected cells
identified a defect associated with a number of CF mutations, including the most common, AF508 (3). Following
synthesis, wild-type CFTR was shown to be processed by
addition of complex carbohydrate. By contrast, several
mutated versions of CFTR failed to yield the fully glycosylated form of the protein (referred to as band C). It was
proposed that addition of carbohydrate to wild-type CFTR
occurs in a two-step process: partial glycosylation in the
endoplasmic reticulum, followed by complete glycosylation
in the Golgi. Further, because mutations cause structural
alterations, some forms of mutant CFTR are recognized as
abnormal and rejected by a quality control mechanism
located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Consequently, they
are unable to move through the normal intracellular trafficking pathway. As a result, such mutants do not reach the
Golgi, are not fully glycosylated, and are observed as an
immature, partially glycosylated form called band B. This
process of quality control is common to a number of secreted
and transmembrane proteins, which when incorrectly folded
or assembled fail to progress through the secretory pathway
(11, 16, 20, 23, 27). In the case of CFTR, this interpretation

would mean that most cases of CF are caused by the absence
of mature CFTR at the correct cellular location. Although no
accurate localization of endogenous CFTR has been reported, immunolocalization of wild-type and mutant CFTR
in recombinant cells is consistent with this hypothesis (3),
and functional assays strongly suggest that at least some
CFTR is present in the plasma membrane at the apical
surface (32).
One interesting observation arising from studies on CFassociated mutations is the preponderance of identified
mutations which map to nucleotide-binding domain 1
(NBD1) as opposed to NBD2 (4-7, 15, 17, 22) (Fig. 1). In
addition, we recently showed that mutation of a homologous
amino acid residue within NBDs 1 and 2 of CFTR resulted in
different effects on CFTR maturation (3). These observa-

tions suggested to us that the frequency of CF-associated
mutations within the NBDs might reflect an underlying
sensitivity of NBD1 to functional inactivation or maturational blockage. To examine this possibility, we have studied
not only the maturation of additional mutant CFTR molecules but also their function as measured by halide ion efflux
in transfected cells. The studies were designed to determine
how mutations affect function and how equivalent mutations
in the two NBDs affect both processing and Cl- transport.
We hoped, thereby, to learn the contributions that the two
NBDs make to CFTR function and to determine the molecular basis of the uneven distribution of mutations associated
with CF between the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal
NBDs. To this end, we have introduced paired mutations
into a number of sites within the two NBDs of CFTR. Some

mutations were introduced into residues altered in the DNA
of CF patients, whereas others were in amino acids conserved in other NBD-containing proteins.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In vitro mutagenesis procedures and plasmid constructions.
Site-directed mutagenesis of CFTR and construction of
expression vectors were performed as described previously
(3), using standard methods for recombinant DNA manipulations and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (18, 28).
Briefly, pMT-CFTR, a plasmid vector for CFTR expression
in mammalian cells, was constructed by placing CFTR
cDNA sequences from the AvaI site at position 122 in the
cDNA sequence to the Sacl site at position 4620 into the
unique BglII site of the expression vector pSC-CEV1, using
synthetic adaptor sequences (3). In pMT-CFTR, expression
of CFTR is controlled by the flanking mouse metallothionein
I promoter and simian virus 40 early polyadenylation signal.
The previously described high-copy-number CFTR plasmid
pTM-CFTR-4 was used for all site-directed mutagenesis
procedures (3). CFTR mutations were verified by DNA
sequencing, restriction analysis, and in vitro translation.
Mutants constructed in the pTM-CFTR-4 background were
directly tested for activity in the 6-methoxy-N-(sulfopropyl)
quinolinium (SPQ) assay as described below. For expression
in COS-7 cells, CFTR cDNA mutants were transferred to
pMT-CFTR as described previously (3). Mutations occurring before codon 1270 of CFTR were transferred from
pTM-CFTR-4 to pMT-CFTR on a 3.5-kb XbaI-to-BstXI
restriction fragment, and those occurring after codon 1270
were transferred on a 0.65-kb BstXI-to-XhoI restriction
fragment. Transient expression of CFTR in COS-7 cells was
performed essentially as described elsewhere (28).
Immunoprecipitations and protein phosphorylation using
protein kinase A. Our procedures for preparation of cell
lysates, immunoprecipitation of CFTR, in vitro phosphorylation, and SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate)-gel electrophoresis
have all been described elsewhere (3, 9). For in vitro labeling
of CFTR, immunoprecipitates were incubated with 20 ng of
protein kinase A (Sigma) and 10 ,uCi of [y-32P]ATP in 50 ,ul
of kinase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl) [pH 7.5], 10 mM MgCl2,
100 ,ug of bovine serum albumin per ml) at 30° C for 60 min.
The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of RIPA
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton
X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Labelled
CFTR immunoprecipitates were analyzed by electrophoresis
on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (19).
Assessment of anion permeability. Our procedures for
expression of CFTR by using the vaccinia-T7 hybrid expression system and for assessment of Cl- permeability by using
the halide-sensitive fluorophore SPQ have been described in
detail elsewhere (1, 24). Briefly, HeLa cells were infected
with recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3 (multiplicity of
infection of 10 to 20) to produce bacteriophage T7 RNA
polymerase. Following infection, the cells were transfected
with plasmid (5 ,ug) containing wild-type or mutant CFTR
coding sequences preceded by the T7 promoter. Cells were
loaded with SPQ by including the dye in the medium and
were studied 8 to 14 h after transfection. SPQ fluorescence
was quenched by equilibration of the cells in Nal buffer.
Cells were stimulated by addition of 20 ,uM forskolin and 100
,uM isobutylmethyl xanthine to increase intracellular cAMP.
SPQ fluorescence was measured before and following substitution of 1- for NO3 in the bathing medium. The change

ulated and unstimulated conditions was included as a control
for each mutant. Data are presented as percent fluorescence,
which is 100 x [(F, - FO)/(F17 5- Fo)], where Fo, F175, and
F, are fluorescence intensities at time zero, 17.5 min, and
time t, respectively.
In a few studies, we also measured membrane currents
with the standard whole-cell patch clamp technique (1, 10).
For G1349D CFTR mutants, the pipette contained 120 mM
N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG), 5 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 3 mM MgCl2,
1 mM CsEGTA, and 1 mM MgATP, pH 7.2 (117.5 mM HCl).
The external bath solution contained 140 mM NMDG, 10
mM HEPES, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM
dextrose, pH 7.2 (135 mM HCl). Membrane voltage was
maintained at -60 mV and depolarized to +80 mV for 500
ms every 4 s. For K1250M CFTR mutants, the pipette
contained 120 mM NMDG, 115 mM aspartic acid, 5 mM
HEPES, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CsEGTA, and 1 mM MgATP,
pH 7.2 (5.8 mM HCl). Membrane voltage was maintained at
-80 mV and depolarized to +80 mV for 500 ms every 4 s.
HeLa cells were studied 12 to 15 h after transfection. Series
resistance and cell capacitance were compensated as described previously (1). Cells were studied at 30 to 35° C.
RESULTS
CFTR mutants. The mutations introduced into the NBDs
of CFTR cDNA are shown in Fig. 1A, together with the
CF-associated mutations that have been identified in these
regions of the protein (Fig. 1B). The NBD mutations fall into
three subregions: (i) those around the first Walker motif
(Walker A) (31), characterized by several conserved glycines
and a lysine residue; (ii) those upstream of and including the
second Walker motif (Walker B), which consists of a short
stretch of hydrophobic residues followed by a conserved
aspartic acid; and (iii) the region around the most common
CF-associated mutation (AF508). The sequences around
residue 508 in Fig. 1A and B are arranged differently from
the alignment proposed by Riordan et al. (25). The alignment
used here was generated to maximize homology of NBD2,
not only with NBD1 of CFTR but also with the NBD regions
of other related proteins such as MDR and STE6 (Fig. 1C).
The new alignment reveals a greater degree of conservation
than does that published earlier.
In the Walker A sequences, we mutated to methionine the
conserved lysine residue at amino acid 464 in NBD1 and at
1250 in NBD2; neither of these mutations is known to be
associated with CF. By convention, these mutations are
referred to as K464M and K1250M, where K and M stand for
lysine and methionine, respectively, using the single-letter
amino acid code. Upstream of Walker B, we made the
mutations S549R and S5491, both of which are CF associated
but relatively rare (5, 15). In NBD2 we made the equivalent
S1347R mutation, which is not known to be CF associated.
Mutations G551D and G1349D map to the equivalent conserved glycine in NBD1 and -2, respectively, and both are
reported to be CF associated (5, 16a). A559T is CF associated (5), but its NBD2 equivalent A1357T is not reported to
be CF associated. D572N and D1370N are not CF associated
but alter the conserved aspartic acid in the Walker B
sequence.
In the 508 region we deleted phenylalanine residue 508
(AF508) and also made A1507, a rare CF-associated mutation
(15), F508C, which is reported to be a normal human
polymorphism (17), and F508R, which represents a nonconservative amino acid change that is not known to be CF

associated (3). In NBD2 we made AF1296, which in the
published amino acid alignment (25) is equivalent to the
deletion at 508. In the same region of NBD2 we also made
N1303K, which is CF associated (22). We also removed both
potential glycosylation sites in CFTR to generate the mutation N894,900Q (3).
The mutations were introduced into a full-length CFTR
cDNA by standard methods (18). Previously described vectors were used for CFTR mutagenesis and for CFTR expression in the vaccinia virus and COS cell systems (3, 9, 24).
Expression of mutant CFTR in COS cells. Figure 2 shows
analysis of CFTR in COS cells 48 h after DNA transfection.
CFTR was detected by addition of protein kinase A to
washed immunoprecipitates made from extracts of the transfected cells, using monoclonal antibody 13.1 as described
previously (3). The affinity of this antibody for CFTR is not
measurably affected by either glycosylation of CFTR or the
state of phosphorylation of the R-domain (2a, 3). Mature
fully glycosylated CFTR is detected in this assay as a diffuse
band (band C) migrating with an apparent molecular weight
of 150,000 under our gel electrophoresis conditions. The
primary translation product of CFTR, lacking any carbohydrate (band A), migrates more rapidly (apparent molecular
weight of approximately 130,000) than band C, and partially
glycosylated CFTR (band B) migrates with an intermediate
mobility (apparent molecular weight of approximately
135,000).
Previously we reported that band C is absent from extracts
of cells transfected with N894,900Q, the mutant lacking
glycosylation sites (3). Instead the primary translation product, band A, is detected. Of mutations within NBD1, we
previously showed that extracts from cells transfected with
K464M, A1507, AF508, F508R, and S5491 lack band C but
contain band B. We also showed that extracts from cells
transfected with NBD1 mutant G551D contain band C (3;
Fig. 2). Figure 2 shows that the additional NBD1 mutants
S549R, A559T, and D572N directed synthesis of band B but
not band C CFTR. F508C, the NBD1 polymorphism, clearly
makes band C, though possibly at somewhat reduced
amounts.

Within NBD2, we had previously shown that cells containing mutant K1250M make band C (3; Fig. 2). Figure 2
shows that NBD2 mutants S1347R, G1349D, A1357T, and

D1370N also direct synthesis of apparently normal levels of
band C CFTR. However, extracts of cells transfected with
NBD2 mutant N1303K contain only band B CFTR. Although in Fig. 2 little band C is visible in cells transfected
with the AF1296 mutant of CFTR, additional experiments
consistently showed that cells transfected with this mutant
make small but detectable amounts of band C.
The expression data (summarized in Table 1) show that
mutations in NBD1 are more sensitive to the effects of the
same amino acid change than are mutations in NBD2, as

b The convention for naming mutants is as follows: the amino acid normally
found at the particular residue, the residue number (25), and the amino acid to
which the residue was converted. The single-letter amino acid code is used.
Thus, K464M is a mutant in which lysine 464 is converted to methionine.

FIG. 3. Functional assay of CFTR mutants by SPQ fluorescence. The change in fluorescence of SPQ-loaded HeLa cells expressing
wild-type or mutant CFTR is shown following substitution of N03 for l- in the bathing medium. Cells were stimulated with 20 ,M forskolin
and 100 ,M isobutylmethyl xanthine for 7 min prior to ion substitution. Data are means standard errors of representative experiments for
each mutant (CFTR, n = 33; AF508, n = 27; G551D, n = 40; G1349D, n = 52; K464M, n = 25; K1250M, n = 20; D572N, n = 6; D1370N,
n = 7; N1303K, n = 40; AF1296, n = 18; where n = number of cells). Mutants were tested for function by using the SPQ assay with at least
three different cell preparations. Values for each pair of mutants are significantly different (P < 0.001), except for the D-to-N pair of mutants,

measured by the appearance of band C. In addition, the data
extends our previous observation that cells transfected with
CF-associated mutants commonly but not exclusively lack
mature CFTR.
Functional assay for CFTR activity. To measure the function of the CFTR variants, we used the SPQ immunofluorescence assay in vaccinia virus-infected HeLa cells transfected with mutant plasmids (1, 24). Approximately 12 h
after infection, SPQ-loaded cells were equilibrated in an Nal
buffer. We then measured the increase in fluorescence of
SPQ after the Nal buffer was replaced by NaNO3 buffer (1quenches SPQ fluorescence but N03 does not). The increase in fluorescence was measured in the presence and
absence of cAMP. Representative data are shown in Fig. 3.
We have previously shown that a cAMP-induced increase in
the rate of fluorescence change results from activation of Clchannels (1, 24).
Table 1 summarizes the results. A number of the mutations, especially those in NBD2 (F508C, N894,900Q,
K1250M, AF1296, S1347R, G1349D, and A1357T) retain

D572N and its NBD2 equivalent D1370N, and N1303K) lack
activity. For mutations K1250M and G1349D, the SPQ data
were confirmed by patch clamp measurements using the
methods previously described (1, 10) (Fig. 4). In both cases,
addition of cAMP reversibly stimulated Cl- current.
The functional assay data are striking for two reasons.
First, all CF-associated mutations, with the exception of
G1349D, are negative in the functional assay. Second, mutations in NBD1 lead to functional inactivation more often
than do the equivalent mutations in NBD2.

DISCUSSION

The absence of mature CFTR correlates with failure to
activate the chloride channel. The data in Table 1 show that
with the exception of the synthetic glycosylation site mutant
N894,900Q, mutants that fail to make band C also fail to
generate cAMP-activated Cl- channels. We believe that this
result is predictable since we earlier suggested that the
absence of band C reflects the failure of some mutant CFTR
species to traffic normally through the cell (3). We propose
that such mutants are rejected in the endoplasmic reticulum
by a cellular quality control mechanism. If this is the case, a
mutant unable to make band C is one that is recognized by
the quality control mechanism, and consequently cannot
transport normally and cannot mature. Inevitably, such
mutants will not progress to the plasma membrane and will
lack functional activity at the cell surface.
Although all mutants except N894,900Q which lack the
ability to make band C also lack functional activity, the
corollary is not true; that is, all mutants associated with CF
do not lack band C. We previously showed that G551D and
the transmembrane 6 mutant R334W (3) both make apparently normal amounts of band C. Here we also demonstrate
this for G1349D. This result means that not all mutations in
CFTR result in effects that are recognized by the cellular
quality control mechanism. In these cases, intracellular
trafficking and maturation proceed normally, but nevertheless the protein is defective, presumably because a residue
crucial to protein function is altered. It is also important to
recognize that many mutations reported to be associated
with CF are very rare, and in some cases insufficient
evidence exists to prove formally that a given mutation

causes CF. G1349D is a case in point; this CFTR mutant is
functional in our assays, suggesting the possibility that there
are other, undiscovered mutations on the CF allele carrying
G1349D and that these uncharacterized mutations cause CF.
Carbohydrate addition per se is not necessary for CFTR
function. The data presented here indicate that even though
inactive mutants commonly lack complete glycosylation,
carbohydrate addition is not necessary for the function of
CFTR. N894,900Q retains anion transport function even
though it makes no band B or band C. We interpret this
finding to mean that this mutant is able to traffic normally
through the cell. This emphasizes that the quality control
mechanism that detects other mutants does not recognize
defective glycosylation, but rather lack of complete glycosylation is a consequence of rejection. We conclude that
glycosylation is not essential for CFTR to get to its site of
action or to generate cAMP-activated Cl- channels. Other
examples in which interference with the normal glycosylation of a transmembrane protein does not affect intracellular trafficking of that protein have been reported. For example, a deglycosylated version of the muscarinic acetylcholine
receptor has been shown to be correctly localized and
functional at the plasma membrane (30).
Abnormal chloride channel function does not prevent glycosylation of CFTR. The results with mutants that are
inactive yet still produce band C provide evidence that
defective function of CFTR does not prevent its own glycosylation. G551D is a naturally occurring CF mutation, and
expression of G551D fails to increase cAMP-dependent

halide permeability yet still produces band C. Similarly,
D1370N, which affects a highly conserved aspartic acid in
the Walker B motif of NBD2, lacks activity in the SPQ assay
yet produces band C. We conclude that the absence of
complete glycosylation of certain CFTR mutants does not
result from lack of cAMP-activated Cl- channel activity.
NBD1 is more susceptible than NBD2 to the effects of
mutation. In the series of mutations presented in Table 1, it
is clear that equivalent mutations in NBD1 and NBD2 do not
have equivalent consequences in the assays used here. Eight
of nine mutations in NBD1 (excluding the polymorphism
F508C) but only one of seven mutations in NBD2 fail to
make detectable band C. Likewise, all of the mutations in
NBD1 tested (except F508C) abolish cAMP-stimulated anion permeability, but only two of seven mutations in NBD2
are inactive. Thus, mutations in NBD1 are at best equal to,
but usually more severe than, the equivalent mutations in
NBD2. Strikingly, these results reflect the observed uneven
distribution of CF-associated mutations within CFTR. Of the
15 missense mutations shown in Fig. 1B, only 3 are found in
NBD2 whereas 12 are present in NBD1. Thus, the molecular
basis for the frequency of CF-associated mutations within
the NBDs would seem to be the increased sensitivity of
NBD1 mutations to the quality control mechanism or functional inactivation. We suggest that this difference reflects
either the different sequences within the NBDs themselves
or else differences in the adjacent domains with which they
may interact. In this regard, it is notable that the sequence
homology between NBD1 and NBD2 in CFTR is much less

3892

than for other proteins of similar overall structure with
duplicate NBDs. Interestingly, the results discussed above
contrast with those of similar studies on the NBDs of MDR,
in which equivalent mutations in the two domains generally
have the same effect on function (2).
Given that mutations in the two NBDs affect maturation
unequally, we believe that at least some of the differences in
functional properties of mutants in the two domains are
predictable. NBD1 mutants generally do not make band C;
consequently, any potential partial activity of an NBD1
mutant is masked because it does not reach the correct
cellular destination at which activity is measurable. The
equivalent NBD2 mutants, by contrast, generally appear to
escape the quality control mechanism and do make band C.
Presumably, at least some of the NBD2 mutant CFTR is
present at the plasma membrane, and this material, even
though mutant, may in certain cases have measurable activity. Consider, for example, the paired mutations (K464M
and K1250M) in the conserved lysine in Walker A, where
K464M does not make band C and is functionally inactive
whereas K1250M does make band C and retains functional
activity. The differences observed do not necessarily mean
that the functions of the two domains (say, in nucleotide
binding) are different. Rather, residual activity of K464M
may be masked by incorrect subcellular location, whereas
partial activity of K1250M may be magnified by the nonquantitative nature of the functional assay and expression
system (see below). Similar arguments apply to other pairs
of mutations.
Another factor that might emphasize differences in activity between NBD1 and NBD2 mutants is the expression
system and functional assay. Of the mutants that make band
C, we show that six of eight retain measurable anion
transport function. However, because neither the SPQ assay
nor the measurement of Cl- currents with the patch clamp is
completely quantitative (note our previous description of the
heterogeneous response with use of the vaccinia virus hybrid
expression system [1, 24]), we cannot conclude that functional mutants are completely wild type and retain 100%
activity. Indeed, the apparent full activity of AF1296, which
in COS-7 cells makes much less band C than does the wild
type, and of G1349D, which is reported to be associated with
CF, suggests that in some cases our expression system and
functional assay may not allow discrimination of partially
functional from fully functional mutants. It is also possible
that the high level of expression of CFTR in the HeLa and
COS-7 cells might influence the assays to mask some functional defects.
What is the function of the NBDs? The results presented
above do not allow us to unambiguously ascertain the
biochemical properties of the NBDs. However, very recently Thomas et al. (29) showed that a synthetic peptide
including the Walker A motif of NBD1 interacts with adenine nucleotides. Assuming, as seems probably, that both
conserved Walker motifs are associated with nucleotide
binding, it is important to note that two steps are likely
involved: first, the binding or hydrolysis of nucleotide and
second, the functional consequences that result from nucleotide binding or hydrolysis. If this reasoning is correct, even
if NBD1 and NBD2 of CFTR both bind nucleotide, the
functional consequences for CFTR that result from that
binding may be different. Several arguments favor a different
role for the two domains resulting from the different consequences of nucleotide binding. These include the clustering
of CF-associated mutations and the differential effects reported here of seemingly equivalent mutations both on

maturation of CFTR and on Cl- channel activity. However,
the fact that certain mutations in NBD2 do affect CFTR
maturation or Cl- channel activity suggests that the two
NBDs may play similar roles in CFTR function and that the
primary difference between the two NBDs is the greater
susceptibility of NBD1 mutants to detection by the quality
control mechanism. The resolution of these alternative possibilities requires further study.
