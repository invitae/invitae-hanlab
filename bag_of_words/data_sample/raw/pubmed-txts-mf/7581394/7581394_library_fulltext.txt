Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an X-linked neurodegenerative disorder characterized by elevated
very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) levels, reduced activity of peroxisomal VLCFA-CoA ligase, and
variable phenotypic expression. A putative gene for ALD was recently identified and surprisingly
encodes a protein (ALDP) that belongs to a family of transmembrane transporters regulated or activated by ATP (the ABC proteins). We have examined genomic DNA from ALD probands for mutations in the putative ALD gene. We detected large deletions of the carboxyl-terminal portion of the
gene in 4 of 112 probands. Twenty-five of the ALD probands whose ALD genes appeared normal by
Southern blot analysis were surveyed for mutations by Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism
(SSCP) procedures and DNA sequence analysis. SSCP variants were detected in 22 probands and none
in 60 X-chromosomes from normal individuals. Mutations were detected in all of the ALD probands.
The mutations were distributed throughout the gene and did not correlate with phenotype. Approximately half were non-recurrent missense mutations of which 64% occurred in CpG dmucleotides.
There was a cluster of frameshift mutations in a small region of exon 5 , including an identical AG
deletion in 7 unrelated probands. These data strongly support the supposition that mutations in the

INTRODUCTION

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that involves mainly the
adrenal cortex, nervous system white matter and
testis (Moser et al., 1994). The principal biochemical abnormality is the accumulation of saturated
very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA), particularly
hexacosanoic acid, C26:O (Igarashi et al., 1976).
This accumulation is primarily the result of their
impaired degradation in peroxisomes due to reduced activity of the peroxisomal VLCFA Coenzyme A synthetase (VLCS) (Lazo et al., 1989;
Wanders, et al., 1988). The ALD gene was
mapped to Xq28 in 1981 (Migeon et al., 1981) and
a candidate gene was isolated by positional cloning
in 1993 (Mosser et al., 1993). Surprisingly, the
deduced amino acid sequence of the protein
(ALDP) corresponding to the ALD gene suggests

that it is not the VLCS itself, but rather is a member of a super-family of transmembrane transporters, the ATP binding cassette ( A X ) proteins
(Hyde et al., 1990) or traffic ATPases (Mimura et
al., 1991).
The ABC transporter super-family includes
more than 30 known proteins that share significant
sequence homology and have a similar overall
structure (Higgins et al., 1988). All members of
the ABC family whose function is known are
transmembrane channel proteins that participate
in the transport of ligands ranging from ions to

proteins. The striking sequence similarity among
ABC proteins suggests that they are likely to have
common mechanistic features. The best studied
eukaryotic ABC proteins are the mammalian
P-glycoprotein (multiple drug resistance, MDR
(Chen e t al., 1986), the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (Riordan e t
al., 1989), and the product of the yeast STE6 gene
(Kuchler et al., 1989; McGrath et al., 1989).
These molecules are comprised of two homologous
halves, each with six predicted membrane spanning regions and a putative nucleotide binding fold
(NBF). Two highly conserved sequences (Walker
A and B) have been identified at the borders of
each NBF (Walker et al., 1982). Certain ABC
proteins, including the bacterial hemolysin transporter, HlyB (Felmlee e t al., 1985; Mackman et
al., 1986) and the human 70Kd peroxisomal protein, PMP70, (Gartner et al., 1992) are “halftransporter” versions with a single set of six transmembrane regions and a single NBF domain. In
other ABC transporters, including the bacterial
nutrient permeases, the membrane spanning regions and the NBF domains are on separate polypeptides (Ames et al., 1986; Hyde et al., 1990).
ALDP is a “half-transporter” with striking sequence similarity to PMP7O (Mosser et al., 1993).
The gene, comprised of 10 exons, spans approximately 21 Kb of genomic sequence and encodes a
predicted mRNA with an open reading frame of
2,235 bases encoding a protein of 745 amino acids
(Sarde et al., 1994). This gene was initially suggested as a candidate for ALD on the bases of its map
position within Xq28, its sequence similarity with
PMP70 and the occurrence of large deletions in 7%
of the initial population of ALD patients screened
(Mosser et al., 1993). Subsequently, mutations in
the ALD gene have been described in individual
ALD patients (Uchiyama et al., 1994; Cartier et
al., 1993; Contreras et al., 1994; Fanen et al.,
1994) and immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that ALDP is indeed associated with the
peroxisomal membrane (Mosser et al., 1994). In
this paper we examine 112 unrelated ALD patients
for large deletions and systematically determine the
mutations in 25 unrelated ALD probands whose
ALD genes lack gross alterations. The identification of mutations in 24 of these patients provides
additional evidence linking this gene with ALD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The subjects included in this study were selected
from more than 1200 patients with X-linked ALD

105

who have been diagnosed at the Kennedy Krieger
Institute as part of a national screening program.
Diagnosis was based on clinical criteria (Moser et
al., 1994) and the demonstration of abnormally
increased levels of VLCFA in plasma or cultured
skin fibroblasts (Moser et al., 1991; Moser et al.,
1981). Patients were classified as cerebral ALD
(CER: including childhood, adolescent and adult
forms), adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN: including
cases with subsequent cerebral involvement) and
Addison’s only (ADD) (Moser et al., 1994; Moser
et al., 1992; Moser et al., 1989).
We initially screened 112 unrelated patients
and 40 normal individuals for major deletions and
insertions in the ALD gene. Subsequently, 25 apparently intact ALD genes, as judged by Southern
blot analysis, were subjected to detailed mutational
analysis. Table 2 lists their age, ethnic background, phenotype, and kindred phenotypes.
Isolation of Nucleic Acids
Genomic DNA from whole blood, EBV transformed lymphoblasts or fibroblasts and plasmid
DNA from recombinant clones containing partial
cDNAs of ALDP, Ex13 and Ex3 (Mosser et al.,
1993), and the recombinant clone for the microsatellite locus, DXS52, at Xq28 (St14) were isolated by standard procedures (Sambrook et al.,

1989).
Southern Blot Analysis
Genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI, Hind111 or BamHI according to the
conditions described by the supplier (Gibco-BRL:
Gaithersburg, MD) with addition of BSA and spermidine to final concentrations of 100 Fgiml and 4
mM, respectively. The resulting DNA fragments
were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis,
transferred to nylon membranes (Genescreen
Plus, DuPont: Wilmington, DE) in 0.4M NaOH
and probed with partial cDNA clones Ex13 and
Ex3 (Mosser et al., 1993). The probes were labeled
by random primer extension using [321‘]-dCTP
(Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1984) to a specific activity of 2-3 x lo8 c p d p g . Filter hybridization
and washing followed the manufacturers’ suggestions. When necessary to reduce filter background
or the presence of cross reacting DNA fragments
the filters were subjected to two washes in 0.1 x
SSC, 1% SDS at 65°C for 30 min each. The filters
were exposed to Kodak X-Omat film with intensifying screens at -80°C for one to six days. When
a change in a restriction fragment was observed
indicating a deletion, additional hybridizations

were performed using probes specific for each
exon.
PCR
Primers used for amplifying genomic ALD sequences were designed according to the genomic
sequence of the ALD gene (Sarde et al., 1994).
They are listed in Table 1 together with the size of
the amplified fragment. The regions amplified by
this set of primers included the presumptive promoter region, extending 657 BP 5' to the ATG
initiation codon, all 10 exons and flanking intronic sequences, including the splicing branch
point and 100-150 BP of the untranslated 3' sequence. PCR amplifications were performed in an
Ericomp programmable thermal cycler in a volume
of 50 p1 using Ampliwax (Perkin-Elmer Cetus:
Foster City, C A ) in order to achieve a hot start.
Except where noted, 100 ng of genomic DNA was
amplified with the concentration of each primer at
500 nM and each deoxynucleotide at 0.5 mM.
The promoter region and exon 1 of the ALd
gene have a very high GC content and amplify
poorly with Taq polymerase. T h e promoter fragments were amplified in reaction mixtures that
consisted of 2 mM MgCl,, 0.1 mM 7deaza2'GTP,
0.1 mM dGTP, 0.2 mM dATP, dCTP, TTP,
0.1% gelatin, 1% DMSO, and 2.5 U of the Stoffel
fragment of DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus: Foster City, CA). The PCR thermal cycle was:
initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min; 30 cycles of
95°C for 30 sec, 63°C for 40 sec and 72°C for 2 min
with a final extension at 72°C for 7 min.
Exon 1 is approximately 1.5 kb in length and
was amplified in 7 overlapping segments in order to
generate fragments appropriate for mutational
analysis. The reaction mixture was 2.5 mM
MgCl,, 20% sucrose and 2.5 units of the Stoffel
fragment of DNA polymerase. For thermal cycling
the template was first denatured at 95°C fr 3 min
followed by repeated denaturation at 94" for 1 min,
annealing at 68" for 1 min and extension at 72" for
2 min with a final extension at 72" for 7 min.
To improve the yield of this amplification the initial amplification of 35 cycles was followed by a
16 cycle second amplification with a nested
primer.
Exons 2 through 6 were amplified in a reaction
mixture containing 1.25 units of recombinant Taq
polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus: Foster City, C A )
and a final concentration of 1.5 mM MgC1,. Following an initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min,
thermal cycling was for 28 cycles with denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 60°C (exons

2,4,6) or 65°C (exons 3,5) for 1 min, extension at
72" for 2 min with a final extension for 7 min.
All primers designed for examining exons 7
through 10, both intronic and exonic, amplified a
set of autosomal sequences as well as those from
the ALD gene on the X chromosome. Thus, the
first step in the analysis of exons 7-10 was the
generation of an X-specific 4 Kb fragment that extended from the X-specific 5' primer of exon 6 to
a 3' primer in exon 10. This long range PCR was
accomplished using 1 pM of each primer, 1 mM of
each deoxynucleotide, 2.4 mM Mg(OAc),, 20
mM Tricine (pH 8.7), 80 mM KOAc, 1% DMSO,
10% glycerol and 2.5 units of T t h DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus: Foster City, CA) plus
0.025 units of Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs: Beverly, MA). Thermal cycling was: initial
denaturation at 94°C for 20 sec then 35 cycles of
denaturation at 95°C for 10 sec, annealing at 63°C
for 1 min, extension at 72°C for 5 min and a final
extension at 72°C for 15 min. Nested PCR reactions were performed with intronic primers specific
for each of the exons using 0.5 p1 of the initial
PCR product and the same conditions established
for exon 2 with the number of cycles reduced to

18.
Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism
(SSCP) Analysis
This analysis was modified from the procedure
described by Orita et al. (Orita e t al., 1989a; Orita
e t al., 1989b). In brief, 5 to 10 p1 of alkali denatured PCR product was loaded onto a 16 x 20 cm
gel containing 0.75 X MDE (AT Biochem: Malvern, PA) prepared in 1X TBE according to the
manufacturers' instructions. Samples were fractionated using a vertical gel electrophoresis system
(Gibco-BRL: Gaithersburg, MD) at both 4" and
22°C. Gels were stained with silver nitrate (Bassam e t al., 1991) and analyzed for migrational conformers. The migration patterns obtained with patient DNA were always compared with the
patterns achieved with DNA from normal individuals and with DNA from a somatic hybrid cell,
AHA 1l a , in which the only human chromosome
is the X, to confirm that the fragments were from
the X-chromosome.
DNA Sequence Analysis
Variant SSCP migration confomers were sequenced in both directions using a dsDNA cycle
sequencing system (Gibco-BRL: Gaithersburg,
MD), with one labeled primer. The resulting sequence was compared with the sequence obtained

ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY GENE

with DNA from a normal individual and to the
published cDNA sequence (Mosser et al., 1993).
Possible mutations were confirmed by analysis of a
second independent PCR reaction, either by sequence determination or by restriction endonuclease analysis when the putative mutation altered
a restriction site. In patients where no SSCP migration variant was detected the entire gene was
sequenced.

DXS52 (St14) Genotype Analysis

To establish that certain X-chromosomes with
the same mutation had separate origins, alleles at
the highly variable DXS52 locus were determined.
This locus is a mini-satellite that is closely linked
to the ALD locus and is frequently used for pedigree analysis of ALD (Aubourg e t al., 1978).
Southern blots of genomic DNA digested with Taq
I were hybridized with a recombinant probe, St14,
for the locus. St14 was provided by J. Nathans.
Hybridization was as described above.
Antibodies

A synthetic peptide was generated that corresponds to the predicted amino acid residues 728745 in ALDP. This region was chosen because it
was predicted to have a high probability of surface
exposure, high antigenicity (MacVector, IBI: New
Haven, CT) and no similarity with PMP70. The
synthetic peptide was coupled to bovine serum albumin with the bifunctional cross-linking agent
Bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate (BS3; Pierce). Antiserum was raised in rabbits at Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA). Antiserum to this
peptide was used in immunofluorescence experiments on human primary fibroblasts. Cells were
fixed, permeabilized with Triton X-100 and incubated for 1 hour with the anti-peptide antiserum
and then with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson Immuno Research: Westgrove, PA)
(Harlow and Lane, 1988); the cells were examined
by Fluorescence microscopy using Leitz Aristoplan
Microscope.
For double-label immuno-f luorescence studies,
anti-human catalase antibody raised in sheep (Jackson Immuno Research) was included with the antiALDP peptide antiserum and was detected with
LRSC-conjugated anti-sheep IgG antibody (Jackson Immuno Research).

RESULTS
Southern Blot Analysis

To detect major changes in the genomic structure of the ALD gene, we studied DNA from 112
unrelated ALD patients and 60 X-chromosomes

107

from normal individuals. EcoRI, Hind111 and
BamHI digests of genomic DNA were probed with
partial ALDP cDNA clones (Ex13 and Ex3) that
together span exons 2 through 9 (Mosser et al.,
1993). Both of these probes detect several DNA
fragments in each digest, only some of which are
from the X-linked ALD locus. The cross reacting
fragments remained after stringent washing of the
filters. The identity of the X-chromosome fragments was determined by comparison to the pattern of hybridizing bands obtained with DNA from
a somatic hybrid cell line (AHA1l a ) in which the
only human chromosome is the X. N o restriction
fragment size changes were observed in the controls. In four patients (41112 = 3.6%) deletions
affecting the 3’ region of the gene were observed.
The deletions are diagrammed in Fig. 1. Their
clinical and pedigree information is included in
Table 2. The 3’ end of the deletion was beyond the
end of the gene in each case and was not determined. No deletions altering exons 1 or 2, that
code for the putative transmembrane segments of
ALDP, were detected. The presence and absence
of the exons indicated in Figure 1 were confirmed
by hybridization with PCR probes specific for each
exon. The frequency and pattern of deletions in
this population of patients are similar to those described in the initial population examined (Mosser
et al., 1993).

SSCP Analysis
A detailed mutational analysis was undertaken
in 25 of the 108 unrelated probands that had intact
ALD genes by Southern blot analysis. The remaining probands from the original group of 112 have
not yet been examined. Clinical and pedigree information on these individuals is included in Table
2 together with results of the mutation study. One
patient was adopted. Seven of the others were the
only known affected individuals in their kindred.
These included all three ALD phenotypes. Patient
23 had a new mutation since the mutation was not
present in his mother. The remaining patients
were members of kindreds with multiple affected
individuals. In three instances all had AMN but
the other kindreds had a mixture of phenotypes
(see Table 2). The plasma levels of VLCFA
((2260) are not correlated with either the ALD
phenotype or the type or position of the mutation.
In order to minimize the amount of DNA sequencing required to identify mutations, all patient DNA was initially examined by SSCP analysis of ALD specific PCR fragments to determine
the approximate location of possible mutations.

PCR amplification of promoter sequences and exons 1 through 6 from genomic DNA generated
single X-specific products. PCR amplification of
exons 7-10 individually from genomic DNA, using
either exonic or intronic primers, gave single
bands of the expected sizes when assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis. However, when these PCR
products were assayed by SSCP several bands were
observed suggesting that both exonic and intronic
primers were amplifying autosomal sequences in
addition to those of the X-linked ALD gene. This
was confirmed by SSCP analysis of exons 7
through 10 amplified from AHAl l a where a single
pair of bands from the X-chromosome was detected
(Fig. 2). Thus, the apparent single PCR fragment
generated from genomic DNA is a mixture of frag-

ments from several chromosomes. There is remarkable sequence identity (>97%) among the X-chromosome and autosomal sequences (data not
shown). In order to detect mutations in this region
of the ALD gene, we first amplified a 4Kb X-specific PCR fragment using an X-specific primer in
exon 6 and a reverse primer in exon 10. Nested
primers specific for each exon were then used to
amplify PCR fragments for SSCP analysis and subsequent DNA sequencing if appropriate. These
nested PCR products for exons 7 through 10 were
X-specific as judged by comparison with results obtained with DNA from AHAl la. A comparison of
the SSCP patterns obtained by direct and nested
PCR amplification of exon 7 is shown in Figure 2.
No SSCP migration variants were observed with

PCR products from normal individuals. SSCP migrational conformers were detected in all but 3 of
the 25 ALD patients examined, approximately
90%. In addition a silent nucleotide change
present in one of the patients also generated a
SSCP variant. An example of SSCP variants obtained with exon 5 is shown in Figure 3.
ALD Mutations
Examples of the DNA sequence changes resulting in ALD mutations are shown in Figure 4. All of
the ALD mutations determined in this study are
listed in Table 2 and diagrammed in Figure 5. Mutations were found widely distributed through the
gene but none were detected in the promoter region, in the untranslated part of the predicted
mRNA or in exons 2, 4 and 10. Fourteen single
nucleotide substitutions were found. One was a G
to A change at the splice donor site of exon 3, one
resulted in a stop codon in exon 5, one was a
synonomous change, and the remainder were all
missense mutations. One patient had two single bp

substitutions, one producing a silent mutation and
the other a missense mutation. Frameshift mutations were detected in 10 patients. Unexpectedly,
seven of these were an identical AG deletion at
nucleotide position 1415/16 in exon 5 (Figure 6).
Five AG deletions were detected in an initial
screen of 22 ALD patients. Subsequently, we examined another 35 of the original probands by
SSCP for mutations in exon 5. We found two additional cases with the AG deletion and one patient with an adjacent AA deletion. Thus, 7 of 57
patients (approximately 12%) examined in this
study have an identical AG deletion in exon 5 and
2 additional patients (nos. 10 and 11) also have a
small insertion or deletion in the same region. As
indicated in Table 2, these patients have different
ethnic backgrounds. They also have distinguishable X-chromosomes as judged by the presence of
different DXS52 alleles (data not shown). Interestingly, each of the three ALD phenotypes is
present among the individuals with this dinucleotide deletion.

Three ALD patients had normal SSCP patterns
for all regions of the gene examined. The entire
ALD gene was sequenced in each patient, including the promoter region from -657 to the ATG
initiation codon, each exon and 30 to 100 bp of
their flanking intronic sequence, including each of
the splice branch points, and 300 bp of the 3’
untranslated portion of exon 10. In one, patient
no. 9, a nonsense mutation was found. N o mutation was found in the other two patients.
It should be noted that DNA sequnce analysis of
exon 1 from an ALD gene derived from a cosmid
clone and from normal and patient genes isolated
from the collection at the Kennedy Krieger Institute consistently differed from the published sequence (Mosser et al., 1993). In these samples
nucleotide 368 was a T rather than a C resulting in
an amino acid change, A123V, that presumably is
a normal variant.

Anti-serum raised against a synthetic peptide
predicted from the sequence of the ALD gene was
used to examine fibroblasts from a normal individuals and 3 ALD patients for the presence and subcellular distribution of ALDP. The results are
shown in Fig. 7. In panel A the expected punctate
staining of peroxisomes (Gould et al., 1989) is
seen with anti ALDP antibody. Panel B shows the
same cells as panel A reacted simultaneously with
anti-catalase antibody. T h e identity of punctate
staining seen with the two antibodies confirms that
this anti-ALDP antibody recognizes peroxisomes
and is consistent with the localization of ALDP to
the peroxisome. Panel C shows the reaction of
anti-ALDP antibody with fibroblasts from a normal subject. Panel D shows a negative reaction
obtained with fibroblasts from a patient (Table 2,
no. 29) with a major ALD deletion. Panels E and
F show fibroblasts from the patients without detectable ALD mutations. The patient shown in
panel F (Table 2, no. 24) is clearly deficient for
ALDP associated with peroxisomes while the patient in panel E (Table 2, no. 25) has a normal
pattern of ALDP antibody staining.
DISCUSSION
We have undertaken a detailed mutational
analysis of the ALD gene in 25 unrelated ALD
patients. The most significant observation is that
the vast majority of patients with X-linked ALD
have mutations in the ALD gene. In a series of 112
unrelated ALD patients we confirmed the earlier
results of Mosser e t al. (Mosser et al., 1993) that a
small fraction of ALD patients (3.6% in this study)

at nucleotide 1850resulting in the substitution of histidine for
a highly conserved arginine in the ATP binding domain,

their gene. Each deletion was unique but all included the ATP binding domain.
The relationship of this gene, with its presumed
transport function, to the biochemical abnormality
of ALD, characterized by elevated levels of VLCFA
due to a failure of their beta-oxidation in peroxisomes, is uncertain. In principle, mutational anal-

ysis of the gene could provide insights into its function.
In this survey of 25 unrelated X-linked ALD
patients with intact ALD genes, we identified mutations in 24. Approximately 88% (22125) were
detected by SSCP. Two of the individuals without
a SSCP variant did not have a mutation is the gene

subject is shown on the right and that from patient 12 on the

FIGURE 6. DNA

With the exception of the seven patients with
the AG dinucleotide deletion in exon 5, each patient had a unique mutation. Thus no single recurrent mutation suggesting an important functional domain was observed. T h e identified
mutations included one presumptive splice site
mutation, one nonsense mutation and a silent mutation. The remainder of the mutations were either
missense or frameshift changes. All of these mutations occurred within the coding region of the
gene. We did not find mutations in the promoter
region 5’ to the translation start codon, in the
untranslated portion of the last exon or in intronic
sequences. An intronic mutation can be inferred
in patient no. 24 (see below) but has not yet been
demonstrated. The frameshift mutations all result
in premature termination and thus would lack a
functional protein. In most instances the putative
missense mutations have been identified solely o n
the basis of predicted amino acid substitutions and
need to be confirmed by functional studies. Missense mutations accounted for 44% (11/25) of the
ALD patients examined in detail. This is comparable to the situation in the cystic fibrosis gene
(CFTR) where missense mutations are about 50%
of the total (Tsui, 1992). Frameshift mutations,
which include one single nucleotide insertion and
9 dinucleotide deletions, accounted for 40% of the
observed ALD sequence changes in this group of
ALD patients.
Missense mutations should be the most informative for inferring functional domains in the protein. Five missense mutations were found in re-

Analysis of ALDP in fibroblasts. Panels A and B
show double-label indirect immunofluorescence of control
human fibroblasts with anti-ALDPand anti-catalase antibodies. Fibroblasts were permeabilized with Triton X-100 and
incubated with both antibodies as described in methods.
Panel A shows detection of ALDP with FITC-conjugated antirabbit antibody and Panel B detection of catalase with
LRSC-conjugated anti-sheep antibody. The punctate immunofluorescence patterns are identical, indicating that the
anti-ALDP antibody recognizes a peroxisomal protein. Panel
C and D compares the immunofluorescence patterns of fibroblasts from a normal subject (C) and a patient (29) with a
major ALD gene deletion demonstrating the antibody is specific for ALDP. Panels E and F display the immunofluorescence patterns in fibroblasts from 2 ALD patients (25and 24,
respectively) in which mutations were not detected.

gions of exon 1 that code for 4 of the presumed
transmembrane segments of this postulated transmembrane transport protein. Two of these are
within the predicted membrane spanning segment
(Patients 1 and 2) and one (Patient 3 ) is at the
edge of such a segment. These mutations result in
a change of charge and polarity (see Table 2). T h e
transmembrane region has a role in determining
the specificity of a transporter (Higgins, 1992) and
thus changing the charge or polarity of the amino
acid residue could interfere with the specificity of
the transporter. In the CFTR gene, it was found
that many mutations that affect the transmembrane domains and their neighboring sequences involve changes of charge or polarity (Tsui, 1992).
Four mutations were found within the ATP bind-

ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY GENE

ing domain, one in Walker A (G512S), one in
Walker B (R617H), one in the highly conserved
sequence preceding Walker B (S606L), and one in
the middle of the domain. In most instances the
ALDP missense mutations correspond to residues
that are conserved between ALD and human
PMP70 (Gartner et al., 1992). The mutations in
Walker A and B motifs and the conserved sequence affect amino acids that are invariant among
ABC transporters and that are sites of CFTR mutations (Tsui, 1992, Cutting et al., 1990; Kerem et
al. 1990; Ferec et al., 1992). The mutation in
patient no. 23 involves an amino acid residue that
is also highly conserved among ABC proteins. The
remainder of the missense mutations were found in
regions outside of the known conserved functional
domains of this family of proteins. Some caution
must be exercised in the functional interpretation
of these mutations. First, about 64% of the missense mutations can be explained by deamination
of methylcytosine in CpG dinucleotides even
though CpG dinucleotides represent less than 6%
of the nucleotides in the translated portion of the
gene. These mutations are common and account
for about 35% of all single bp substitutions that
cause human genetic disease (Cooper and Youssoufian, 1988). The most frequent amino acid substitution found in this series involves arginine. Because arginine is a charged amino acid, mutations
that result in a charge change at these positions
could affect function and/or conformation. However, five of the six substitutions at arginine residues can be explained by C to T or G to A transitions and may be a reflection of the CpG
mutational hot spot. In addition, many missense
mutations in the ALD gene result in an unstable
protein that is degraded (Watkins, manuscript submitted). Since peroxisome structure is normal in
patients with X-linked ALD, it can be inferred
that ALDP is not required for normal biogenesis or
stability of peroxisomes. However, ALDP is clearly
associated with peroxisomes, appears to be required for normal beta-oxidation of VLCFA and
must contain residues that are important for its
interaction with peroxisomes. Mutations that
weaken the interaction of ALDP with peroxisomes
might result in the degradation of the unbound
protein. Direct functional analysis of potential
missense mutations is required before conclusions
about the association of specific mutations with
function can be drawn.
A small region of six nucleotides within exon 5
is particularly susceptible to small deletions and
insertions. Among the 28 mutations described in

113

this study, nine were frameshift changes in this
region: 1 A insertion, 1 AA deletion and 7 identical AG deletions. The AG deletions occurred in
kindreds with different ethnic and geographical origin and included several different DXS52 markers.
Thus it is likely that these are recurrent mutations
and not the result of a founder effect. Similar results have been reported by Kemp et al. (1994).
The origin of these mutations is not clear. Sequence motifs that are typically associated with
slipped mispairing, hairpin stem and loop formation or misalignment due to direct or inverted repeats (Krawczak and Cooper, 1991) are present in
this region but not in configurations that can easily
account for the observed changes. The region of
instability in exon 5 is preceded by a sequence,
TGGATGTGGAAC, that is similar to a motif
known to predispose to short deletions and insertions (Krawczak and Cooper, 1991) and is flanked
by several repeats and possible palindromic motifs
that could lead to complicated mispairing or structural changes leading to the observed changes.
However, none of the hypothesized structures specifically expose the insertioddeletion region in
any obvious way.
The preponderance of evidence indicates that
variations in the primary molecular defect in the
ALD gene do not explain the striking phenotypic
variability in ALD. We reported earlier that the
co-occurrence of widely varying phenotypes within
the same kindred and nuclear family is common
(Moser e t a]., 1992). Mosser et al. (1993) previously noted that the childhood cerebral and “Addison only” phenotypes occurred in two brothers
who were shown to have the same deletion. In
confirmation of this point, mutations associated
with each of the 3 phenotypic categories included
in this study are distributed throughout the gene.
In addition all 3 phenotypes are found among the
patients with the identical AG deletion.
Of particular interest are the 2 patients in which
we were unable to determine a mutation within
the region of the ALD gene examined. Patient 24
(Figure 7F) lacks detectable ALDP in fibroblasts
and thus presumably has a mutation somewhere in
his ALD gene that accounts for his lack of ALDP
and thus his disease. The most likely explanation is
a mutation leading to a new splice site and a down
stream stop codon in a region of an intron that we
did not examine. The cause of disease in the other
patient (no. 25) is more obscure. He has elevated
plasma levels of VLCFA (Table 2) and abnormal
beta oxidation of VLCFA (data not shown). Yet,
he has a normal distribution of ALDP in his fibro-

114

blasts (Figure 7, panel E) and no discernable mutation within the open reading frame of the ALD
gene. Thus, his biochemical abnormality and disease may not be the result of altered ALDP function. While exon shuffling that retains open reading frames and splice sites but alters the protein
structure or subtle quantitative variation in the
production of ALDP cannot be ruled out at this
time, the possibility of the involvement of a second gene as the primary genetic defect in ALD
needs to be considered.
Finally, confirmation that the ALD gene is defective in the vast majority of ALD patients has
important practical implications. While the demonstration of abnormally elevated VLCFA has
proven to be a reliable assay for the identification
of affected males (Moser et al., 1994), including
male fetuses (Moser et al., 1982), it is not fully
satisfactory for the identification of heterozygotes
because of the risk of false negative results (Moser
et al., 1983). Linkage analysis with the DXS52
probe (ST14) can be used but only if appropriate
family members are available and the probe is informative in the family at risk. In addition, carrier
status cannot be predicted by linkage analysis in
the case of a de novo mutation. The capacity for
intragenic analysis will clearly improve the accuracy of heterozygote identification. When the kindred’s mutation is known this approach would replace the VLCFA assay as the preferred diagnostic
tool in potential carriers of ALD.
