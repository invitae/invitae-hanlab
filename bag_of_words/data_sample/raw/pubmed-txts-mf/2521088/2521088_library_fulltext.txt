This study attempted
lates to the structural
the corpus

callosum

to identify microscopic
abnormalities
reported
of schizophrenic

correin

patients.

Sections
of the genu, body, and splenium
of the
corpus callosum
were taken from formalin-fixed
brains of deceased patients
with schizophrenia
and
nonschizophrenic
control subjects.
Photomicrographs of stained tissue were projected,
and nerve
fibers were counted.
There were no significant
differences (p>O.4) in axonal counts between schizophrenic and control patients for any of the sites
sampled.
Our results suggest
that morphometric
abnormalities
of the corpus callosum
of schizophrenic patients,
if present, are not the consequence
of
a primary
process within this structure.
