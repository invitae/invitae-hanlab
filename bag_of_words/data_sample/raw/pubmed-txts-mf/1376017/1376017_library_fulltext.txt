Summary
To determine the nature and frequency of non-AF508 cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations among diverse populations, we have sequenced exons 9-12 and 19-23 of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
gene from 128 CF chromosomes (39 U.S. Caucasian, 27 African-American, 42 Northern Irish, and 20 Israeli
chromosomes). These regions were chosen because they encode the two putative ATP-binding folds of
CFTR, domains which appear to have functional significance. In addition, CFTR exons 1 and 2 were analyzed
in the American patients. Mutations were found on 49 of the 128 CF chromosomes. Nineteen different
mutations were observed; six were novel, while the remaining 13 had been reported previously by our group
or by other investigators. Six of nine different mutations found in African-American patients were unique
to that population. However, the vast majority of the mutations found in U.S. Caucasians (eight of nine),
Northern Irish (four of five), and Israelis (three of three) also occurred in other Caucasian groups. The
preponderance of previously reported mutations in these three groups suggested that a subset of the non-AF508
mutations occur in common among Caucasians. A survey of mutation frequencies in other Caucasian groups
confirmed this observation. Unfortunately, this subset accounts for less than half of non-AF508 CF mutations
in most groups. These data suggest that screening for AF508 and this select group of mutations will efficiently
and economically maximize the number of CF mutations identified in Caucasian groups. However, it will be
difficult to detect more than 90% of mutant CFTR alleles except in ethnically and geographically discrete
populations where CF is the result of founder effect.
Introduction

Cystic fibrosis (CF), a major cause of chronic pulmonary, sinus, and digestive disease in children and
young adults, is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR) (Riordan et al. 1989). One mutation, a deletion of 3 bp that causes the omission of a phenylalanine
residue at codon 508 (i.e., AF508) accounts for the
majority of mutant CFTR alleles (Kerem et al. 1989).

However, the frequency of this mutation varies widely
among populations, ranging from 30% in Ashkenazi
Jews to 88% in Denmark (Cystic Fibrosis Genetic
Analysis Consortium 1990). More than 150 other mutations of this gene have been reported by members of
the Cystic Fibrosis Genetic Analysis Consortium. A
few of these mutations occur at a frequency of 1 % or
greater and occur in more than one population (Cutting et al. 1990b; Dean et al. 1990; Kerem et al. 1990;
Vidaud et al. 1990; Devoto et al. 1991; Gasparini et
al. 1991; Nunes et al. 1991; Osborne et al. 1991;
Shrimpton et al. 1991; Zielinski et al. 1991a). However, the majority of the remaining mutations have
been reported as single cases (Cutting et al. 1990a;
White et al. 1990, 1991; lannuzzi et al. 1991;
1185

1186

Ivaschenko et al. 1991; Nunes et al. 1991). The everincreasing number of mutations and their varying frequencies among populations suggest that gene diagnosis will not be straightforward in CF.
Highly accurate prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection within families with an affected member has
been possible since 1985, when markers closely linked
to the gene responsible for CF were developed (Tsui
et al. 1985; Beaudet et al. 1986). Direct DNA diagnosis for a majority of these patients and their families
became possible following the identification of the
common mutation (AF508) and several less common
mutations ofthe CFTR gene (Kerem et al. 1989, 1990;
Cutting et al. 1 990b). Gene diagnosis can now be performed for several other reasons: (1) to determine the
relationship between genotype and phenotype, (2) in
cases where the diagnosis of CF is unclear or where it
is not possible to obtain an adequate sweat collection
to determine electrolyte composition, and (3) in
screening of the general population for CF carriers.
The latter appears to be the most controversial application of DNA diagnosis in CF (Beaudet 1990; Brock
1990; Colten 1990; De Braekeleer and Melancon
1990; Gilbert 1990). Concerns have been raised regarding the use of a screening test that cannot detect
all carriers. In the United States, consensus reports
have been issued from The American Society of Human Genetics and a National Institutes of Health advisory panel recommending that population-wide
screening not take place until the screening test can
identify 95% of carriers; and the ethical, financial,
and social impact of screening has been assessed by
carefully designed pilot studies (Caskey et al. 1990;
Workshop on Population Screening for the Cystic Fibrosis Gene 1990).
Preliminary screening studies have already been initiated in countries such as the United Kingdom and
Denmark, where 85%-90% of mutations can be detected (Watson and Williamson 1990; Mennie et al.
1991; Schwartz and Brandt 1991). However, in countries with more heterogeneous populations, such as
the United States, the feasibility of screening programs
depends on more complete information regarding the
distribution of mutations among human populations.
In the present study, patients from four diverse population groups (three Caucasian and one AfricanAmerican) have been analyzed for all mutations present in exons 9-12 and 19-23 of the CFTR gene. These
exons were chosen because they appear to encode
functionally important regions of the CFTR gene (Riordan et al. 1989; Cutting et al. 1990b; Kerem et

Cutting et al.

al. 1990). The predominance of previously reported
mutations in the Caucasian group indicates that a select subset of mutations occur in common among populations. Screening of the four population groups for
select mutations in another region of the CFTR gene,
as well as compilation of screening data from several
other centers, have provided evidence supporting this
hypothesis.
Patients and Methods
Patients

Lymphocyte genomic DNA samples containing 27
unknown (non-AF508) CFTR gene mutations were
obtained from 16 African-American patients and their
families attending The Johns Hopkins Cystic Fibrosis
Clinic; from one family from Children's Hospital National Medical Center, Washington, DC; and from
one patient from the University of Virginia Medical
Center, Charlottesville. Thirty-nine chromosomes
bearing unknown mutations were analyzed from 17
U.S. Caucasian patients attending The Johns Hopkins
Cystic Fibrosis Clinic, and an additional 11 U.S. Caucasian families were referred to The Johns Hopkins
DNA Diagnostic Laboratory for prenatal diagnosis.
DNA samples from nine Israeli patients (seven Ashkenazi, one Druze, and one Arab) and from two parents (both Sephardic) comprising 20 unknown CF mutations were obtained from Hadassah University,
Jerusalem. Forty-two unknown mutations were analyzed from Belfast City Hospital in Northern Ireland.
All patients had symptoms diagnostic of CF and had
sweat chloride levels greater than 60 mEq/liter.
PCR Amplification and DNA Sequencing
Single exons of CFTR were amplified from 5001,000 ng of genomic DNA by using primers selected
from intron sequence flanking CFTR exons 1, 2, 9-12,
and 19-23. Primers lbpF (5'-AAGCCAGCTAGA-

GCAAATTT-3') and hR (5'-CGAAGCCTTTCTGTCACGGGT-3') were used to amplify exon 1, and
primers 2bpF (5'-CATAATTTTCCATATGCCAG-3')
and 2bpR (5'-GTGGTATGAACCGAGGAATAA-3')
were used to amplify exon 2 (all four primers were
provided by Carol Wicking, St. Mary's Hospital, London). Primers for PCR amplification of exons 9-12
and 19-23 have been described elsewhere (Zielinski
et al. 1991 b), but primer 22i-3 (5'-CACCATGAAGCAGGCATAA-3') was slightly modified. Conditions
used for PCR amplification were as described else-

Common Caucasian CF Mutations

where (Cutting et al. 1990a), with the exception that
the annealing step was performed at 540C for the exons 1 and 2 primers, at 550C for the exon 10 primers,
and at 600C for the exons 12 and 19 primers. Direct
DNA sequencing of one-tenth of the amplified DNA
was performed using sequencing primers shown in table 1 (Cutting et al. 1990b). Each exon was sequenced
in the 5'-to-3' direction, except for exon 9, which has
a polymorphic CA repeat in the intron immediately
preceding the 5' splice site (Zielinski et al. 1991b).
Complete analysis of exons 1, 9, 10, 19, 20, and 22
was achieved by sequencing in the 3'-to-5' direction
by using primers in the 3' flanking intron sequence of
each exon and with a primer within the sequence of
exon 9.
Detection of Exons 4 and 7 Mutations

Patients with one or more unknown mutations were
screened for mutations R117H and 621 + 1G--T in
exon 4, by using allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO)
hybridization, and mutations R334W and R347P in
exon 7, by using restriction-enzyme digestion (Dean
et al. 1990; Gasparini et al. 1991; Shrimpton et al.
1991). Genomic DNA was amplified with primers specific for exon 4 (4i-5' and 4i-3') or exon 7 (7i-5' and
7i-3') (Zielinski et al. 1991b). One-tenth of the PCRamplified DNA was alkaline denatured in 100 gl of
0.4 N NaOH and 25 mM Na2EDTA and then was
vacuum blotted and linked to a Zetabind membrane
(CUNO, Meriden, CT). Mutations R117H and

CF48 (5'-GAGGAACACTCTATC-3') (Dean et al.
1990) and 337J (5'-GGAAGTATTAACTTCTTATA-3'), respectively. 338J, an oligonucleotide which
detects normal sequence (5'-GATAGAGCGTTCCTC-3'), was used to confirm the presence of DNA
amplified from exon 4. Oligonucleotide probes (100
ng each) were end-labeled for 30 min at 370C by using
5 units of T4 kinase (BRL) and 150 ICi of [y32p] ATP in
a reaction mixture recommended by the manufacturer
(BRL). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by
centrifugation at 1,300 g for 5 min in Select D spin
columns (5 prime3 prime, Inc.) with 1 ml of Biogel
P4 (Biorad). Hybridization of the filter was performed
for 1 h at 370C by using 15 x 106 cpm of oligonucleotide probe in approximately 5 ml of 5 x SSPE (0.9 M
NaCl, 5 mM NaH2 P04, 5 mM NaEDTA pH. 7.4),
0.5% SDS, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone,
and 0.1% Ficoll. Filters were washed once in 2 x
SSPE, 0.1% SDS, at 490C for CF48 and 338J and at
51 0C for 337J and then were autoradiographed at
- 800C for 2 h. Mutations R334W and R347P were
detected by using restriction digestion with enzymes
MspI and HhaI, respectively, as reported elsewhere
(Gasparini et al. 1991; Shrimpton et al. 1991). Genomic DNA carrying each mutation was used to control
for ASO specificity and enzyme digestion.
Results

DNA sequencing of exons 9-12 and 19-23 from
CFTR genes of all four groups of patients and from
exons 1 and 2 of the U.S. Caucasian and AfricanAmerican groups revealed 19 mutations, 6 of which
are novel. The novel mutations and sequence polymorphisms discovered in the present study are summarized in table 2. Each novel mutation was observed on
one CF chromosome only and was observed in one
parent not carrying a previously identified CF mutation in each case, except for the intron 8 mutation (see
below). The mutations C247-1T and G4243-,T produce
termination signals in exon 2 (Q39X) and exon 22
(E1371X), respectively. The latter mutation creates a
novel MseI site. Both mutations were discovered in
genes from U.S. Caucasian patients. The first patient
had a missense mutation, tyrosine to asparagine at
codon 563, on the other chromosome (Kerem et al.
1990). The patient had severe lung disease and pancreatic insufficiency and died at 20 years of age of pulmonary complications. The second nonsense mutation
was found in a 35-year-old patient carrying the AF508

mutation on the other chromosome. This patient has
severe pulmonary disease and pancreatic insufficiency.
One frameshift mutation, the deletion of an adenine
nucleotide at position 3662, was discovered on one
CF chromosome from an African-American patient.
This mutation is predicted to cause a shift in the reading frame, leading to a premature termination signal
14 codons downstream. The mutation on this patient's other CF chromosome is unknown. The patient
is 11 years old and has moderate lung disease and

pancreatic insufficiency.
Two alterations were discovered in regions crucial
to RNA splicing. One CFTR gene from an AfricanAmerican patient had an AG-'PAC mutation of the 3'
splice site of intron 8 and is abbreviated as "1342-1
G--C." The guanine nucleotide is almost invariant
at this position in splice acceptor sites (Shapiro and
Senapathy 1987). Mutations of this nucleotide have
been associated with aberrant splicing in various other
genes (Kazazian 1990; Satokata et al. 1990; Su and
Lin 1990; Mules et al. 1991). This mutation is paired
with AF508 in a patient with moderately severe lung
disease and pancreatic insufficiency. We presume that
this patient inherited this mutation from his father,
since his mother does not carry this mutation. The
second putative splice mutation was found on a single
chromosome from a Northern Irish patient and occurs
at the last nucleotide of exon 19 (G3849-oA). The mutation does not alter the encoded amino acid, but the
location of the mutation suggests that it may be associated with abnormal splicing (Hodges and Rosenberg

1989; Vidaud et al. 1989; Jones et al. 1992). This
mutation occurs with AF508 in a patient with moderate to severe pulmonary disease and pancreatic in-

sufficiency.
A nucleotide substitution of A for G at position
3739 in exon 19, causing the amino acid substitution
of isoleucine for valine at codon 1203 (I1203V), was
found in one African-American patient. This change
was not discovered on 33 normal African-American
chromosomes carrying at least two polymorphic sites
(XV2C, KM19, D9, or G2) in common with the haplotype of the chromosome bearing this mutation, suggesting that it may be a disease-producing mutation.
However, this alteration does not occur in a highly
conserved region of the gene and is a relatively conservative amino acid substitution. Most important, this
change was identified on a chromosome carrying a
nonsense mutation in exon 20 (S1255X) (Cutting et
al. 1990a). Therefore, it is unclear whether I1203V is
associated with disease or is merely an accumulated
mutation in a nonfunctioning gene. This alteration
can be detected by AatI digestion of exon 1 9-amplified

DNA.
The distribution of all the mutations discovered in
the present study is arranged by population group
in table 3. One mutation, G542X, was observed in
all four groups. Two other mutations (S549N and
R553X) in African-Americans have been reported to
occur in Caucasian CF patients, although R553X is
probably a recurrent mutation (Reiss et al. 1991). The
remaining six mutations discovered in African-Ameri-

cans appear to be unique. However, eight of the nine
mutations in North American Caucasian patients,
four of the five mutations in Northern Irish patients,
and all of the mutations observed in Israeli patients
have been reported to occur in other patients of Caucasian background (Cystic Fibrosis Genetic Analysis
Consortium 1990).
The mutation GSS1D was found on several CF
chromosomes from U.S. Caucasian and Northern
Irish patients but not on any CF chromosomes from
African-Americans or Israelis. Another exon 11 mutation, R560T, originally reported on a single chromosome (Kerem et al. 1990) was found five times in the
Northern Irish. Further screening reveals that this mutation accounts for 3.3% (12/362) of CF chromosomes in this population. The missense mutation
N1303K was found on one chromosome from each of
the three Caucasian populations. Finally, the nonsense
mutation W1282X was discovered on 8 of 20 chromosomes from the Israeli group. Further analysis revealed
that all of the patients bearing this mutation were of
Ashkenazi origin (Abeliovich et al. 1991). Screening
of the Ashkenazi population in Israel demonstrated
that W1282X is the most common CF mutation, accounting for almost 50% of mutations (Lerer et al.
1992). This has been independently observed by
Kerem and colleagues (Shoshani et al. 1992).
The discovery of relatively few novel mutations in
the Caucasian group, as well as the preponderance of
previously reported mutations, suggested that a select
subset of the more than 150 mutations reported to the
Cystic Fibrosis Genetic Analysis Consortium might be
found in the majority of Caucasian populations. Four
mutations, R117H (Dean et al. 1990) and 621 + 1
G-'T (Zielinski et al. 1991a) in exon 4 and R334W
(Gasparini et al. 1991) and R347P (Dean et al. 1990)
in exon 7, occur with some frequency in these populations. Patients whose mutations were still unknown
after sequencing of exons 1,2,9-12, and 19-23 were
then screened for these mutations. Three CF chromosomes from three U.S. Caucasians and from two
Northern Irish patients were found to carry the
621 + 1G--T mutation, and one chromosome from a
Northern Irish patient carried the R117H mutation.
Discussion
DNA sequencing is the most sensitive method for
detecting novel mutations. By this technique, exons
9-12 and 19-23, encompassing approximately 26%
of the coding region of the CFTR gene, have been

Cutting et al.

analyzed from 39 U.S. Caucasian, 27 African-American, 42 Northern Irish, and 20 Israeli non-AFS08 CF
chromosomes. An additional 6% of CFTR exon sequences (exons 1 and 2) were examined in the American groups. Six novel and 13 previously reported mutations accounted for 49 (38%) of 128 mutant CFTR
alleles. The distribution of these mutations clearly
differed between the African-American patients and
the three groups of Caucasian origin. Two-thirds of
the mutations discovered in African-Americans appear to be unique to that population. This confirms
the hypothesis, first suggested by DNA polymorphism
analysis, that racial admixture alone does not account
for the occurrence of CF in African-Americans (Cutting et al. 1989). It also confirms that CF mutations
exist in non-Caucasian populations despite the rarity
of the disorder in these groups.
The similarity in estimates of the frequency of nonAFS08 CF mutations among Caucasian, AfricanAmerican, and Asian populations suggests that the
high incidence of CF in Caucasians is probably due,
for the most part, to the high frequency of the AF508
mutation in that population (Cutting 1990). Why this
particular allele is so common is unclear: perhaps it
confers an advantage to the Caucasian heterozygote.
However, any explanation should take into account
both the high frequency of the null allele G542X in
almost all populations studied and the predominance
of the nonsense mutation W1282X in Ashkenazi pa-

tients.
The discovery of a rare missense mutation (I1 203V)
on a CF chromosome bearing a nonsense mutation
reveals a further complication of mutation analysis.
Genes that are inactivated by deleterious mutations
can accumulate additional random alterations that
may result in a change in the encoded amino acid (Kazazian et al. 1984; Clark et al. 1985). This type of
alteration could be incorrectly interpreted as the
disease-producing mutation, especially since it is unlikely that this change will be found in normal genes.
Missense mutations which appear to be unique should
therefore be interpreted carefully until the function of
the mutant protein has been determined.
The composition of mutations found in the U.S.
Caucasian group (table 3) is not unexpected and reflects the European origin of this group. However, it
is notable that analysis of 11 CFTR exons from 39
genes with unknown mutations revealed only one
novel mutation in this group. A similar, although
more striking, finding occurred during the analysis
of the Northern Irish and Israeli patients. Previously

reported mutations accounted for almost all of the
mutations in these patients. One mutation (W1282X)
was found in high frequency in Ashkenazi Israelis,
probably reflecting founder effect. This phenomenon
also appears to account for the high frequency of mutations 621 + 1G-*T and A455E observed in FrenchCanadian families from the Saguenay-Lac St. Jean region of Quebec (Rozen et al. 1992). Genetic drift is an
alternative explanation for the higher frequencies of
certain mutations in particular groups. The frequent
observation of the R560T mutation in Northern Irish
may be an example of drift. These ethnic variations
are not unexpected, as experience with a number of
other autosomal recessive disorders (e.g., 13-thalassemia, ornithine aminotransferase deficiency, and TaySachs disease) has shown the same pattern.
Discovery of the common CF mutation, AF508,
enabled direct DNA diagnosis by a variety of methods
(Kerem et al. 1989; Rommens et al. 1990). The interpopulation variation in the frequency ofthis mutation,
however, substantially alters the number of mutant
CFTR alleles that can be detected by direct methods.
The large number of CFTR gene mutations being reported to the Cystic Fibrosis Genetic Analysis Consortium appeared to indicate that it would not be a simple
task to increase the proportion of detectable mutations. In table 4, the frequency of 20 CF mutations
in the four population groups in the present study is
compared with the results of screening 12 Caucasian
groups. In addition to AF508, 14 mutations in exons
10, 11, 4, 20, and 21 (group 1) were found to occur
with some frequency in the majority of Caucasian
groups. This supports the notion that a subset of the
more than 150 mutations reported to the Cystic Fibrosis Genetic Analysis Consortium occurs in common
among Caucasian populations.
Screening for AF508 and this subset of mutations
should be an efficient and economical method to maximize the number of CF mutations identified in most
population groups. In northern European countries,
screening for these mutations should detect nearly
90% of CF mutations (table 4). Northern Ireland appears to be an exception, the cause of which is presently under investigation. Screening of southern European populations for these mutations will identify
about 60% of CF mutations (Nunes et al. 1991). The
lower detection rate is due to the lower frequency (approximately 50%) of the AF508 mutation in southern
Europeans. Mutation detection in North American
Caucasian populations should average in the 80%-

85% range, reflecting a mixture of northern and
southern European ancestry.
There is some evidence that mutation detection
rates might be further increased in certain populations. As shown in table 4, screening for a second subset of mutations (group 2) which are in high frequency
in some populations (e.g., R11 62X in southern EuroG-+ T in French-Canadians in Quepeans and 711+1
bec) can increase the detection level substantially for
those populations. For most Caucasian groups, however, screening for mutations in the first subset (group
1) appears to be most economical. The mutations are
grouped by exon so that DNA diagnostic laboratories
can tailor the number of exons analyzed, to maximize
detection rates for their particular population. Certain
technical steps can also be taken to simplify a multiple-mutation screen. For example, the four mutations occurring at codon 549 are relatively infrequent
but together constitute a substantial fraction of mutations. Three of these mutations (S5491, N, and R
[A-*C]) destroy a DdeI site and can easily be detected
by restriction analysis (Cutting et al. 1990b).
In conclusion, direct mutation analysis will be most
effective in ethnically discrete populations where CF
is probably the result of founder effect. For example,
screening for four mutations in the Ashkenazi Jewish
and for five mutations in French-Canadians of the
Saguenay-Lac St. Jean region detects more than 90%
of mutations. A number of techniques that can detect
rapidly many mutant alleles are now - or soon will
be-available (Barany 1991; Erlich et al. 1991; Friedman et al. 1991). Combining this technology with the
growing knowledge of the ethnic distribution of CFTR
gene mutations should provide a DNA diagnostic test
that is very specific (more than 99%) and relatively
sensitive (80%-90%) for most North American and
northern European Caucasian populations. However,
the large number of rare mutations will preclude the
use of a simple screening tool to detect more than 90%
of mutations in the majority of Caucasian populations.
