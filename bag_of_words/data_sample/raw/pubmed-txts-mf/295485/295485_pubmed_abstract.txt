In 18 patients with congenital choanal atresia the connection between impeded nasal respiration and dentofacial development was studied by a combined radiocephalometric and biometric method. The results obtained showed that neither the dental occlusion nor the vertical facial growth diverged from normal. The sagittal growth, however, was significantly reduced. Consequently, nasal stenosis remaining during the growth period contributes not only to transitory discomfort but seems to induce permanent morphologic alterations as well.
