von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is an inherited neoplastic disease characterized by a predisposition
to develop retinal angiomas, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinomas, pancreatic cysts, and pheochromocytomas. The VHL gene was recently isolated by positional cloning. The
cDNA encodes 852 nucleotides in 3 exons. The VHL gene is unrelated to any known gene families.
We identified germline mutations in 851114 (75%) of VHL families. Clinical heterogeneity is a
well-known feature of VHL. VHL families were classified into 2 types based on the presence or
absence of pheochromocytoma. The types of mutations responsible for VHL without pheochtomocytoma (VHL type 1) differed from those responsible for VHL with pheochromocytoma (VHL type 2).
Fifty-six % of the mutations responsible for VHL type 1 were microdeletionsiinsertions, nonsense
mutations, or deletions: 96Yo of the mutations responsible for VHL type 2 were missense mutations.
Specific mutations in codon 238 accounted for 43% of the mutations responsible for VHL type 2. The
mutations identified in these families will be useful in presymptomatic diagnosis. The identification of
mutations associated with phenotypes contributes to the understanding of fundamental genetic mechanisms of VHL disease. C) 1995 WiIey-Liss, 1nc.f

INTRODUCTION
Hippel-Lindau
(VHL) disease (MM
#19330) is an inherited neoplastic disorder characterized by a predisposition to develop tumors in
the eyes, central nervous system (CNS), kidneys,
adrenal glands, and pancreas (Melmon and Rosen,
1964). Clinical heterogeneity is a well-known feature of VHL disease (Lamiell et a]., 1989; Glenn et
al., 1990, 1991; Neumann and Wiestler, 1991).
While affected members of all VHL families are
predisposed to develop retinal angiomas and CNS
hemangioblastomas, families vary in predisposition
to develop pheochromocytomas, pancreatic cysts,

and renal cell carcinomas. Differences in predisposition to tumors have been most carefully documented for pheochromocytoma, which occur in
about 20% of VHL families (Lamiell et al., 1989;
Glenn et al., 1990).
There is no satisfactory explanation for the clinical heterogeneity observed in VHL. While the
VHL gene is known to be a tumor suppressor gene,

it is difficult to envision a null allele producing
different neoplastic phenotypes. Allelic heterogeneity or a contiguous gene syndrome have been
proposed as the basis for the observed clinical heterogeneity (Glenn e t al., 1991; Neumann and
Wiestler, 1991).
The VHL gene was recently isolated by positional cloning (Latif et al., 1993). The gene was
localized to chromosome 3 ~ 2 5 - 2 6by linkage analysis (Seizinger et al., 1988; Hosoe et al., 1990); 3
nested germline deletions (100-380 kb), detected
by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, provided a molecular access to the gene (Yao et al., 1993). The
partial 1.64-kilobase (kb) cDNA detected transcripts of 6 and 6.5 kb. The cDNA encodes 852
nucleotides in 3 exons. The predicted protein contains an acidic pentameric repeat that has homology to an acidic repeat domain in the procyclic surface membrane protein of Trypanaosoma brucei. The
VHL gene has the characteristics of a classic tumor
suppressor gene: loss of the wild-type allele has
been demonstrated in renal cell carcinomas from
VHL patients (Gnarra et al., 1994), and mutations
of the gene have been found in sporadic renal cell
carcinomas, together with a loss of heterozygosity
(Latif et al., 1993; Gnarra et al., 1994).
The purpose of this work was to define the spectrum of mutations in the germline of a large number
of unrelated patients with VHL and to correlate the
VHL mutations with phenotype. Previously, we
found that 12% of unrelated patients had large
(4-15-kb) deletions in the VHL gene (Latif et al.,
1993). In this study we examined 852 nucleotides
of the coding region for mutations by SSCP and
DNA sequencing. The mutations identified will
facilitate the presymptomatic diagnosis of VHL.
The type of mutation found in patients with pheochromocytomas suggest possible mechanisms of tumorigenes is.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical

We tested samples from affected members of 114
apparently unrelated VHL families for mutations.
The panel consisted of one affected individual from
VHL families 1-41 (Hosoe et al., 1990; Glenn et
al., 1992) and of 73 additional families identified
during a nationwide search for VHL families. Families came from the United States, Canada, Puerto
Rico, and Hawaii. The diagnostic criteria for VHL
have been described (Hosoe et al., 1990). Families
predisposed to VHL without a member affected
with pheochromocytoma were classified as VHL
type 1; families predisposed to develop VHL with at

67

least one member affected with pheochromocytoma
were classified as VHL type 2. Medical records from
affected individuals were reviewed at the National
Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health
(NIH). Members of 56/114 VHL families studied in
this report were examined (after informed consent)
at the Clinical Center of the NIH (Bethesda, MD).
A panel of 96 normal individuals (parents of CEPH
families) were used to test for polymorphisms in the
VHL gene.
Polymerase Chain Reactions

Genomics DNAs were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) under the following
conditions: 50-100 ng of template DNA, 1 x
PCR buffer (Boehringer Mannheim), 10 pmoles of
each PCR primer, 200 pM each of dGTP, dATP,
dTTP, and dCTP, and 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) in 1 vol of 10 pl,
with an initial 3-min denaturation at 95"C, followed by 35 step cycles of 95"C/Imin, 58"C/1 min,
and 72"C/2 min, and final extension 72"C/5 min,
in a PCR 9600 Perkin Elmer Cetus machine.
SSCP Analysis

Single-strand

conformation

polymorphism

(SSCP) analysis was performed as previously described (Orita et al., 1989; Glavac and Dean,
1993). A 10-pl aliquot of each PCR reaction, prepared as described above, containing 1 pCi
[ C X ~ ~ S I ~was
A Tadded
P to 5 pl of stop-solution (10
mM NaOH, 95% formamide, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromophenol blue), heated to 95°C for
5 min, and chilled on ice. The entire mixture was
then loaded onto nondenaturing hydrolink gels (0.5
X MDE, 0.6 X TBE, 10% glycerol) (AT Biochemicals, Malvern, PA). The gels were run at 5 W
overnight at room temperature, dried on Whatman
3MM paper and exposed to X-ray film overnight.
The following primers for SSCP were used:

Sequencing of PCR Products

SSCP-positive samples were amplified by PCR
with one primer biotinylated (Hultman et al.,
1989) at the 5‘ end in a total volume of 50 pl.
Biotinylated products were combined with streptavidin-conjugated Dynabeads (Dynal AS, Oslo,
Norway), followed by alkali denaturation to retain
biotinylated single strand products. These templates were subjected to dideoxy sequencing reactions using [ C X ~ ~ S I ~label
A T Pand Sequenase version 2.0 (U.S. Biochemicals). The reaction
products were separated o n 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (National Diagnostics, Atlanta,
GA). Sequencing of both strands of genomic DNA
was performed to confirm a mutation. In some
cases, PCR products were subcloned using the TA
cloning kit (Invitrogen) or pCR-Script (Stratagene) and sequenced to confirm complicated mutations. Several different primers were used to
identify mutations in exon 1; the sequence of these
primers is available from the authors on request.
Haplotype Analysis

Haplotypes were determined with four microsatellite polymorphic probes, D3S1038, D3S13 17,
D3S1350, and D3S1335 and the nucleotide 19
polymorphism within the VHL disease gene. The
frequencies of heterozygotes were D3S1038: 0.79;
D3S1317: 0.68; D3S1350: 0.70; D3S1335: 0.64,
and the nucleotide 19 VHL polymorphism: 0.45.

RESULTS
Germline Mutations in the VHL Gene

We identified germline mutations in the VHL
gene in 8 9 1 14 (75%) of the families in our panel.
Sixty-seven mutations in the VHL gene detected
by SSCP and DNA sequencing are described in
Table 1; 18 germline deletions (4-380 kb) in the
VHL gene detected by Southern blotting or
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were described previously (Yao et al., 1993; Latif et al., 1993). We
identified 49 missense, 6 nonsense, and 12 microdeletion/insertion mutations in the VHL gene

(Table 1, Figs. 1, 2). All mutations were located
between nucleotides 376 and 776, a region of 400
nucleotides (Fig. 1). Mutations in the VHL gene
were found in each of the 3 coding exons; mutations clustered at the 3’ end of exon 1 and the 5’
end of exon 3. No mutations were detected in the
acidic pentameric repeat element located in exon
1. 41/67 mutations that we detected were unique
to individual VHL families; 26/67 mutations were
detected in 2 or more VHL families. T h e most
common mutation, detected in 12 families, occurred at a CpG site at nucleotides 712 and 713
(codon 238). The other mutations detected in 2 or
more families were located at nucleotide 746 (4
families) and nucleotides 439, 470, 505, 549, and
686 (2 families). All missense mutations were predicted t o replace the existing amino acid with an
amino acid from a different class. VHL mutations
were detected in affected family members, but not
in unaffected family members or 96 normal individuals.
The frequency of mutations in codon 238 in our
VHL family panel raised the possibility that families with these mutations had a common ancestor.
Haplotype analysis with 5 polymorphic markers located within 300 kb of the VHL gene indicated
that 718 codon 238 mutations were of independent
origin. We identified 7 haplotypes on 8 independent disease chromosomes (data not shown). Additional evidence in support of the independent
origin of these mutations was the fact that families
with the codon 238 mutations were of English,
French Canadian, German, Portuguese, and Spanish ancestry. Haplotype analysis of other VHL families with identical mutations is in progress.
We detected two polymorphisms in the VHL
gene at the 5‘ end of exon 1. A t nucleotide 19, an
A to G change was observed with a frequency of
heterozygotes of 45%. At nucleotide 287, a C to T
change was observed with a frequency of heterozygotes of 2%. In 66/67 VHL families, we identified
a single sequence change in the VHL gene. Affected members of family 2,693 had a 3 nucleotide
deletion at nucleotide 439 as well as a C to A
transversion at nucleotide 234. Although not yet
identified in normal individuals, the change from
C to A at nucleotide 234 may represent a polymorphism.
The deletion mutations, previously identified
(Latif et al., 1993), were drawn o n the cDNA map
to illustrate the affected portions of the gene (Fig.
1). Some mutations deleted parts of the 3’ untranslated region and did not appear to involve coding
sequences.

Southern blot analyses (Latif et al., 1993).

Correlations Between Genotypes
and Phenotypes
The major phenotypic difference between VHL
families is the presence or absence of pheochromocytomas (Lamiell et al., 1989; Glenn et al., 1990).
Accordingly, VHL families in our panel were classified into 2 types based o n the presence of pheochromocytoma. 8811 14 (77%) of families were
VHL without pheochromocytoma (type 1); 26/114
(23%) of familes were VHL with pheochromocytoma (type 2). The disease manifestations for affected members of the 85 VHL families whose mutations have been identified are presented in Table
2 and summarized in Table 3.
The types of mutations responsible for VHL
type 1 differed from those responsible for VHL type
2 (Tables 2, 3). Nearly all families (35/36) with
microdeletions/insertions, nonsense or deletion
(4-380 kb) were identified in VHL type 1; 56% of
the mutations responsible for VHL type 1 were
mutations of these types.
Microdeletions/insertions (P = 0.015) and deletion mutations (P = 0.004) were significantly
correlated with VHL type 1 (Table 3). Virtually all
(22/23) of the mutations identified for VHL type 2
were missense point mutations. Mutations in
codon 238 accounted for 10/23 (43%) of mutations
identified for VHL type 2. Mutations in codon 238
were strongly predictive of a predisposition to
pheochromocytoma. 10/12 families with mutations

at codon 238 had VHL type 2 compared to 13/73
families without mutations at codon 238 (P =
0.00002) (Table 4). The mutations at nucleotides
712 (C to T) and 713 (G to A) inactivated an
MspI restriction endonuclease site permitting ready
detection of these mutations (Fig. 3).
To test the relationship between pheochromocytomas and missense mutations in the VHL gene
further, the database was analyzed according to the
number of affected individuals with each type of
VHL mutation at risk of developing pheochromocytomas (Table 5). There were 312 VHL affected
individuals with missense mutations; 9113 12
(29%) of these individuals developed pheochromocytoma. There were 210 VHL affected individuals with nonsense, microdeleticmiinsertion, or deletion mutations; only one out of 210 (0.5%) of
these individuals developed a pheochromocytoma.
This individual (family 3,103) had a deletion of
the 3’ untranslated region that did not involve the
coding region of the gene. Totally there were 92
patients who developed pheochromocytomas;
91/92 (99%) individuals had missense mutations in
the VHL gene.
There were 4 mutations found in both types of
VHL families. Missense mutations at nucleotides
686, 7 12, 7 13 and 746 were found in VHL types 1
and 2.
We also correlated phenotype with specific nucleotide changes. Two mutations, 505 T to C and

712 C to T, observed in large (more than 40 affected), multigenerational families were associated
with distinct manifestations of VHL. The 505 T to
C mutation was associated with a high frequency of
pheochromocytomas, but no renal cell carcinomas
(family 3127) (Glenn et al., 1991). The 712 C to
T mutation was associated with a high frequency of
both pheochromocytomas and renal cell carcinomas (family 4405) (Green et al., 1986).

DISCUSSION
We examined a large panel of VHL families to
determine the nature and distribution of mutations
responsible for VHL disease. We identified mutations in 85/114 (75%) of VHL families. Mutations
in the VHL gene were found in each of the 3 coding
exons; mutations clustered in the 3‘ end of exon 1
and the 5’ end of exon 3; a few mutations were
detected in exon 2. The region in which point
mutations were detected corresponded to the region
of the VHL gene most highly conserved between
the human gene and its mouse homolog (Latif, F.
et al., unpublished data). Mutations detected by
Southern blotting deleted different portions of the
VHL gene; some mutations deleted parts of the 3’

untranslated region and did not appear to involve
coding sequences. Disruption of VHL gene function
was produced by many types of mutations and by
mutations located over a large area of coding sequence. Precise control of amino acid sequence in
this region of the protein appears to be critical for
maintenance of normal gene function.
One important question is the location of the
25% of the VHL germline mutations we have not
yet identified. Because we have not found the 5’
end of the gene it is possible that there are additional upstream exons that contain mutations. The
VHL promoter and 3’ untranslated regions may
also harbor mutations. Since large deletions confined to the 3’ untranslated region led to VHL it is
clear that this region is important for VHL protein
function; the long 3’ untranslated region may contribute to message localization and stability. Small
intragenic mutations in the 3‘ untranslated region
may lead to VHL. The possibility that there are
mutations located within exons 1-3 not detected
by SSCP appears unlikely because we found SSCP
to be a sensitive method for detecting VHL mutations (Gnarra et al., 1994).
In addition to defining the nature and distribu.

”Each type of mutation was tested by Fisher’s exact test (2-tailed) for association with VHL types 1 or 2. Microdeletionslinsertions (P =
0.015) and deletion mutations (P = 0.004) were predictive of VHL type 1. Missense mutations were significantly more common in VHL
type 2 (P = 0.00001).Nonsense mutations were not significantly associated with VHL type 1 (P = 0.18).

tion of mutations associated with VHL, we have
begun to correlate both the types of mutations and
the specific mutations with VHL phenotypes.
There appeared to be a major difference in the types
of VHL mutations in families with affected members with pheochromocytomas (VHL type 2) compared to families without members with pheochromocytomas (VHL type 1). This difference was
observed either by comparing the frequencies of
different types of mutations in families with and
without pheochromocytoma (Table 3) or by estimating the frequencies of individuals with particular types of VHL mutations developing pheochromocytomas (Table 5). 91/92 (99%) individuals
with VHL in our panel who developed pheochro-

mocytomas had missense mutations; 22/23 (96%) of
the families with pheochromocytomas had missense
mutations. The only individual in our panel with
pheochromocytomas without a missense mutation
was a member of family 3103; Only one out of
twenty affected members of this family had a
pheochromocytoma. This family has a length mutation deleting part of the 3’ untranslated region but
not involving the coding region.
In terms of correlations between specific VHL
mutations and phenotype, we found a mutation
hot spot located at a CpG site in codon 238 that
accounted for 43% of the mutations in families
with VHL associated with pheochromocytomas.
The presence of the codon 238 mutation strongly

correlated with a predisposition to pheochromocytoma. 1 0 0 2 families with the codon 238 mutation
had members with pheochromocytomas; two families (3,699 and 3,739) with codon 238 mutations
did not develop pheochromocytomas, but both
contained only single affected individuals.
In trying to establish correlations between specific mutations and phenotype it is helpful to examine large multigenerational families. One large
multigenerational family (4,405) with a codon 238
mutation (712 C to T) had members affected with
angiomas, hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinomas and pheochromocytomas. A second large
multigenerational family (3,127) had a 505 T to C
mutation had frequent pheochromocytomas but no
family member affected with renal cell carcinoma;
a second small family (3,476) with the identical
505 T to C mutation also had frequent pheochromocytomas without renal cell carcinomas. Although these few families may not be enough to
identify correlation between specific mutation and

phenotype, they will provide a foundation for comparisons with studies by other investigators.
The majority of mutations divided according to
clinical lines (36 mutations were found in VHL type
1 but not type 2; 9 mutations were found in VHL
type 2, but not type 1). However, there were 4
mutations (nucleotides 686, 712, 713, and 746)
where families with the given mutations were found
in both VHL types 1 and 2. The examples of mutations at nucleotides 712 and 713 were discussed
above. The overlap in the classifications of families
with the 686 and 746 mutations (4,408 and 4,485;
3,786, 3,314, 4,419 and 4,403, respectively) depend o n single individuals with pheochromocytomas present in one family but not present in the
other families with the identical mutation. Further
work is clearly necessary with larger number of families as well as continued observation in the existing
families to refine the genotype-phenotype observations described in this report.
The data presented indicated that VHL families

VHL GERMLINE MUTATIONS

with pheochromocytomas were caused by missense
mutations in the VHL gene, and that VHL families with microdeletions/insertions,nonsense, and
deletion mutations did not develop pheochromocytomas. The fact that the manifestations of VHL
are age-dependent and that the number of affected
individuals in our families varied raises the possibility that with continued observation some individuals without pheochromocytomas would subsequently develop these tumors. However our
present observation still predicts the relationship
between a particular type of VHL mutation and
pheochromocytoma.
The major implication of the observation of the
tight association between families with pheochromocytomas and VHL missense mutations is that
the data suggest that the VHL mutant protein must
be full length and retain some degree of function to
produce pheochromocytomas. Mutations predicted
to truncate the VHL protein, or to produce deletions of 1-3 amino acids do not produce pheochromocytomas in VHL disease. Deletion mutations
confined to the 3’ untranslated region of the VHL
gene that would be predicted to compromise the
stability of the VHL message (Jackson, 1993) only
rarely lead to pheochromocytomas.
The mutations that we have identified in 85
VHL familes should greatly facilitate the presymptomatic diagnosis of this disease. The length mutations previously described can be detected simply
by Southern blotting; many of the mutations described in this report change a restriction endonuclease cleavage site and can be readily used to detect
mutations. The genotype-phenotype database provided in Tables 2 and 3 provide a starting point for
an effort to catalog the mutations in VHL and
compare the mutations with disease manifestations.
