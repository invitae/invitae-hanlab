Abstract
Glycogen storage disease (GSD) type 1, which is caused by
the deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), is an autosomal recessive disease with heterogenous symptoms. Two
models of G6Pase catalysis have been proposed to explain
the observed heterogeneities. The translocase-catalytic unit
model proposes that five GSD type 1 subgroups exist which
correspond to defects in the G6Pase catalytic unit (la), a
stabilizing protein (laSP), the glucose-6-P (lb), phosphate/
pyrophosphate (ic), and glucose (id) translocases. Conversely, the conformation-substrate-transport model suggests that G6Pase is a single multifunctional membrane
channel protein possessing both catalytic and substrate (or
product) transport activities. We have recently demonstrated that mutations in the G6Pase catalytic unit cause
GSD type la. To elucidate whether mutations in the G6Pase
gene are responsible for other GSD type 1 subgroups, we
characterized the G6Pase gene of GSD type lb, ic, and laSP
patients. Our results show that the G6Pase gene of GSD type
lb and lc patients is normal, consistent with the translocasecatalytic unit model of G6Pase catalysis. However, a mutation in exon 2 that converts an Arg at codon 83 to a Cys
(R83C) was identified in both G6Pase alleles of the type
laSP patient. The R83C mutation was also demonstrated in
one homozygous and five heterogenous GSD type la patients, indicating that type laSP is a misclassification of GSD
type la. We have also analyzed the G6Pase gene of seven
additional type la patients and uncovered two new mutations that cause GSD type la. (J. Clin. Invest 1995. 95:234240.) Key words: type 1 glycogen storage disease * glucose-6phosphatase genetic mutation * models of G6Pase catalysis

blood glucose concentrations (1-4). It is an autosomal recessive
disorder with an incidence of - 1 in 100,000. The disease presents with clinical manifestations of severe hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, growth retardation, lactic acidemia, hyperlipidemia,
and hyperuricemia (1, 2). GSD type 1 has been classified into
five subgroups, la, 1aSP, lb, ic, and Id based upon observed
biochemical and clinical heterogeneities (1, 2, 5-9). GSD type
LaSP is clinically indistinguishable from type la and was proposed to be caused by a defect in a 21-kD stabilizing protein,
SP, purified on the basis of its ability to stabilize the G6Pase
catalytic unit in vitro (5, 10). Only one patient has been diagnosed with the type 1aSP disorder (5). G6Pase activity is very
low or non-detectable in liver biopsy samples from GSD type
la and 1aSP patients, regardless of the assay conditions. GSD
type lb patients suffer, in addition to the clinical symptoms
observed in type la, neutropenia, neutrophil dysfunction, and
recurrent bacterial infections (11, 12). Only a few cases of GSD
type lc have been reported and there is insufficient information
for a general description of its clinical symptoms. Glucose-6-P
or pyrophosphate hydrolytic activity in GSD type lb and lc
patients, respectively, is totally or partially inactive in fresh
liver biopsy specimens but becomes active after freezing and
thawing or upon detergent treatment of the biopsy samples

(6, 8).
To explain the heterogeneities observed among GSD type
1 patients, two models of G6Pase catalysis have been proposed.
The multi-component translocase-catalytic unit model proposes
that the five GSD subgroups correspond to defects in the G6Pase
catalytic unit (la), the putative SP (laSP), the glucose-6-P (lb),
phosphate/pyrophosphate (lc), and glucose (Id) translocases
(5-9). This model also suggests that the G6Pase catalytic unit,
situated on the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), gains
access to substrates in the cytosol by means of the associated
translocases. The ability to restore enzyme activity in liver biopsy samples of type lb and ic patients upon disruption of
microsomes is consistent with the abolition of the translocation
requirement. However, it is equally possible that activation of
the enzyme after microsomal disruption could be caused by a
conformational alteration of membrane-bound G6Pase, as proposed by the conformation-substrate-transport model (13). The
latter suggests that G6Pase is a single multifunctional membrane
channel protein possessing both catalytic and substrate (or product) transport activities.
Our laboratory has recently characterized the cDNA and
gene encoding the catalytic unit of human G6Pase and identified, for the first time, several mutations in the G6Pase gene of
GSD type la patients (14). Site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression assays demonstrated that these mutations abolish G6Pase activity, establishing the molecular basis of pathogenesis in GSD type la. In the present study, we characterized

the G6Pase gene of GSD type lb, ic, and laSP patients in
order to elucidate whether mutations in the G6Pase gene are
responsible for other GSD type 1 subgroups. We also report
additional mutations in the G6Pase gene of type la patients and
the three most prevalent mutations that cause GSD type la.

Methods
Patients. We have analyzed the G6Pase gene of three GSD type lb,
ic, the single type laSP, and seven type la patients. All
patients present with clinical manifestations of hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and growth retardation. Three patients, MB, KF, and KZ, also
have neutropenia and recurrent bacterial infections, and were positively
diagnosed as GSD type lb by analyzing the glucose-6-P hydrolytic
activity in liver biopsy samples. The activity was absent or partially
present in fresh liver biopsy specimens but became active after freezing
and thawing or upon detergent treatment of the biopsy samples. The
defect in type lb patient MB has been extensively characterized (6, 11).
The type lc patient JJ, whose liver biopsy sample exhibited normal
pyrophosphate hydrolytic activity upon detergent treatment, was reported by Nordlie et al. (8). The single type laSP patient, RP, was
diagnosed and reported by Burchell and Waddell (5). The type laSP
and the seven type la patients were diagnosed by the lack of G6Pase
activity in liver biopsy samples, regardless of assay conditions.
Genomic DNA preparations from type la patient ML (GM00574)
(submitted by Dr. R. Stevenson, Greenwood Genetic Center, Greenwood, NC), type lb patient MB (GM03719) (submitted by Dr. A.
Beaudet, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) were isolated from
lymphoblasts obtained from National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ).
Genomic DNA preparations from the other GSD type 1 patients and
available family members were extracted from blood samples. Genomic
DNA was isolated using a Nucleon [I kit obtained from Scotlab (Strathclyde, Scotland). Peripheral-blood samples were obtained with the informed consent of the patients.
Analysis of the G6Pase gene by polymerase chain reaction and DNA
sequencing. The G6Pase gene of all GSD type 1 patients and available
family members was characterized by amplifying the coding regions of
each of the 5 exons and the corresponding intron-exon junctions by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using five pairs of oligonucleotide
primers containing intronic, 5'-untranslated, or 3'-untranslated sequences of the human G6Pase gene (14). The amplified fragments, I
(306 bp), 11 (191 bp), HI (209 bp), IV (259 bp), and V (646 bp), were
subcloned using a TA cloning kit obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego,
CA) and five or more subclones of each exon were sequenced and
compared to a normal G6Pase gene to identify any mutations.
Construction of G6Pase mutants. The phG6Pase-1 cDNA (G6PaseWT) containing nucleotides 77 to 1156 of the entire coding region
of the human G6Pase cDNA (14) was used as a template for mutant
construction by PCR. The outside primers used in all constructs were
nucleotides 77 to 96 (5'-AGGATGGAGGAAGGAATGAA-3', sense)
and nucleotides 1153 to 1130 (5'-TTACAACGACTfCTTGTGCGGCTG-3', antisense). The two inside primers (nucleotides 1048 to 1074)
for the AF327 mutant are 5'-CGTCTI'GTCCTGCAAGAGTGCGGT(sense) and 5'-ACCGCACTCTTGCAGGACAAGACG (antisense) and
the two inside primers (nucleotides 731 to 754) for mutant G222R are
5'-AGCTTCGCCATCCGA1TITATCTG-3' (sense) and 5'-CAGATAAAATCGGATGGCGAAGCT-3' (antisense). The outside primers contain an additional XhoI or XbaI linker. The amplified fragments were
digested with XhoI and XbaI and ligated into a pSVL vector (Pharmacia
Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ). The sequence of all constructs was
confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Expression in COS-I cells and Northern-blot hybridization analysis.
COS-1 cells were grown at 37°C in Hepes-buffered Dulbecco's minimal
essential medium supplemented with streptomycin, penicillin, and 4%
fetal bovine serum. The WT or mutant G6Pase cDNA in a pSVL vector
was transfected into COS-1 cells by the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine
one type

method (16). Mock transfections of COS-I cells with the pSVL vector
alone were used as controls. After incubation at 370C for 3 d, the
transfected cultures were harvested for G6Pase assays or lysed for RNA
isolation.
RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate/CsCl method
(17), separated by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2
M formaldehyde, and transferred to Nytran membranes. The filters were
hybridized at 420C in the presence of the phG6Pase-l probe as previously described (14).
Phosphohydrolase assay. Phosphohydrolase activity was determined
essentially as described by Burchell et al. (18). Reaction mixtures (100
Ml) contained 50 mM cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mM glucose-6-P,
2 mM EDTA, and appropriate amounts of cell homogenates and were
incubated at 30'C for 10 min. Absorbance of each sample was determined at 820 nm and is related to the amount of phosphate released
using a standard curve constructed by a stock of inorganic phosphate
solution. Results are present as the mean±SD.

Results
The deduced amino acid sequence of the G6Pase catalytic unit
of GSD type lb and Ic patients is normal. To test the two
proposed models of G6Pase catalysis, we have undertaken studies to invoke or eliminate for consideration defects in the
G6Pase gene as a factor in GSD type lb, ic, or 1aSP. Biochemically, the glucose-6-P or pyrophosphate hydrolytic activity in

The liver biopsy specimens of these patients exhibited very low or nondetectable G6Pase activity, regardless of assay conditions. Numbers in

type lb and lc patients becomes active in detergent-treated liver
biopsy samples (6, 8). To determine the status of the G6Pase
gene in type lb and ic patients, we amplified and sequenced
the coding regions of each of the 5 exons and all intron-exon
junctions of this gene. Sequencing data were compared with
those of a normal G6Pase gene to identify mutations.
The G6Pase gene of three type lb patients of diverse ethnic
backgrounds was characterized: a Panamanian (MB), one of the
original patients diagnosed as GSD type lb (6, 11), a Native
American (KF), and a Caucasian (KZ). Sequencing of five to
seven subclones of each exon from the G6Pase gene of all three
type lb patients found no mutations in coding regions and splice
junctions (data not shown), indicating that the encoded G6Pase
catalytic unit is normal (wild type) in each case. These findings
are consistent with the observations that normal levels of
G6Pase activity is found in detergent-treated liver biopsy samples of type lb patients. Therefore, the genetic defect in GSD
type lb patients is not in the gene encoding the G6Pase catalytic
unit.
We also analyzed the G6Pase gene of the type lc patient,
JJ, reported by Nordlie et al. (8), and again, the coding and
intron/exon junction regions of the G6Pase gene of this patient
were normal (data not shown). The findings demonstrate that
the encoded G6Pase enzyme contains no mutations. Our results
strongly support the translocase-catalytic unit model of G6Pase
catalysis (6-9), which suggests that the genetic defect in GSD
type lb or lc patients is in the associated glucose-6-P or phosphate/pyrophosphate translocase gene.
Identification of a mutation in the G6Pase gene of the single
GSD type JaSP patient. To access whether GSD type laSP is
caused by a deficiency of a 21-kD SP essential for G6Pase
activity but otherwise normal G6Pase (5, 9, 10), we examined
the G6Pase gene from the single known patient, RP. It has been
shown that type laSP is clinically indistinguishable from type
la, suggesting that the symptoms observed in this type laSP
patient could be caused by mutations in the G6Pase gene, simi236

lar to type la patients. Sequence analysis indicated that the
sequences of exons 1, 3, 4, and 5 and all intron/exon junctions
in the G6Pase gene of the type laSP patient were normal. However, exon 2 contained a C to T transition at nucleotide 326
converting an Arg at codon 83 to a Cys (R83C) (Fig. 1). All
five subclones contained this mutation, indicating that RP is
homozygous for the R83C mutation. As GSD type 1 is an
autosomal recessive disorder, it is predicted that both parents
would be heterozygous for the mutation. This was confirmed
by sequencing the G6Pase gene of both parents. As expected,
three of the six exon 2 subclones of the G6Pase gene of the
mother and two of the six exon 2 subclones of the G6Pase gene
of the father had the C to T mutation at nucleotide 326 converting an Arg-83 to a Cys (data not shown). The sister of
patient RP, clinically normal, contained two normal G6Pase
alleles (data not shown).
Identification of the R83C mutation in the G6Pase gene of
a homozygous GSD type la patient. The R83C mutation has
been previously identified in two GSD type la patients; both
were compound heterozygotes (14, 15). To determine if the
type laSP phenotype corresponds to patients homozygous for
the R83C mutation, we screened additional type la patients for
this mutation. Sequence analysis indicated that a type la patient,
AN, also carried the R83C mutation in exon 2 of both G6Pase
alleles (Table I). The sequences of exons 1, 3, 4, and 5 of the
gene of patient AN were normal. Moreover, both parents of
AN were heterozygous for the R83C mutation (Table I).
Identification of mutations in the G6Pase gene of six additional GSD type la patients. To understand further the molecular basis of the GSD type la disorder, we characterized, in
addition to patient AN, the G6Pase gene of six additional GSD
type la patients. Among one homozygous and five heterozygous
type la patients, five different mutations at the G6Pase locus
have been identified (Table I). Three of the mutations, R83C,
459insTA (insertion of TA after nucleotide 459 that yields a
truncated G6Pase of 129 residues), and Q347X (a C to T transi-

contains a C to T (boxed) mutation at nucleotide 326 in exon 2 that converts Arg-83 to a Cys (R83C) and a codon (ITC, nucleotides 1058 to
1060) deletion for Phe-327 (AF327) in exon 5.

tion at nucleotide 1118 that converts Gln-347 to a stop codon)
have been previously described (14, 15). Two new mutations,
A\F327 and G222R, were identified in patients CA and ML,
respectively. The genetic heritage of the patients was identified
by the ratio of mutation-containing exon subclones to total subclones analyzed. A ratio of one indicates the patient is homozygous. This was further confirmed by sequence analysis of the
G6Pase gene of the available family members (Table I).
Patient CA is a compound heterozygote; two different mutations were detected in the G6Pase gene of this patient (Fig. 2).
The mutations are R83C and a codon (TTC) deletion for Phe327 (nucleotides 1058 to 1060) in exon 5 (Fig. 2). Patient ML
is also a compound heterozygote containing two different mutations in exon 5 at the G6Pase locus: a G to C transversion at
nucleotide 743 that converts a Gly at codon 222 to an Arg
(G222R) and a C to T transition at nucleotide 1118 that converts
a Gln at codon 347 to a stop codon (Q347X) (Fig. 3).
We have previously characterized the G6Pase gene of four
unrelated GSD type la patients and uncovered four different
mutations, R83C, Q347X, 459insTA, and R295C (a C to T
mutation at nucleotide 962 that converts Arg-295 to a Cys) (14,
15). In summary, we have analyzed the G6Pase gene of one
type 1aSP and eleven unrelated type la patients and uncovered
six different mutations. The relative incidence of the mutations
in the G6Pase alleles are shown in Fig. 4. R83C, Q347X, and
459insTA, which constitute 87% of the observed mutations,
may represent the most prevalent mutations found in GSD
type

la.

Characterization of G6Pase-AF327 and G6Pase-G222R

mutants. The liver biopsy specimens of patients RP, AN, LT,
CA, JD, PG, RH, and ML had very low or undetectable phosphohydrolase activity, suggesting that mutations identified in
the G6Pase gene of these patients inactivated the G6Pase enzyme. In earlier studies, we showed that the R83C, R295C, or
Q347X mutant G6Pase had no detectable phosphohydrolase
activity (14, 15). To investigate the importance of amino acid
residue F327 and G222, we constructed mutants that eliminated
Phe-327 (G6Pase-AF327) or that changed Gly-222 to Arg
(G6Pase-G222R) and analyzed phosphohydrolase activities

after transient expression of WT or mutant G6Pase cDNA into
COS-1 cells (Fig. 5 A). The G6Pase-AF327 mutant generated
no enzyme activity. On the other hand, the G6Pase-G222R
mutant G6Pase had a reproducibly low level of phosphohydrolase activity.
Northern-blot hybridization analysis of G6Pase transcripts
from transfected cells showed that WT as well as AF327 and
G222R mutant G6Pase mRNAs were expressed at similar levels
(Fig. 5 B), indicating that the reduction in enzyme activity was
due to the defect in the G6Pase protein and not due to a decrease
in transfection efficiency.

Discussion
In the present report, we have examined the G6Pase gene of
GSD type lb and Ic patients and demonstrated that the coding
regions and intron/exon junctions are all normal. This is consistent with the observations that, in contrast to the type la disorder, both type lb and lc patients have normal G6Pase activity

the liver biopsy specimens are treated with detergent surmounting an apparent abnormal latency of an otherwise functional G6Pase enzyme in the type lb and Ic patients (6, 8).
Therefore, a search for a mutation outside the coding region of
the G6Pase gene is now unwarranted. Both the clinical and
biochemical heterogeneities observed in the GSD type 1 disorder support the multi-component nature of the G6Pase system
as proposed by the translocase-catalytic unit model of G6Pase
catalysis (6-9). It is now established that at least two or more
loci control the activity of glucose-6-P hydrolysis. The genetic
defect(s) in type lb and Ic patients, also phenotypically deficient in G6Pase activity, remains to be elucidated. Biochemical
analysis of G6Pase activity in liver biopsy samples of type
lb and lc patients has attributed the defects to the putative
translocases essential for G6Pase activity in the in vivo conditions (6, 8). The clinical manifestations of type lb and lc patients appear to be as severe as that of the la patients, arguing
that some other component of the G6Pase complex is equally
important to the hydrolysis of glucose-6-P.
G6Pase is known to be an extremely unstable protein losing
enzyme activity during conventional purification procedures (3,
4). A 21-kD polypeptide has been isolated by Burchell et al.
(10) that is reported to be closely associated with the G6Pase
catalytic unit and responsible for stabilization of the enzyme.
Screening of > 400 human liver biopsy samples, including
those from GSD type 1 patients, with monospecific antibody to
SP detected one specimen from patient RP that lacked SP (5,
9). On this basis, a new subgroup, designated GSD type laSP,
was established. In this report, we demonstrate that the type
once

laSP patient, RP, is homozygous for R83C mutation in the
G6Pase enzyme. The same mutation has been detected in one
other homozygous and five compound heterozygous type la
patients, demonstrating that the homozygous R83C mutation is
not unique to the type "laSP" phenotype.
Several lines of evidence indicate that the G6Pase catalytic
unit is enzymatically active in the absence of the putative SP
and that GSD type laSP, like type la, is caused exclusively by
mutations that inactivate the human G6Pase. First, the ability
of the SP to stabilize G6Pase was not unequivocally demonstrated and the SP may in fact be a ferritin subunit (19). The
diagnosis of the type laSP phenotype was based solely on immunoblots which showed that the liver biopsy sample of patient
RP did not react with an antiserum raised against the putative
SP (5, 9). This patient lacked an SP which has not been demonstrated to be required for G6Pase activity. Second, rat G6Pase
was recently purified to near homogeneity and demonstrated to
be a single polypeptide of 35 kD (20). The purified G6Pase is
enzymatically active in the absence of any associated SP. Third,
the loss of hepatic G6Pase activity of this patient has been
unequivocally demonstrated in the present study to be the result
of a mutation (R83C) in the G6Pase gene. Genetic analysis of
DNA isolated from the parents of RP indicated that the R83C
mutation was inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The
C to T transition in exon 2 (CGT to TGT) in the G6Pase gene
occurs in a CpG doublet, a known hotspot for mutation due to
potential methylation of the doublet (21).
Analysis of the G6Pase gene in eleven unrelated patients
diagnosed as GSD type la and a single patient diagnosed as

whereas the G222R mutation greatly reduced it. The loss of
enzyme activity in G6Pase lacking Phe-327, located in the sixth
putative transmembrane segment of human G6Pase (Fig. 4),
