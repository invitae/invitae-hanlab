SUMMARY Ten useful two allele restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the low density
lipoprotein receptor gene were used for haplotype analysis in 45 unrelated familial hypercholesterolaemic (FH) patients, 60 normal controls, and 32 FH homozygotes, all of whom were white
Afrikaners. Pedigree analysis in 27 informative heterozygous FH and 23 normal families has
shown the segregation of at least 17 haplotypes in the normal population (111 chromosomes)
compared to a predominant association of two of these haplotypes with the disease in the FH
subjects. This association was further confirmed in 32 FH homozygotes, indicating at least two
'founder' members for the disease in the Afrikaner population. Recombination events were not
detected in any of the families studied and we thus conclude that the haplotypes associated with
FH function as specific markers for the disease and will allow presymptomatic diagnosis in
affected families.

The prevalence of familial hypercholesterolaemia
(FH), an autosomal dominant disease characterised
by raised low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
levels, is five to 10 times higher in the Afrikaner
population than has been reported for most other
population groups in the world.1 2 Seftel et al1 have
suggested a 'founder gene effect' to explain this
abnormally high frequency. Clinical studies have
indicated that tendon xanthomas and premature
coronary artery disease (CAD) are encountered
in middle aged FH heterozygotes, while in the
homozygous condition both cutaneous and tendon
xanthomas as well as aortic and coronary atherosclerosis generally appear before the age of 10 years.3
Over recent years it has been shown by Brown
and Goldstein4 that FH is caused by mutations in the
LDL receptor gene. The availability of cDNA and
genomic clones of this gene have now made it
possible to characterise mutations at the DNA
level.4 5 We have previously provided evidence for
the existence of at least two 'founder' FH genes in

the Afrikaner population.6 Four haplotypes defined
by the restriction enzymes PvuII (P), Stul (S), and
NcoI (N) were found to segregate in this population.
In 71% of FH families studied, the defective gene
cosegregated with the rare allele of a NcoI RFLP7
(P1S1N2 haplotype), while the rare allele of a StuI
RFLP8 (P2S2N1 haplotype) segregated with FH in
20% of these families. We now report on haplotype
associations of 10 different DNA polymorphisms at
the LDL receptor gene locus in the normocholesterolaemic and FH populations and in a large
number of FH homozygotes.

Subjects and methods

The FH heterozygous patients and normocholesterolaemic subjects were those previously described.6
Pedigree analyses were performed on 27 of the 45
heterozygous FH patients and 29 of the 60 normal
subjects. Blood samples were collected from 292 of
the FH family members and 130 of the members
from normal families. Thirty-two patients with
homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia from 27

white Afrikaner families, attending lipid clinics at
the Tygerberg, Johannesburg, Groote Schuur, and
Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospitals,
South Africa, donated blood samples for DNA

analysis.
The homozygous state of FH was diagnosed on
the basis of the following criteria': (1) plasma
cholesterol concentrations greater than 15 mmol/Il;
(2) the appearance of xanthomas in the first decade
of life; and (3) hypercholesterolaemia or early CAD
in the parents of the proband.
Methods used in determination of lipoproteins,
preparation of DNA, restriction endonuclease
digestion, transfer to nitrocellulose, and prehybridisation to nick translated DNA probes have
been described elsewhere.6 Filters were washed as
described with a final wash in lxSSC (0.15 mol/l
NaCl, 0*015 mol/I Na citrate) at 65°C. Three human
DNA probes for the LDL receptor gene were used
in this study. Probe 1, pLDLR-2HH1, consists of a
1*9 kb fragment of the 3' end of the LDL receptor
cDNA clone9 and was obtained from D W Russell of
Dallas. Probe 2 was a 1-05 kb PstI fragment

subcloned from pLDLR-3, a full length LDL
receptor cDNA; pLDLR-3 was obtained from the
American type culture collection (ATCC). Probe 3
was a 3-8 kb ApaI fragment of pLDLR-3. The
RFLPs determined were those for the restriction
enzymes

Haplotypes identified by 10 DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms
terised by the 10 different polymorphic sites have
been calculated for 60 normocholesterolaemic and
45 unrelated FH heterozygotes (table 2). All variants
showed autosomal codominant inheritance and the
distribution of homozygotes and heterozygotes
at each site was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg
equilibria determined from the individual allele
frequencies. We previously reported a statistically
significant excess of the rare allele of the NcoI RFLP
in our FH population (X2=17 2 1 df, p<0-005). An
increase has also been found in the rare allele of the
ApaLl (3') RFLP (X2=59-1, p<0-005), and common
alleles of the AvaIl (X2=6-7 p<0-01), ApaLI (5')
(X2= 14.6, p<0005), PstI (X2=10X4, p<0005), and
TaqI (X2=4-2 p<005) RFLPs in FH patients
compared to normocholesterolaemic controls. This
indicates population association of these alleles with
the gene predisposing to hypercholesterolaemia.

We compared the allele frequencies of the 10 RFLPs
at the LDL receptor gene in the normal South
African population with the frequencies published
for populations in other countries. The frequencies
of the common and rare alleles of the TaqI RFLP
reported for the Japanese10 differ significantly from
those observed in our population (X2=33*7, p<0005)
(table 2). Differences were also found with alleles
defined by the AvaIIl3 (6 =6.5, p<0025), PvuII'5
(X2=4.3, p<0-05), MspI (X2=6-0 p<0025), and
ApaLI (3 )14 (X2=19-7, p<0-005) RFLPs reported
for Caucasians.

*See text.

By assigning a '1' for the presence of a common
RFLP allele and a '2' for the rare allele, haplotype
arrangements for all 10 polymorphic sites taken as a
unit have been determined in 111 normal chromosomes. Haplotype status was assigned by family
studies (73 chromosomes) or by homozygosity for at
least nine of the 10 RFLPs (38 chromosomes).
Haplotypes not associated with the disease in FH
subjects and families were also counted as normal.
Pedigree information was not available for 10 FH
subjects and 22 normal subjects heterozygous for
two or more of the RFLPs and were therefore
omitted from this analysis.
We observed marked linkage disequilibrium
between the 10 polymorphic sites at the LDL
receptor gene locus. Since each of these sites
distinguishes two alleles, there are 1024 (210) possible
haplotypic arrangements. Only 17 of these were
detected in the 111 chromosomes studied and are
listed in table 3 together with their respective

the RFLP homozygotes (69% of the total FH
alleles), while haplotype 6 segregated in six informative families (34 normal and 44 affected offspring)
and the remaining RFLP homozygote (20%).
Four separate haplotypes (1, 3, 4, and 13) were
found in association with the FH phenotype in the
remaining four informative families (3%).
The haplotypes determined for 32 FH homozygotes (from 27 kindreds) are shown in table 5.
Twenty-nine of these subjects, representing 24
separate kindreds, were homozygous for haplotype
2, while subjects 8, 383, and 884 (table 1) showed
compound heterozygosity for haplotypes 2 and 6.
These results establish a clear predominance in the
FH population studied of the two haplotypes among
the 17 observed in the normal South African
population.
Discussion
A total of 10 useful two allele probe-enzyme
systems, spanning a distance of 45 kb, were used for
RFLP haplotype studies at the LDL receptor gene
locus. We have shown marked linkage disequilibrium
between these 10 markers, since only 17 haplotypes
among 1024 possible haplotypic combinations were
observed in 111 chromosomes from the normal
South African population. This finding is in keeping
with other RFLP studies at the immunoglobulin
(200 kb) and , globin (60 kb)18 loci where linkage
disequilibrium was also shown over relatively short
genetic distances. The major reason for this phenomenon is the close proximity of the polymorphic
sites and the resulting low frequency of their
separation through recombination events. This was
evident in our study of several two and three

generation families where no recombinants were
detected.
We have found significant differences in the
frequency of five of the 10 RFLPs at the LDL
receptor locus in South African Afrikaners compared
with populations in other countries. This most
probably also indicates differing haplotype frequencies. Discrepancies in the number and frequency of
haplotypes between populations have been ascribed
to selective advantage for certain alleles, or genetic
drift associated with the effects of migration.
Founder effects also play a role and probably
underly the distinguishing RFLP frequencies in our
Afrikaner population. A founder effect is well
documented in this group which has remained
isolated through religious belief and cultural bonds.
Pedigree analyses in normal and FH families have
shown the presence of a small number of haplotypes
in normal chromosomes. Only two of these haplotypes are associated with FH in the homozygous FH
patients and we thus conclude that the defective
LDL receptor genes associated with these haplotypes
(2 and 6) account for the founder effect in the
Afrikaner and probably represent two separate gene
defects. Only four of the FH families studied (11%)
have shown association with other haplotypes (1, 3,
4, and 13), which probably correspond to the 10
times lower FH frequency found in other population
groups.
The nature of the alteration in the DNA structure
of the LDL receptor genes underlying FH in the
Afrikaner population has not yet been reported.
Our results clearly indicate that haplotypes function
as specific markers for FH in affected families. Early
detection of carriers is thus possible, allowing for
dietary and life style modification to reduce the
subsequent risk of early heart disease.

We thank Professor G M B Berger for the inclusion
in the study of FH patients attending the lipid clinics
at Groote Schuur and Red Cross Children's Hospitals, Sheila Baker and the nursing staff of Genetic
Services, Department of Health and Welfare for
collecting the blood samples, and Ina Jordaan for
