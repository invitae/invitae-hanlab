Ten useful two allele restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene were used for haplotype analysis in 45 unrelated familial hypercholesterolaemic (FH) patients, 60 normal controls, and 32 FH homozygotes, all of whom were white Afrikaners. Pedigree analysis in 27 informative heterozygous FH and 23 normal families has shown the segregation of at least 17 haplotypes in the normal population (111 chromosomes) compared to a predominant association of two of these haplotypes with the disease in the FH subjects. This association was further confirmed in 32 FH homozygotes, indicating at least two 'founder' members for the disease in the Afrikaner population. Recombination events were not detected in any of the families studied and we thus conclude that the haplotypes associated with FH function as specific markers for the disease and will allow presymptomatic diagnosis in affected families.
