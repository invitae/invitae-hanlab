SUMMARY:
Amyloid fibril protein (SKO-III) of 14K daltons associated with
familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy of Jewish type was identified by Pras et
al. as a prealbumin variant with a single amino acid substitution of a glycine
for a threonine at position 497 mainly based on data obtained by automated
sequence analyses.
Structural re-investigation of SKO-III was performed by
comparing
tryptic peptide maps of SKO-III and normal human prealbumin.
The
present analysis reveals that the reported replacement at position 49 is not
present
in the molecule of SKO-III. SKO-III should be revised to be a
prealbumin variant with one amino acid substitution of an
isoleucine for
a
phenylalanine at position 33. ©1984Acad~icPress. Inc.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials:
SKO-III amyloid fibril protein, isolated from amyloid deposits
of a Jewish patient (SKO),
was kindly donated by Dr. Pras,
Tel-Aviv
University, Israel.
The specimen,
showing a single band on polyacrylamide
disc electrophoresis,
was used for
the present analysis without further
purification because the amount of sample was very limited.
Human plasma
prealbumin subunit (Behringwerke) was used as a control.
Tryptic peptide mapping: Normal prealbumin and SKO-III were treated with 70~
formic acid for 12 hr at room temperature and lyophilized.
Each was then
digested by trypsin (Worthington) treated with L-l-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl
chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) in 0.2 M ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) for 2 hr at
37°C (E/S ratio= 1/50, w/w).
The tryptic digests were separated by reverse
phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a column of TSE ODS120A as described in the legend of Fig.l. Peptides not completely resolved
were further chromatographed on a ~-Bondapak C-18 column (Waters) with a
linear gradient of CH3CN (0-50~) in I0 mM ammonium formate (pH 4.0).
The
isolated
peptides
were used for amino acid analysis
and sequence
determination.
Amino acid analysis and sequence determination:
Amino acid analysis was
carried out on a Hitachi #835 automatic amino acid analyzer, after hydrolysis
of the peptides in 6 N HCI containing 0.i~ phenol and 0.02~ 2-mercaptoethanol
for 20 hr at IIO°C.
Sequence analyses of each peptide were mainly performed
by the dansyl-Edman method.
Carboxy-terminal
sequence

T-4
and
T-4S
by
carboxypeptidase digestion: Peptides T-4 and T-4S (each 0.5 nmole) were first
digested by carboxypeptidase B (Boehringer) (E/S ratio= I/l, w/w) in 0.2 M Nethyl-morpholine acetate buffer (pH 8.0) for 30 min at 37°C. Carboxypeptidase
A (Sigma)
(E/S ratio= Ill, w/w) was then added to the solution and it was
incubated for 60 min at 2 5 % .
Analyses of amino acids released after
enzymatic digestion were performed on a picomole level with a pre-labeling
analysis system (Waters).
Aliquots taken out at appropriate time intervals
were each mixed with 0.05 N HCI, then subjected to fluorescence-labeling prior
to
analysis by treating with o-phthalaldehyde in the presence of 2-

mereaptoethanol. Analysis was performed by reverse phase MPLC on a Resolve C18 column (Waters).
Edman degradation:
The manual Edman degradation procedure was modified to
sequence smaller quantities of peptides. The resulting PTH-derivatives were
identified by reverse phase HPLC on an Ultrasphere ODS column (Altex).
