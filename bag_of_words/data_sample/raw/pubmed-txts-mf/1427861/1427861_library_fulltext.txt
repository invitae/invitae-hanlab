we have identified a mutation, Q188R, located in exon 6

more than 60% of the GALT alleles tested from patients
with classical galactosemia. A number of other less prevalent sequence changes are also described.

INTRODUCTION
Classical galactosemia is a potentially lethal disease
caused by a deficiency of galactose-l-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT), the second enzyme in the Leloir
pathway for the conversion of galactose to glucose. The
clinical picture in newborns exposed to dietary galactose
includes hepatocellular dysfunction, aminoaciduria, failure to thrive, cataracts, and sepsis (Segal, 1989). These
symptoms can be reversed by prompt institution of dietary galactose restriction. However, the long-term
prognosis for these children is clouded by the specter of
mental retardation and verbal dyspraxia in patients of
both sexes and primary ovarian failure in females (Waggoner et al., 1990).
Investigation of GALT activity in humans has revealed a significant number of electrophoretic and activity variants. It appears that most patients lacking detectable GALT activity do produce some inactive protein
(Banroques et aL, 1983). However, the variability in
long-term outcome among patients with essentially no

MATERIALS

AND METHODS

Enzymes and biochemical reagents. Restriction endonucleases and
DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Boehringer-Mannheim, New England Biolabs, Inc., Bethesda Research Laboratories,
and Promega. [a-85S]dATP (650 Ci/mmol), [a-a2p]dATP (3000 Ci/
mmol), and [~-32p]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from D u P o n t /
New England Nuclear. DNA purification matrix (Prep-A-Gene) was
purchased from Bio-Rad and nucleic acid purification columns were
obtained from Qiagen, Inc. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized
on an Applied Biosystems oligonucleotide synthesizer.
Patient samples. Genomic DNA from white blood cells or lymphoblastoid cell lines was obtained from patients cared for in the Biochemical Genetics clinic at Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati,
Ohio, and the Division of Medical Genetics, Emory University School
of Medicine. A larger population of galactosemic patients was also
screened by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme analy-

sis to determine the prevalence of certain sequence changes. DNA
from these patients was contributed by genetic centers in Cincinnati,
Atlanta, Oregon, and western Great Britain. All patients had wellcharacterized clinical phenotypes supported by enzymologic confirmation. Control DNA was obtained from phenotypically normal
adults (all from Cincinnati) who were unrelated and had no family
history of galactosemia. Patients and families gave informed consent
to participate in this project and the work was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Children's Hospital Medical Center and
Emory University.
Isolation of the human GALTgene. An EMBL 3 Sp6-T7 library of
human placental genomic DNA (Clontech) was screened by in situ
plaque hybridization (Benton and Davis, 1977) using a randomly labeled probe prepared from a 1000-bp XhoI fragment of hGALT pCD
(Reichardt and Berg, 1988), provided by Juergen Reichardt. This
probe included nucleotides encoding amino acid 114 through the polyadenylation site of the human GALT cDNA. The 5' end of the gene
was isolated from a cosmid clone generously provided by Juergen Reichardt. This clone was originally isolated from a cosmid genomic library using a probe derived from the 5' end of hGALT pCD.
Sequence analysis. DNA from phage isolates was subcloned into
pBS S/K (Stratagene) and sequenced as double-stranded DNA with
Sequenase (U.S. Biochemical). All nucleotides were determined on
both coding and noncoding strands. Sequence analysis was performed
using the Microgenie Software Program (Beckman).
Identification of human GALT mutations. GenomicDNA was isofated from transformed lymphoblasts (Bird et al., 1981) or whole blood
(Kawasaki, 1990) and subjected to amplification using two pairs of
oligonucleotide primers. PCR primer pair i amplified a 1700-bp fragmerit extending from exon 1 (AACCTTCCGGGCAAACG)to intron
G (GGGGACACAGGGCTTGGC).For each reaction, 1 ~g of genomic
DNA was amplified in a 100-#1 volume containing 20 pmol of each
primer, 2 mM MgCI~, 1 mM dNTPs, 50 mM KC1, 10 mM Tris. HC1,
pH 8.4, 0.1 mg/ml gelatin, and 2.5 U Taq polymerase. Thirty cycles of
amplification were carried out with the following thermal profile: 1
min at 94°C, 2 rain at 55°C, and 2 rain at 72°C, with a final extension
of 10 min at 72°C. The amplified DNA was modifiedwith Klenow and
then digested with SacI; from the resulting three fragments, the 1040bp (exons 2-5) and the 380-bp (exons 6-7) fragments were gel purified
and subcloned into pUC19. Plasmid DNA was isolated on Qiagen Tip
20 followingthe manufacturer's recommendations and sequenced using vector or human GALT-specific oligonucleotide primers. PCR
primer pair 2 amplified a 925-bp fragment extending from intron G
(CTCCGGCTCCTATGTCAC) to intron J (CAACAGAAGTATCAGGTGCC), using the same reaction conditions and thermal profile
as described above. Amplified DNA from primer pair 2 was directly
subcloned into PCR 2000 (Invitrogen). Each mutation was characterized by sequencing three or more independent subclones or by restriction digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis of amplified DNA.
RESULTS

Isolation of the H u m a n G A L T Gene
F r o m 5 X 105 phage plaques screened initially, 6 phage
were plaque purified a n d f o u n d to c o n t a i n exon sequences s p a n n i n g from nucleotide 111 of the c D N A
(Flach et al., 1990) to the p o l y a d e n y l a t i o n signal, along
with 10-14 kb of 3' flanking sequence. T h e s e phage appeared to be identical b y S o u t h e r n analysis. Since we
would have expected to find only one copy of the G A L T

ing the 5' end of the gene were identified from this library. S o u t h e r n blots of genomic D N A (data n o t shown)
suggested t h a t the missing nucleotides were located
within 500 bp of the 5' end of the previously isolated
phage. T o identify these sequences, we analyzed a cosmid clone generously provided b y J u e r g e n Reichardt.
W e d e t e r m i n e d t h a t the cosmid a n d phage clones cont a i n e d overlapping regions of D N A b y c o m p a r i n g their
restriction maps. Restriction f r a g m e n t s of the cosmid
t h a t hybridized to a probe derived from the 5' end of the
h u m a n G A L T c D N A were subcloned a n d sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed t h a t the cosmid clone cont a i n e d sequences derived from the 5' flanking region of
the G A L T gene as well as the coding region for the first
27 a m i n o acids of h u m a n G A L T .

Structure of the H u m a n G A L T Gene
T h e h u m a n G A L T gene consists of 11 exons separated
by 10 i n t r o n s (Fig. 1). T h e gene is relatively small, spanning 3900 bp from the start of the published c D N A to its
3' terminus. Figure 2 shows the nucleotide sequence of
the entire h u m a n G A L T gene a n d the deduced a m i n o
acid sequence of the h u m a n G A L T protein. All splice
j u n c t i o n s followed the G T / A G rule. T h e respective sizes
of the exons a n d introns are detailed in Table 1. T h e r e is
a single A l u repeat in i n t r o n J. N o other repetitive regions were f o u n d nor were regions h o m o l o g o u s to o t h e r
genes identified in a search of the Genetic Sequence
D a t a Bank. T h e coding region of this gene agrees precisely with the published c D N A (Flach et al., 1990) except at codons 258 a n d 259. In the gene, the sequence at
nucleotides 2146 t h r o u g h 2154 is C G T C G G C A T , with a
deduced a m i n o acid sequence of A r g - A r g - H i s . A careful
resequencing of the cloned G A L T c D N A confirmed t h a t
this is also the correct sequence for the cDNA. It is therefore likely t h a t the misplaced C in the previously rep o r t e d c D N A sequence reflects a c o m p r e s s i o n artifact of
sequencing.

Variation of A m i n o Acid Sequence Homology
in Different Exons
T h e deduced a m i n o acid sequences of E. coli, yeast,
mouse (N. Leslie, G e n B a n k Accession No. M96265),
a n d h u m a n G A L T are highly conserved. T h e overall
a m i n o acid identities with respect to h u m a n G A L T are
46, 39, a n d 87% for E. coli, yeast, a n d mouse, respectively. However, a c o m p a r i s o n of G A L T sequences from
these three species reveals long stretches of a m i n o acid
sequence w i t h o u t m u c h a p p a r e n t homology. Analysis of
the k n o w n a m i n o acid sequences by exons as defined in
the h u m a n G A L T gene shows t h a t two of these, exon 6
a n d exon 10, are strikingly well conserved, while others,
e.g., 1, 2, 5, a n d 7, are poorly conserved with respect to
overall a m i n o acid identity (Table 1). E x o n 1 is n o t a b l y

(Field et al., 1989), corresponds to an identical amino
acid sequence in human G A L T exon 6. T h e amino acid
sequence of this exon is conserved 100% between human
and mouse and 79 or 74% between human and E. coli or
human and yeast, respectively. T h e localization of other
conserved amino acid patches within exon boundaries
may suggest a domain structure delineating other functional elements in the G A L T protein.

Sequence Changes in the Human GALT Gene
Sequence analysis of amplified genomic DNA from 10
patients with abnormal G A L T activity (6 classical galactosemic GG patients, 1 galactosemia-Duarte heterozygote, 1 Duarte homozygote, 1 Duarte carrier, and 1 compound heterozygote for galactosemia and the Los Angeles allele) revealed a variety of nucleotide changes
leading to amino acid substitutions (Table 2). We identified a common sequence change, Q188R, in exon 6,
very close to the putative active site (Fig. 2). This change
was also recently reported by Reichardt and colleagues
(1991). We observed t h a t this mutation results in the
creation of a HpaII restriction enzyme site in the DNA
sequence and designed a rapid detection method for
Q188R based on this observation (Fig. 3). Using this
method, we examined another 26 GG patients and found
the Q188R mutation in 42 of the total 64 galactosemia
alleles from GG patients. In contrast, this mutation was
found in none of over 40 control alleles screened (Table
3). Th e amino acid change N314D, first described by
Reichardt and shown to have a neutral effect on enzyme
activity in transfection studies (Reichardt and Woo,
1991), was observed in 15% of G A L T alleles from random nongalactosemic controls. This sequence change
was not seen in any GG patients but was found in all
subjects with D alleles or LA alleles. Each of the other
amino acid changes listed in Table 2 was found in only a
single allele and represented the only amino acid change
identified in the sequences examined (exons 2-10 along
with at least 10 bp of intronic DNA flanking each exon).
Therefore, our frequency data strongly support the designation of Q188R as a mutation and N314D as a polymorphism with possible linkage to Duarte or Los Angeles alleles. Two sequence changes, R333G and K334R,
were particularly problematic because they occurred in
individuals with electrophoretic genotypes t hat sug-

gested compound heterozygosity (GD and G-Los Angeles). Both of these changes were amenable to restriction analysis: R333G deletes a HpaII site, K334R creates
a HinfI site. We analyzed a number of DNA samples to
determine whether these sequence changes could be
found in individuals with similar genotypes or in controls. We found the changes only in the original patients
and have designated t hem as candidate galactosemia
mutations in Table 3.
DISCUSSION
In this paper, we have described the complete structure and sequence of the human G A L T gene and demonstrated a strategy for amplification of most of the gene
using the polymerase chain reaction. Using this amplification strategy, we have isolated and studied G A L T sequences from a number of galactosemic patients. We
have identified nucleotide changes t hat may account for
the altered or absent G A L T enzyme function observed
in these patients. In each of the 19 abnormal alleles studied by sequence analysis, we found one and only one
candidate mutation. One such sequence change, Q188R,
is particularly striking because of its frequency as well as
its location two amino acids downstream of the H isP r o - H i s sequence t hat has been shown to be essential
for catalytic function in E. coli GALT. In contrast, several of our amino acid changes are located in evolutionarily conserved regions distant from this presumed catalytic site. Determination of the effect of these changes
on enzyme activity and stability should begin to allow
the construction of a functional map of the human
G A L T protein.
From their analysis ofE. coli GALT, Field et al. (1989)
noted that substitution of His 281 (corresponding to human His 300) and His 298 (corresponding to human His
321) with asparagine residues conferred decreased but
detectable G A L T activity. Both of these residues are located in conserved amino acid patches in human exons 9
and 10. In this context, it will be interesting to determine
if K285N also results in decreased but detectable G A L T
activity.
T he population surveyed in this study, which included
15 patients homoallelic for Q188R, showed considerable
variability in initial presentation. Many of the patients
studied are too young to make any meaningful conclu-

sions about long-term intellectual function or ovarian
function. Therefore, a large clinical study, complemented by careful expression analysis of various genotypes, could add substantially to our understanding of
variable prognosis in galactosemia. Further examination
of the reported 10% residual activity of Q188R alleles in
expression analysis (Reichardt et al., 1991) will also be
important, since all of our patients homoallelic for
Q188R had undetectable GALT activity in their red
blood cells and three patients homoallelic for Q188R
also had undetectable GALT activity in transformed
lymphoblasts (J. Fridovich-Keil, unpublished). P C R

amplification of genomic DNA followed by mutation
analysis could also be used to supplement existing methods for prenatal diagnosis of galactosemia in chorionic
villus tissue (Rolland et al., 1986) or cultured amniocytes
(Fenson et al., 1974) or to clarify a suspected diagnosis of
galactosemia in an infant who has received a red blood
cell transfusion (Sokol et al., 1989).
The frequency of Q188R in our population differs substantially from that reported by Reichardt et al. (1991),

Genomic DNA was amplified with primer pair 1, ethanol precipitated,
digested with HpaII, and electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel. A single
HpaII site is present in wildtype DNA; the Q188R mutation creates a
second site, resulting in the appearance of two smaller bands in place
of the 589-bp band.

T h e a p p a r e n t association between N 3 1 4 D a n d the
D u a r t e a n d Los Angeles genotypes is interesting, especially since the genetic basis for these v a r i a n t s has n o t
been established. T h e frequency with w h i c h this polym o r p h i s m appears in r a n d o m controls is higher t h a n the
reported frequency o f D u a r t e alleles a n d Los Angeles
alleles in one p o p u l a t i o n s t u d y (Vaccaro e t al., 1984). It is
possible t h a t some of our N 3 1 4 D controls are also
D u a r t e or Los Angeles variants. W e were unable to s t u d y

is planned.
A l t h o u g h G A L T activity has been f o u n d in all tissues
t h u s far examined, the a m o u n t of activity observed varies by tissue a n d by age at the time of assay. In particular, considerable variability is seen in the perinatal period (Rogers e t al., 1989; S h i n - B u e h r i n g e t al., 1977). T h e
5' flanking region of the h u m a n G A L T gene is similar to
t h a t observed in o t h e r " h o u s e - k e e p i n g " genes in t h a t it
lacks an obvious T A T A box a n d is very GC rich (Dynan,
1986). T h e classification of G A L T as a house-keeping
gene does n o t imply lack of t r a n s c r i p t i o n a l regulation,
however. I n s p e c t i o n of 300 bp of sequence 5' to the A T G
revealed a C C A A T sequence a p p r o x i m a t e l y 70 bp ups t r e a m of the end of the published c D N A as well as two

a n y f u n c t i o n a l significance. T h e role of tissue-specific or
d e v e l o p m e n t a l l y regulated factors in altering transcription or splicing events, a n d the d e t e r m i n a t i o n of
w h e t h e r these processes play a n y role in the p a t h o p h y s i ology of galactosemia, will be the subject of f u r t h e r investigation.
