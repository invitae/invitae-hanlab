Clinical Investigation
Differences in Clinical Expression of
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Associated
With Two Distinct Mutations in the
/3-Myosin Heavy Chain Gene
A 908Leu--Val Mutation and

a

403Arg-gGln Mutation

Background. The disease gene for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been identified as the
f-myosin heavy chain (fj-MHC) gene in some HCM families. We describe extensive clinical evaluations
in two kindreds with two distinct point mutations in the f-MHC gene.
Methods and Result. We used single-strand confirmation polymorphism (SSCP) gel analysis of polymerase
chain reaction-amplified products capturing each of the 40 f-MHC gene exons to identify distinct missense
mutations in two HCM kindreds. Clinical, ECG, and echocardiographic studies were performed in the two
A1vaI mutation and kindred 2002 with amino acid 403`9`JB
kindreds: kindred 2755 with amino acid 908
mutation. The morphological appearances of HCM were similar in these two kindreds. However, the two
kindreds differed with respect to disease penetrance, age of onset of disease, and incidence of premature
sudden death. Twelve of 31 adults (>17 years) with the disease gene in kindred 2755 did not have left
ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and only five of these had ECG abnormalities. Thus, the disease penetrance
in adults with this mutation was only 61%. None of 11 children aged <16 years had LVH. The 908 mutation
was associated with a low incidence of cardiac events: Only two sudden deaths and one syncope occurred in
46 individuals with the mutant allele. In contrast, LVH was present in all 11 adults in kindred 2002 with the
403 mutation (100% disease penetrance). In addition, three of four affected children were symptomatic and
had clinical evidence of HCM. The disease in this kindred was severe and resulted in six premature sudden
deaths. Seven additional patients had syncope or presyncope.
Conclsions. In some kindreds, the HCM disease gene is more prevalent than indicated by echocardiography
and ECG. Some point mutations may be associated with a more malignant prognosis. Preclinical identification of children with mutations associated with a high incidence of sudden death and syncope provides the
opportunity to evaluate efficacy of early therapeutic interventions. (Circulation 1992;86:345-352)
KEY WoRDs * cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic * f1-myosin heavy chain gene mutations

Fa amilial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is
inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.
Linkage analysis has shown that in less than half
of the kindreds, a disease gene is localized on chromosome
14q.1-3 In these studies involving a total of nine kindreds,
each evaluated separately for linkage, four have shown
either tight linkage or a mutation in the ,B-myosin heavy
chain (,-BMHC) gene on chromosome 14q. In the remaining five, this locus has been excluded as the site of the
disease gene.1-3 Thus, nonallelic genetic heterogeneity of
HCM has been established. Recently, mutations in the
-NMHC gene have been described in two affected famiFrom the Clinical Hematology Branch (N.D.E., G.M.C., F.C.)

Kindred 2002. There was previous evidence of linkage of
the disease phenotype to the f3-MHC gene on chromosome 14 in this kindred as well (LOD score, 2.5 with no
recombinations). An expanded pedigree of 21 individuals
is depicted in Figure 2. Five patients who were not
examined at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) died
suddenly, and the diagnosis of HCM had been made
elsewhere before death or at autopsy. The remaining 15
family members, including a first-generation, married-in

spouse, underwent evaluation at the NIH that included a
12-lead ECG and echocardiographic examination.

Sequencing

The PCR fragments showing polymorphisms by SSCP
analysis were sequenced without subcloning using a
Sequenase kit (USB, Cleveland, Ohio) in one of two
ways. The first method was a modification of the doublestranded sequencing protocol recommended by the
manufacturer. Briefly, four 100-gl PCR products starting with 100 ng of genomic DNA from the individual of
interest were concentrated using a Centricon 30 (Amicon Division, W.R. Grace & Co.). The "stop volume"
was further purified on a 1.0% agarose gel with ethidium bromide, and the gel band was cut out under
ultraviolet light. DNA was extracted from the gel using
Qiaex (Qiagen, Chatsworth, Calif.), denatured in a final
concentration of 0.2N NaOH/0.2 mM EDTA, and precipitated in three times the initial volume of ethanol.
After a wash in 70% ethanol, the pellet was lyophilized
and resuspended in 14 ,ul of water. Seven microliters
was then used in the sequencing reaction as recommended by the manufacturer, with the exception that 1
gl of DMSO was added to the primer/template mix
before boiling for 2 minutes and cooling in ice water.
The second method of sequencing involved the production of single-strand template by modification of a method
described previously.'3 Briefly, a biotin phosphoramidite
(Midland Reagent Co., Midland, Tex.) was used to add a
biotin molecule to the 5' end of an oligonucleotide primer
in the last step in its synthesis on the nucleic acid synthesizer (model 380B, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). This primer, together with its mate that was not
biotinolated, was used to generate the PCR-amplified
fragment to be sequenced. Twenty microliters of this

extracted from isolated nuclei of peripheral white
cells by procedures previously described.8 The published sequence of the human p-MHC gene9 was used to
design a set of intronic primers, each of which encompassed one of the 40 3-MHC gene exons and yielded a
single unique fragment of the expected size in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Intronic
rather than exonic primers were used to avoid the
problem of coamplification of the highly homologous
cardiac a-MHC gene. PCR was performed in a 100-,ll
volume using the Amplitaq enzyme (Perkins Elmer
Cetus, Norwalk, Conn.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations with the exception that a thermocycler oven (Bios, New Haven, Conn.) was used. Each of
the denaturation, annealing, and extension segments
was for 40 seconds, and 35 cycles were performed.
Annealing temperatures of >61MC were used. Radioactive labeling of the amplified fragment was accomplished through the addition of 0.1 ,Ci of a-32P dCTP
3000 Ci/mmol (Amersham, Chicago) to the 100-gl
reaction volume.
Southern blot analysis was performed using previously described techniques10 together with an ammonium acetate transfer technique" onto Hybond N+
nylon paper (Amersham, Chicago). The PSC14 probe
was obtained from HP Vosberg HP and C. Seidman.

ment in a PCR amplification. The products of all 40
primer pairs were consistently suitable for analysis. The
PCR fragments amplified from DNA of the members of
both kindreds were evaluated for the presence of polymorphisms on SSCP gels run at both room temperature
and 4°C. Polymorphic fragments were then sequenced
directly without subcloning as described in "Methods."
These techniques detected several polymorphisms in
both kindreds; however, the sequencing of all the polymorphisms showed that only two reflected changes in
exon coding sequence. Each was unique to one of the
two kindreds, and both involved the replacement of a
highly conserved amino acid. These point mutations in
exons 13 (kindred 2002) and 23 (kindred 2755), together
with the primer pairs used to amplify them, are depicted
in Table 1.
Identification of the 908Leu-Val Mutation in Kindred
2755. All 40 exons of the f-MHC gene, amplified by
PCR from the DNA of a subset of family members, were
evaluated on SSCP gels at room temperature and 4°C.
Only the fragment containing exon 23 was found to
contain a polymorphism that cosegregated with the
disease (Figure 3). Direct sequencing of this fragment in
both directions showed a C->G transversion resulting in
the replacement of a leucine by a valine at amino acid
residue 908 (Figure 4). Subsequent sequencing of a
cDNA clone from an affected member of the family
confirmed this mutation (data not shown). This mutation destroys a Pvu II site, thus lengthening the 140
basepair fragment found in normal individuals to a 161
basepair fragment that is diagnostic of the disease in
this kindred. All 19 individuals in this kindred with
echocardiographic criteria for HCM had this mutation,
which is shown in a subset of the kindred in Figure 5.
This mutation was not seen in a survey of 100 other
chromosomes.
Identification of the Arg-*Gln Mutation in Kindred
2002. The same initial evaluation of the f-MHC gene
exons was performed on a subset of kindred 2002. Only
the two fragments containing exon 3 and exon 13
showed the presence of a polymorphism on an SSCP
gel. Direct sequencing of the exon 3-containing fragment showed the mutation to lie outside of the exon and
splice consensus sites. Direct sequencing in both directions of the exon 13 fragment detected a G->A transition that resulted in the replacement of an arginine by a
glutamine at amino acid residue 403 (Figure 6). This
mutation creates a new Dde I restriction enzyme site by
changing the sequence CTCGG found in normal individuals to CTCAG, thus shortening the 161 basepair
fragment found in normal individuals to a 129 basepair
fragment that is found in all affected members of this

product was then incubated at room temperature, with 20
gl of magnetic beads bound to streptavidin (Dynal, Oslo,
Norway) for 15 minutes. The product, now bound to
beads, was then denatured with 0.2N NaOH, washed with
1X TE, and then washed with water. After the collection
of the beads with a magnet, they were resuspended in 7 gl
of water, and the bound template was sequenced using the
complementary primer according to the manufacturer's
recommendations.

Statistics
Cumulative survival was determined by product-limit
survival analysis using sudden cardiac death, syncope,
and presyncope (profound impairment of consciousness
not amounting to frank syncope) as time variables. Two
product-limit survival functions were compared using
the log rank test. A value of p.0.05 was considered
significant.

a mutation, as has occurred here, corroborates the
specific basepair change that was necessary to create

403 mutation.
Disease Penetrance and Clinical Consequences
of the 908 Mutation
Forty-six individuals were determined to have the
disease mutation: 42 by genetic analysis, two by postmortem findings, and two who were obligate carriers of
the disease gene. Twelve-lead ECGs and echocardiograms were available in the 42 individuals with the 908
mutation confirmed by genotyping. Of these, 11 were
young (age, 1-11 years). All the 11 young patients had
normal echocardiograms except one 12-year old patient, who had an abnormal 12-lead ECG (narrow deep
Q waves in leads III, aVF, and V6). None of the blood
relatives in whom the 908 mutation was absent (n -165)
or married-in spouses (n -37) had a maximum left
ventricular wall thickness of > 12 mm (Figure 7). Of the
31 older individuals with the 908 mutation (age, 17-42
years), 12 had normal echocardiograms with maximum
left ventricular wall thickness of 8-12 mm (Table 2).

FIGURE 6. A portion of the sequence of the polymerase
chain reaction-amplified fragment containing exon 13 from
an affected individual in kindred 2002. The mutant allele is
apparent by the presence of both an A and a G in the first
position of codon 403. This results in the substitution of a
glutamine for a highly conserved arginine in the derived
protein sequence. The affected individual, being a heterozygote
for the mutant allele, has both an A and a G in this position
(marked by an arrow).

Thus, in adult individuals, the disease penetrance as
estimated by echocardiography was 19 of 31, or only
61%. Of the 12 individuals with the mutation who had
normal echocardiograms, five had abnormal 12-lead
ECGs. These were mostly minor and nonspecific (Table
2). The disease penetrance in adults with this disease
mutation by ECG and echocardiographic evaluation
was therefore 24 of 31, or 77%.
The 908 mutation has been associated with a low
incidence of premature sudden death and syncope. Only
two premature (<55 years of age) sudden deaths and
one syncope occurred in the 46 individuals with the
mutation. The cumulative incidence of cardiac- events
(sudden death, syncope, or presyncope) related to age is
shown in Figure 8. Thus, the cumulative sudden deathfree survival rates at 20 and 60 years of age were 97+±3%
and 92+6%, respectively (Figure 8A). Similarly, the
event (sudden death, syncope, or presyncope) -free rates
were 95±3% and 90±6%, respectively (Figure 8B).
Disease Penetrance and Clinical Characteristics
of the 403 Mutation
Of the 20 blood relatives in kindred 2002, 15 have
been diagnosed as having HCM or the 403 mutation. Of
these, six died suddenly between the ages of 19 and 45
years and had markedly hypertrophied hearts at autopsy
examination. Of the nine living individuals with the 403
mutation, seven (age, 6-40 years) have echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy and
abnormal 12-lead ECGs. None of the patients had
abnormal right ventricular echocardiograms. One of the
remaining two individuals, a child aged 8 years, had an
abnormal ECG (narrow deep Q waves and left atrial
hypertrophy). The other, aged 9 months, had a normal
12-lead ECG and echocardiogram. Thus, in this kindred, the 403 mutation was associated with early presentation of the disease and with a 100% penetrance in
adults.
The 403 mutation was also associated with a high
incidence of cardiac events: sudden death in six, syncope in three, and presyncope in four patients. The
cumulative sudden death-free rates at 20, 30, and 40
years of age were 90±9%, 68+16%, and 45±17%,
respectively (Figure 8A). Similarly, the event-free rates
at 20, 30, and 40 years of age were only 70±13%,
46±14%, and 8±7%, respectively (Figure 8B).

Discussion
A detailed clinical evaluation of two of the kindreds
with distinct point mutations in the f-MHC gene demonstrate that different alleles may be associated with
diverse clinical presentations. Both missense mutations
lay in the head or head-rod junction of the molecule,
suggesting the possible occurrence of abnormal interactions between the mutated /3-MI-C molecule and associated proteins such as actin or myosin light chains.
A comparison of kindreds 2755 and 2002, each with
distinct missense mutations (908LcuVat and 403 Arg-GIn
respectively) illustrates that the severity and penetrance
of the disease may be determined by the specific mutation. Of the 195 members of kindred 2755 who were
evaluated clinically, 42 individuals inherited the mutant
allele. Of the 31 individuals .17 years of age with the
mutant allele, 19 had a maximum left ventricular wall
thickness of > 13 mm. In contrast, all 123 blood relatives
without the mutant allele as well as 37 unrelated
spouses had a maximum left ventricular wall thickness
of <12 mm. Thus, 12 adult members with the mutant
allele failed to meet this echocardiographic criterion for

HCM

a

definition of HCM that

stringent

than

that used traditionally to diagnose the disease (maximum left ventricular wall thickness >15 mmt4). Furthermore, seven of these 12 adults also had normal
12-lead ECGs; hence, the disease penetrance for the
adults in this kindred was only 61% when the echocardiographic threshold of >12 mm was used and 77%
when ECG analysis was included in the diagnostic
criteria. In addition, none of 11 children with the
mutant allele had left ventricular hypertrophy on
echocardiogram, and only one child, aged 12 years, had
an abnormal 12-lead ECG.
In contrast to kindred 2755, all 11 adults in kindred
2002 had left ventricular hypertrophy and abnormal
12-lead ECGs. Moreover, of four children with the
mutant allele, two had left ventricular hypertrophy and
three had abnormal 12-lead ECGs. The only child with
normal cardiac findings was a 9-month-old female patient. Thus, the disease penetrance in this kindred was
100% in adults by echocardiographic criteria and 93%
in all ages when the ECG analysis was added to the
diagnostic criteria.

Although the disease penetrance by echocardiographic evaluation was significantly less in kindred 2755
than in 2002, there were many members of kindred 2755
who were symptomatic and had severe left ventricular
hypertrophy. Indeed, the morphological appearances in
affected members of the two kindreds did not differ
significantly. Despite these findings, the incidence of
premature sudden death in kindred 2755 was significantly lower than in kindred 2002 (Figure 8). A high
incidence of premature sudden death associated with
the 403 mutation was also present in a previously
reported French-Canadian kindred with the identical
mutation.1'5 In this French-Canadian kindred, seven
premature sudden deaths occurred in 44 affected
members.
Kindred 2002 is the second family with the 403
mutation described in the literature. The fact that both
kindreds with this mutation exhibit a high incidence of
premature sudden death lends credence to the concept
of mutation-associated disease characteristics. The occurrence of the same point mutation in two kindreds
that we believe are unrelated is intriguing although not
novel in genetics. It is possible that a common ancestor
is responsible for a "common founder effect."'15 Comparison of the locus polymorphism haplotypes in these
two kindreds would address that question. "Hot spots"
for mutations have been proposed as an explanation for
the independent occurrence of the same mutation.
Previously described in the gene encoding factor VIII,16
these hot spots involve methylation of a cytosine in a
CpG dinucleotide and its subsequent spontaneous deamination to thymine. This event however, did not apply
to the 403 mutation. A further consideration is that
myosin is such a critical protein that only a limited
number of mutations is compatible with life, and identical mutations would be expected to occur in unrelated
kindreds.
Only one of the two mutations involved a change in
the charge of the amino acid residue, i.e., the 403
mutation in exon 13. Thus, although a change in charge
may be disruptive and may lead to a defect in the

FIGURE 8. Graphs show comparison of age-related cumulative sudden death-free rates in kindred 2755 (46 individuals
with the 908 amino acid residue mutation in exon 23) and in
kindred 2002 (15 individuals with the 403 amino acid residue
mutation in exon 13) (panel A) and the corresponding
age-related cumulative event-free (sudden death, syncope, or
presyncope) rates in the two kindreds (panel B). Both the

function of the myosin molecule, a substitution without
a charge change in a critical region may have a similar
effect. The question of how these point mutations may
cause HCM is still undetermined. Changes that result
from these base substitutions may affect the functional
integrity of the molecule itself, its interaction with other
myosin molecules (mutated or wild type), or other
molecules that interact with the myosin head. The latter
possibility is particularly interesting, as exon 13 encodes
a region that may bind actin.17 The 908 mutation in exon
23 is located in the 5' end of the rod. Traditionally, the
invariant proline at residue 838 in the human ,B-MHC
gene has been considered to mark the border between
the head and rod portion of the molecule. The use of
specific monoclonal antibodies and physical mapping by
electronmicroscopic studies on a Acathamoeba myosin
II have suggested that the true border is closer to the
900 amino acid residue.18 Thus, the mutation at residue
908, although involving the relatively conservative substitution of a valine for a leucine, occurred at what may
be an important transition portion of the myosin
molecule.
Careful clinical evaluation of HCM pedigrees with
distinct myosin mutations should help to delineate
mutation-specific patterns of disease, as has been described in this study. These, in turn, may prove useful in
prognosis and management of patients. At the molecular level, evaluation of the set of mutant myosin molecules with respect to motility, ATP binding and hydrolysis, actin binding and myosin light chain binding may
further elucidate the etiology of the disease and suggest
strategies for intervention in the disease process.
