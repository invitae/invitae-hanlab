We analyzed the promoter region and all the coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of the protein C gene in a Japanese patient with recurrent thromboembolism
and complete protein C deficiency. By sequencing these fragments we identified a
previously undescribed mutation. A guanine residue was replaced by an adenine
residue converting Gly-292 (GGC) to Ser (AGC) in the last exon coding for the catalytic domain. Substitution of this key amino acid, invariably conserved in the serine
protease superfamily to which protein C belongs, probably leads to destabilization of
the tertiary structure. In a transient expression assay with COS 7 cells, the protein C
level was extremely low in the culture medium of the cells transfected with the mutated protein C expression vector, as compared with the normal vector. In contrast,
the cell extracts contained similar amounts of mutant and normal protein C, suggesting impaired secretion of the mutant protein C. Using mutagenic primers to introduce
a new Pvull site into the mutant allele, we made a study of the family members in this
patient's pedigree, revealing that the mutant allele had been inherited in the affected individuals in this pedigree. (J LAs CuN MED 1992;119:682-9)

The physiologic importance of protein C is clear
from the fact that congenital protein C deficiency predisposes the individual to the development of thromboembolic diseases. 5 •6 Most patients who have protein
C deficiency have only partial deficiency and have approximately 50% of the normal level of protein C activity. 7 Clinical symptoms found in individuals with
deficiency include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, and cerebral infarction. Some individuals
with partial deficiency have relatively infrequent
thromboembolic episodes, which has led to the claim

protein C. The proband is indicated by an arrow. Heterozygous individuals are indicated by a dot in the middle of the circle (females) or a dot in the middle of tile square (males). Protein C enzyme activity and antigen
levels are indicated for each individual in the pedigree and are represented as the percentage of the amount of
activity or antigen found in pooled plasma from 20 normal individuals. Normal protein C activity is considered to fall into the range of 78.3% to 121.7% of the protein C activity found in the pooled blood. Enzyme
activity is written above the bar, and antigen level is shown below the bar.

that partial protein C deficiency alone should not be
characterized as an important risk factor. 8
Individuals with complete protein C deficiency or
those who have extremely low levels of plasma protein C are sometimes identified as having purpura fulminans as newborns. 9 •10 However, some of these imlividuals survive beyond the neonatal period into
adulthood with or without histories of thrombosis. 11
Thus the spectrum of clinical manifestations caused by
protein C deficiency is rather wide. Usually protein C
deficiency is thought to be transmitted as an autosomal
dominant with a high degree of penetrance, but in
families with individuals with complete deficiency,
the mode of inheritance has been classified as an autosomal recessive.
Since the protein C gene has been cloned, 12 it has
become feasible to study hereditary protein C deficiency at the molecular level. It is possible that the
phenotypic heterogeneity of this disorder may reflect
underlying heterogeneity at the molecular level. Thus,
studying DNA sequence abnormalities may be helpful
in explaining the broad range of clinical severity of
protein C deficiency. Only a handful of cases, however, have so far been analyzed at the DNA level. 13 - 16
We sequenced the promoter region and all of the
coding regions and splice junctions of the protein C
gene in a young woman with complete protein C deficiency. We identified a novel point mutation located
in exon IX that would cause substitution of a serine in
place of a conserved glycine residue at amino acid positiqn number 292. Furthermore, we have shown that
this point mutation was inherited by the affected individuals in this family. To elucidate the mechanism by
which the missense mutation causes protein C deficiency, we have performed a transient expression as-

say with COS 7 cells. The mutant protein C was secreted into the culture medium at a very low level,
indicating that this mutation is the molecular basis for
protein C deficiency in this pedigree.
METHODS
Description of the patient and her family. The patient is a
31-year-old woman who reached adulthood without clinical
evidence of thrombosis. Her first thromboembolic episode
occurred at the age of 31 and was an infarction in the right
lateral cerebrum. Since then she has had recunent episodes
of venous thrombosis in both of her legs as well as mesenteric venous thrombosis. The protein C activity and antigen
levels in this patient were undetectable (less than 5% of normal), while the activities of antithrombin III, proteinS, and
plasminogen were within the range of nmmal. Her mother
died at 35 years of age because of a cerebral thromboembolism, and her brother died at birth for unknown reasons.
Fig. I is a pedigree of her family and shows that protein C
activity levels of her father and other relatives are low. It
also indicates that her parents were first cousins. From the
pedigree alone it appears that the patient is homozygous and
that her family members are heterozygous for protein C deficiency.
Plasma and DNA samples. Blood samples were drawn
from the patient, her family members, and normal individuals after informed consent was obtained. Nine parts of blood
were mixed with one part of 3.8% trisodium citrate, and the
plasma was separated by centrifugation at 34,000 g for 15
minutes at 4~ C, then stored at -80° C until use. Genomic
DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes by phenol extraction as previously described. 17
Protein C and other assays. Protein C anticoagulation activity was determined by using protein C-deficient plasma
as a substrate and Protac (Staclot Protein C; Boehringer
Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) as an activator of protein
C. 18 The protein C antigen level was measured by using a

polyclonal rabbit serum against human protein C (Asserachrom Protein C; Boehringer Mannheim).
Protein C activity and antigen levels were expressed as
percentages of those observed in pooled plasma collected
from 20 normal individuals. The pooled plasma was arbitrarily defined as having 100% protein C activity and antigen levels. Assays for the activities of antithrombin III, protein S, and plasminogen were performed as described
earlier. 19
Preparation of oligonucleotide primers. We designed
eight pairs of oligonucleotide primers for PCR (shown in
Table I) that covered the 5' untranslated (presumed promoter) region and all nine exons and exon-intron boundaries
of the protein C gene. These primers have an EcoRI restriction endonuclease cleavage site that is convenient for subsequent cloning and sequencing. All primers were prepared as
described earlier. 20
Performance of PCR. PCR was performed as previously
described21 with the following minor modifications. 22 A 100
j.Ll aliquot of the PCR reaction mixture contained 1 j.Lg of
genomic DNA in 50 mmoi!L KCl, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH
8.3), 1.5 mmoi!L MgC1 2 , 0.01% (wUvol) gelatin, 200
[Lmol/L of each dNTP, 100 pmol of each primer, and 2.5 U
of recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer-Cetus,
Norwalk, Conn.). The mixture was overlaid with mineral oil
to prevent condensation and was subjected to the following
series of steps for a total of 35 amplification cycles. The
samples were denatured at 94° C for 1 minute, annealed at
60° c for 2 minutes, and heated to 72° c for 2 minutes for
polymerization. The reactions were performed in an automatic thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer-Cetus).
DNA sequencing. The PCR products were digested with
restriction endonucleases, then subcloned into M13 vectors.
These subcloned PCR products were then sequenced by the
dideoxy chain termination method as described previously. 20,23

Constructions of expression vectors. An expression vector
for the normal protein C (pEUK-PC) was constructed by insetiing a eDNA fragment coding for protein C into the
pEUK-C1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.) as follows.
The eDNA coding for wild-type protein C was provided
by Dr. Earl Davie, Seattle, Wash., in pUC19. Between two
EcoRI sites, the eDNA for protein C contained 69 noncoding bases 5' of the ATG initiation site, 126 bases of leader
sequence, 1383 bases coding for the entire protein C molecule, and 202 noncoding bases 3' of the TAG stop codon,
this latter region including two poly A signals. This fragment was excised from the pUC19 vector by EcoRI digestion and then ligated into the multiple cloning site of the pBluescript KS II(+) vector. The insert direction was
confirmed by digestion with Nael. For insertion into the
mammalian cell expression vector, the eDNA was excised
from the pBluescript KS II(+) by using an Xbal -XIwl restriction digestion and was inserted into these same restriction sites of the vector pEUK-C1, which has the SV40 late
promoter 5' upstream of the Xbal site.
Mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis of the protein C
coding sequences was performed by using an oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis system (version 2.0; Amersham, Arlington, Ill.). 24 •25 We prepared the following
mutant oligonucleotide

5'-AGGGTCTCCTGGCTGGCCTGATTGAGCTCG-3'
with a DNA synthesizer (model 391; Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, Calif.). The mutant protein C eDNA was sequenced by dideoxy chain termination technique as described earlier, 20 with the double-strand DNA as template,
to verify the mutation and the fidelity of the remaining sequence. The fragment containing the mutated protein C was
inserted into the expression vector (pEUK-mPC).

35 mm wells. Cells (3 X 105 per well) were transfected with
the pEUK-Cl vector containing either the normal or mutant
protein C eDNA by the diethylaminoethyl-dextran technique. 26 The culture medium was removed at 48 hours after
the transfection for protein C measurement. The cells were

confirmed by sequencing five independent clones from

Fig, 3. Strategy for direct detection of a single nucleotide substitution when using mutagenic primers. The
mutation, substitution of a guanine residue with an adenine residue in exon IX of the protein C gene, is indicated by white letters. We used mutagenic primers to replace a C residue (nucleotide 8592) with aT residue
(indicated by T*) and an A residue (nucleotide 8593) with a G residue (indicated by G*). This created a new
Pvuii site (CAGCTG) in the fragments produced by amplification of mutant alleles and yielded two fragments
of 271 base pair (bp) and 29 base pair in length after enzyme digestion. After amplification, the normal allele

did not have this restriction site, so Pvull digestion of
that allele yielded a single 300 base pair fragment.
Thu~ family members carrying the mutation were
identified as those whose DNA was shown by this
analysis to contain two restriction fragments of 271
and 29 base pair in length.
When the genomic DNA fragments of Japanese individuals with normal protein C activity and antigen
levels were subjected to this analysis, Pvuii digestion
yielded only a single 300 base pair fragment in all
cases, indicating that these individuals are all homozygous for the normal allele. Pvull digestion of PCR
products from the patient's family members revealed
that only DNA isolated from her paternal grandfather
(I-1) and paternal uncle (Il-l), who both had normal
protein C activity and antigen levels, did not yield the
two restriction fragments that indicate the homozygosity for the normal allele (Fig. 4). Clones obtained
from the family members who have partial deficiency
in protein C (II-2, II-3, II-4, and II-5) produced two

bands after Pvull digestion: a 300 base pair fragment
and a 271 base pair fragment, indicating that they
each carry one mutant allele and one normal allele.
(The 29 base pair fragment could not be detected in
these gels.) DNA taken from the proband (III-1), who
is completely deficient in protein C, had only the 271
base pair fragment after Pvull digestion, confirming
that she is homozygous for the mutant allele.
Transient expression of recombinant protein C. To ensure that the missense mutation identified in this pedigree could cause the deficiency of protein C, we construct~d a protein C expression vector, pEUK-mPC,
containing the abnormal sequence, as described in
Methods, and trarisfected it into COS 7 cells for a
transient expression assay. An analysis for protein C
in the culture medium and in the cell extracts, as assayed by ELISA with a rabbit polyclonal antibody, is
shown in Table II. About 90% of the normal recombinant protein C synthesized in the COS 7 cells was secreted into the culture medium, whereas the level of

Fig. 4. Analysis by PCR amplification followed by Pvuii digestion of the protein C alleles in the family members of an individual who is homozygous for protein C deficiency. A region of exon IX in the protein C gene
was amplified by PCR with the mutagenic primers described in Fig. 3 and shown in Table I. After amplification by PCR, the exon IX fragments were digested with Pvuii and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 9% gel, then stained with ethidium bromide. We used DNA molecular weight marker 4(<l>Xl74/
Haelll digest) from Nippon gene, Japan, as the marker on the right side. The 29 base pair (bp) fragment was
not detected in this gel. The gel shows that Pvuii digestion of exon IX from all of the individuals in the pedigree who had partial deficiency for protein C produced bands of 271 base pair and 300 base pair in length.
The 271 base pair fragment results from digestion of the mutant allele, and the 300 base pair band results from
digestion of the normal allele. DNA from exon IX of protein C from the individuals in the pedigree who do
not have deficiency of protein C by enzymatic and antigenic analysis (l-1 and Il-l) yielded only a single band
of 300 base pair in length after Pvuii digestion.

the mutant protein C secreted was only about 2% of
that of the normal recombinant protein secreted. Their
cellular contents of protein C, however, did not differ
significantly, suggesting impaired secretion of the mutant protein C.
DISCUSSION

The molecular basis of hereditary protein C deficiency is almost completely unknown in the majority
of p~tients afflicted with this problem. Romeo et al. 13
have reported that mutation of a single nucleotide (a
C-to-T transition) at Arg-306 in one pedigree of a heterozygous deficiency results in a nonsense mutation.
They also described a mutation in which a G-to-C

transversion caused substitution of Cys for Trp-402, a
missense mutation. In the latter case, the disulfide
bonds generated by the variant cystein residue are
thought to interfere with the correct folding of the protein, resulting in destabilization of the molecule.
. Protein C Tochigi 14 and protein C London 15 have
also been reported to be abnormal protein C molecules. In both cases, a C-to-T transition causing replacement of Arg-169 with a tryptophan residue-at
the site of protein C activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex- is thought to be responsible for
defective activation of the molecule and to result in
thromboembolic disorder. More recently a preliminary
rep?rt by Gandrille et al. 16 described the identification

Culture medium samples were collected from 35 mm plates 48 hours
after transfection with protein C expression plasmids. The cells were
harvested with trypsin, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline
solution, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline solution, and lysed by 0.1% NP-40 solution. Protein C levels in the culture medium
and in the cell extracts were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The result was a mean of five separate experiments.

of two mutations in ex on VI (conesponding to exon
VII in the report of Plutzky et al. 29 ), which encodes
the linker and activator portions of the protein C molecule. One of these was a C-to-T transition that created a nonsense codon at Arg-157, and the other was a
G-to-A transition converting Arg-178 to Gln. Further
details of the effect of these mutations on functional
aspects of protein C have not been described.
We have identified a novel point mutation in the
protein C gene of an individual who has complete deficiency in protein C, which causes Gly-292 to be replaced by Ser (Fig. 2). We sequenced the entire protein C gene in this patient and found only this single
point mutation; therefore, it is thought to underlie the
clinical manifestations of protein C deficiency in this
patient. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the DNA abnormality in an individual with
apparent homozygous protein C deficiency.
Glycine-292 structurally conesponds to glycine-133
in eukaryotic serine proteases and in bacterial trypsin. 30 This residue is invariably conserved in serine
proteases that contain this biochemical domain, including bovine prothrombin, the trypsinogens, the
chymotrypsinogens, and pig kallikrein. Computer
simulation of the three-dimensional structure of trypsin indicates that it has one a-helix, two six-stranded
13-sheets, and six disulfide bonds?' Glycine-133 of
trypsin belongs to the group of residues that form
13-sheets, and it is located at the base of the molecule. 31 It is infened that replacing a nonpolar glycine
residue with a polar serine residue at this site in the
protein C molecule influences the three-dimensional
structure, leading to its destabilization or perhaps inactivation.
I
Our transfection experiment data appear to provide
strong evidence for the impairment of the secretory
process of the mutant protein C, because this mutation
significantly reduced the amount of the mutant protein

C secreted into the medium, whereas the cellular content was almost same with normal recombinant protein
C (Table II). Much evidence has been found that abnormal secretory or plasma membrane proteins are often specifically retained within the rough endoplasmic
reticulum and are not secreted. 32 It is conceivable that
this missense mutation causes significant alteration of
protein C that in turn probably causes a substantial
change in its secondary and tertiary structure, thereby
affecting its posttranslational transport through the intracellular secretory compartments. The in vitro study
also suggests the instability of the mutant protein C
within the cells, possibly because of the altered conformation, because no abnormal intracellular accumulation of protein C was observed in spite of the apparently retarded secretion.
The analysis we describe when using PCR with mutagenic primers (Fig. 3) followed by Pvull digestion
provides a relatively easy screening procedure for this
protein C mutation. The variant restriction pattern we
describe here correlates completely with protein C deficiency in this pedigree and is absent in all individuals we have examined who have normal protein C activity and antigen levels. The proband apparently
inherited two copies of the same mutation, one from
each of her parents, who were cousins. It also appears
that the 50% reduction of protein C levels found in
several individuals in this pedigree can be attributed to
this missense mutation, because all those individuals
are heterozygous for the mutation.
