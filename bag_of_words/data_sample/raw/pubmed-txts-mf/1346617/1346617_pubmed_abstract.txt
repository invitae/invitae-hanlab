3-Ketothiolase deficiency (3KTD) stems from a deficiency of mitochondrial acetoacetyl-coenzyme A thiolase (T2). We analyzed the molecular basis of 3KTD in two generations of a family. A boy (patient 2, GK04), his father (patient 1, GK05), his mother, and his brother were studied; three mutant alleles of T2 gene were identified. Patient 1 is a compound heterozygote: one allele has a point mutation of G to A at position 547 on his T2 cDNA, causing Gly150 to Arg substitution of the mature T2 subunit, and the other allele has GT to TT transition at the 5' splice site of intron 8, causing exon 8's skipping of the T2 cDNA. Patient 2 is also a compound heterozygote: one allele inherited from his mother has AG to CG transition at the 3' splice site of intron 10, causing exon 11's skipping of the T2 cDNA, and the other allele derived from patient 1 has the G to A mutation (Gly to Arg). The brother of patient 2 is an obligatory carrier with the mutant allele causing the exon 8 skipping. This report seems to be the first complete molecular definition of 3KTD at the gene level.
