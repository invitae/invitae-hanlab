Abstract
3-Ketothiolase deficiency (3KTD) stems from a deficiency of
mitochondrial acetoacetyl-coenzyme A thiolase (T2). We analyzed the molecular basis of 3KTD in two generations of a family. A boy (patient 2, GK04), his father (patient 1, GK05), his
mother, and his brother were studied; three mutant alleles of
T2 gene were identified. Patient 1 is a compound heterozygote:
one allele has a point mutation of G to A at position 547 on his
T2 cDNA, causing Gly1" to Arg substitution of the mature T2
subunit, and the other allele has GT to TI transition at the 5'
splice site of intron 8, causing exon 8's skipping of the T2
cDNA. Patient 2 is also a compound heterozygote: one allele
inherited from his mother has AG to CG transition at the 3'
splice site of intron 10, causing exon 1l's skipping of the T2
cDNA, and the other allele derived from patient 1 has the G to
A mutation (Gly to Arg). The brother of patient 2 is an obligatory carrier with the mutant allele causing the exon 8 skipping.
This report seems to be the first complete molecular definition
of 3KTD at the gene level. (J. Clin. Invest. 1992.89:474-479.)

Introduction
3-Ketothiolase deficiency (3KTD'; McKusick 203750) is an
inborn error of isoleucine and ketone body catabolism that
shows autosomal recessive traits, caused by a deficiency of mitochondrial acetoacetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) thiolase (T2; EC
2.3.1.9). 3KTD patients present with intermittent ketoacidotic
episodes and urinary excretion of 2-methylacetoacetate, 2methyl-3-hydroxybutyrate, and tiglylglycine (1-4).
Mammalian tissues have at least four thiolases: T2, mitochondrial 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, peroxisomal 3-ketoacylCoA thiolase, and cytosolic acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase. They

differ from one another with respect to molecular, catalytic,
and immunochemical properties (5-7). Among them, only T2
is responsible for the cleavage of 2-methyl-acetoacetyl-CoA, an
intermediate of isoleucine catabolism, and is activated in acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase by the presence of K+ (5, 8).
It was reported that 3KTD fibroblasts lack both the 2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA thiolase activity and the K+ activation of
acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (3, 4, 8). In immunochemical analyses we found that fibroblasts from a 3KTD patient lacked the
T2 protein because of a defect in its biosynthesis (9). We cloned
and sequenced the rat and human T2 cDNAs (10, 1 1), and the
human T2 gene (1 la) to study 3KTD at the gene level. Studies
on the protein biosynthesis and mRNA expression suggested
that the molecular defects of 3KTD are highly heterogeneous
(11, 12).
An uncommon case of a Caucasian family, in which the
father and one of the children were 3KTD patients, was previously reported by Schutgens et al. (3). We describe here the
molecular basis of 3KTD in this family at the DNA level.

Methods
Cases and cell lines. The case report and the in vitro enzyme assay in
fibroblasts of the family have been described elsewhere (3). Briefly,
patient 2 (GK04) had severe attacks of ketoacidosis at the age of 4.5 and
6.5 yr. During the latter period, a diagnosis of 3KTD was made. Patient
1 (GK05) is the father of GKO4. He was asymptomatic but was diagnosed as having 3KTD at the time of familial analysis. The mother and
brother of patient 2 were expected to be obligatory carriers of 3KTD, as
determined by the enzyme assay. Fibroblasts were cultured in Eagle's
minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Data on
the immunochemical analyses and Northern blot analysis of the patients have already been reported (1 1, 12).
Oligonucleotideprimersfor cDNA synthesis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, and sequencing. Oligonucleotide primers for
cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification of T2 cDNA were designed
according to the normal human T2 cDNA sequence (11) as follows:
-03 (5'-AGTCTACGCCTGTGGAGC-3')/

64(3'-ACTTGTCCTGCGAATACGAT-5')
15 (5'-CTACAAGAACACCCATTGG-3')/
100(3'-GGTTAACGAGGACATATACGA-5')
60 (5'-AGCTGTGCTGAGAATACAGC-3')/

135(3'-CACACTGATGACACCCAGT-5')
When the A of the initiator ATG codon was designated base number 1,
the primer pairs -03/64, 15/100, and 60/135 amplified the region
-40-646, 140-995, and 583-1360, respectively. The most 3' antisense
primer (termed as 135) was 57-76 bases downstream from TAG stop
codon.

cDNA synthesis and amplifcation of T2 cDNA. Total cellular RNA
was prepared from fibroblasts by the acid guanidinium thiocyanatephenol chloroform extraction method (13). First-strand cDNAs were
synthesized from 5 gg of total cellular RNA using 0.5 ,ug of the 135
primer. Transcription was carried out at 370C for 60 min in 20 td of
reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 6 mM MgCl2,
40 mM KC1, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM dNTPs (dATP, dGTP, dCTP,
and dTTP), 20 U of RNasin (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Piscataway, NJ), and 10 U of Rous associated virus 2 reverse transcriptase
(Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan). PCR amplification was carried out with
4 ,ul of the above cDNA solution as a template and 1 MM of each pair of
the PCR primers. 40 cycles of PCR (1 min at 94°C, 2 min at 54°C, and
4 min at 72°C) were performed with a DNA thermal cycler and Gene
Amp DNA amplification reagent kit (Perkin-Elmer Cetus Corp., Norwalk, CT).
Subeloning ofPCR-amplifiedfragments and sequencing. After electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel, fragments were excised and purified with
Geneclean II kit (Bio 101 Inc., La Jolla, CA). They were subcloned into
Sma I site of pTZ vector (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH)
after being treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I
(Takara Shuzo) to generate blunt-ended DNA fragments. Sequencing
was performed on plasmid DNA with the Sequenase Kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and [35S]dATPaS (Amersham Corp., Arlington
Heights, IL). For direct sequencing, the purified PCR fragments
(- 25-50 ng) were taken to initiate a second PCR containing only one
of the original primers, as described (14). Sequencing was carried out
with an aliquot of the above solution as a template, Taq DNA polymerase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and 32P-end-labeled oppositestrand primers, as described (15).
In vitro transcription/translation of T2 cDNAs. Each of the normal
and three mutant full-length T2 cDNA was subcloned into an in vitro
expression vector, pTZ1 8U (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). In vitro transcription was carried out with T7 RNA polymerase according to the
protocol recommended by manufacturer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.).
The synthesized mRNAs were translated with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Amersham Corp.) and Tran 35S-label (ICN Biochemicals, Irvine,
CA). Translation products were analyzed in SDS-PAGE after immunoprecipitation with anti-[rat T2]IgG, and were fluorographed.
Genomic DNA amplification and sequencing. Genomic DNA from
fibroblasts was prepared (16). Oligonucleotide primers for gene amplification were designed according to the normal T2 gene sequence (1 1 a),
as follows: for the region surrounding exon 8,

In7B(5'-ATTCTAGATGAGTGTTTACTTGG-3')/
In8A(3'-GTCATATAGTCCGAGTACA-5'),
and for the region surrounding exon 11,
In1OB(5'-GAGACAGAGCAAGACTGTTG-3')/
In I A(3'-GGATGGGTAGAAAGTATTCCG-5').
PCR was carried out with 1 Mg of DNA as a template, according to the
same procedure used for cDNA amplification. Sequencing was performed with subcloned plasmids.

(Fig. 1, arrows). No fragment was amplified with any pair of
primers, when mock cDNA (synthesized without reverse transcriptase) was used as a template (lanes marked with a minus
sign), thereby confirming that the bands were not the result of
accidental contaminations.
Amplified fragments were subcloned to pTZ18U plasmid
vectors and four clones of each fragment were sequenced. Sequencing of the long and short B fragments identified two mutations. In the normal size B fragment, a point mutation G to A
at position 547 (nucleotide number beginning from the first
residue of the initiator ATG triplet) was observed. This mutation should cause an amino acid change from Gly'50 to Arg of
the mature T2 subunit. In the short B and C fragments, there
was a deletion of positions 731-826. This deletion corresponds
to exon 8 of the T2 gene. Since the G to A substitution at
position 547 was present only in the normal size fragment, the
two mutations must be present on separate alleles. All mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing of the amplified
fragments (Fig. 2, A and B). No other mutation was detected in
the T2 cDNA.
Familial analysis in their T2 cDNA. PCR analysis of other
family members with primers 60/135 showed the presence of

Results
Identification ofmutations in T2 cDNA ofpatient 1. We amplified the entire coding region of human T2 cDNA by using three
pairs of primers: -03 and 64 (termed as fragment A), 15 and
100 (fragment B), and 60 and 135 (fragment C) (Fig. lb). A
single band of the expected size was obtained with each primer
pair by amplification of the normal cDNA: 680 bp of fragment
A, 850 bp of fragment B, and 780 bp of fragment C (data not
shown). In case of patient 1, another fragment smaller than the
normal one by about 100 bp was amplified for either B or C

shorter fragment in patient 2 and his mother (Fig. 3, lanes P2

exon 8 and
probes, respectively (data not shown).
When the amplified fragments of patient 2 were sequenced,
the G to A mutation at 547 was detected in the normal size
fragment, for both A and B, whereas the deletion from positions 1006-1162,

precisely corresponding

to the exon

of the

T2 gene, was detected in the smaller fragment C (Fig. 4). No
other mutation was found in the cDNA fragments. In the
smaller fragment C of the mother and the brother, there was a
skipping of exons 11 and 8, respectively.
Hence three mutant alleles were inherited, as shown in Fig.
5. The results are in accord with the observation that the
mother and the brother are obligatory carriers of 3KTD with
respect to the enzyme activity (3).

In vitro transcription/translation ofthe mutant T2 cDNAs.
The skipping of exon 8 does not alter the reading frame of the
T2 mRNA, hence a polypeptide shorter than the normal one
by 32 amino acid residues is expected to be produced. The
skipping of exon 11 is expected to result in not only a loss ofthe
53-amino acid sequence encoded by exon 11 but also in a
frameshift at the carboxyl-terminal portion of T2. Accordingly,
the carboxyl-terminal 92 amino acids may be replaced with a
70-amino acid polypeptide with a different sequence. The relative molecular mass of the T2 precursor translated from normal mRNA, the mRNA with exon 8 skipping, and the mRNA
with

exon

8 skipping (Fig. 6, lane 1) and that with exon 11 skipping (lane

the 5' splice site is indicated by an arrow.

chase experiments of the patients' fibroblasts, we found no
such truncated T2 subunit derived from these precursors even
with a 1-h pulse (12). These observations suggest that these
truncated T2 proteins are extremely unstable.
The polypeptide translated from the mutant cDNA with
G547 to A substitution (lane 4) was almost the same size as that
from normal T2 cDNA (lane 2). Hence, the T2 protein detected in pulse-chase experiments of their fibroblasts ( 12) appeared to have the G"47 to A mutation.
Identification of a 5' splice site mutation of intron 8. To
search for the cause of the exon 8 skipping, the genomic sequence around exon 8 was amplified with In 7B and In 8A
primers. A single fragment, 440 bp was successfully amplified
(data not shown). A point mutation from G to T was detected
in 4 of 10 clones from patient 1; this mutation was located in a
consensus sequence of the 5' splice site (GAAAATGgttagtg to
GAAAATG~ttagtg) (Fig. 7). No other mutation was detected in
the region around exon 8, up to 100 bp in either the 5' or the 3'
direction. This mutation was also detected in the DNA from

the brother but not from patient 2 and the mother; hence, this
mutation is probably responsible for exon 8 skipping.
Identification ofa 3' splice site of intron 11. To examine the
cause of exon 11 skipping, we also sequenced the genomic region around this exon, after amplification with In lOB and In
1 A primers. A point mutation from A to C was detected in
four of seven clones from patient 2 and this mutation was located in a consensus sequence of3' splice site (aatttaagGTTC to
aatttacgGTTC) (Fig. 8). No other mutation was detected in the
regions around exon 1 1, up to 100 bp in either the 3' or the 5'
direction. This mutation was also present in amplified specimens from the mother but not in those from the father (patient

1) and the brother. Presumably this mutation is responsible for
exon 11 skipping.

Discussion
We reported that there is molecular heterogeneity in 3KTD at
protein and mRNA levels of expression (1 1, 12). Our present
study clarified the genetic relation in a family, in which the
father (GK05) and one of the children (GK04) were 3KTD
patients, as described earlier (3). We have defined three mutant
alleles for the molecular basis of 3KTD and described two
point mutations causing exon skipping, with one occurring at
the splice acceptor site. The present study appears to be the first
complete definition of 3KTD, at the molecular level.
Using an immunochemical technique we noted that GKO4
and GKO5 fibroblasts lacked a detectable level of T2 protein, at
a stable state (12). We further observed in pulse-chase experiments using these fibroblasts that a lower level of radioactivity
was incorporated into a normal size of T2 polypeptide at a 1-h
pulse, but when chased it degraded (12). This unstable T2 polypeptide should contain the Glylso to Arg substitution, because
the two truncated forms of T2 polypeptide expressed from
other alleles were not detected even at a 1-h pulse. Hence, this
single amino acid change seems to affect the stability of the
enzyme, thereby constituting a major cause of the disease.
The primary structures of nine thiolases have been reported
(10, 11, 17-23). When these amino acid sequences were
aligned to achieve maximum homologies, the Gly'50 was conserved, irrespective of substrate specificities and origins of the
enzymes, except for human and rat peroxisomal 3-ketoacylCoA thiolases, which are evolutionarily most distant from T2,
as described elsewhere (10). According to the method of Chou
and Fasman (24), this Gly is located within a predicted ,8-turn
region. The probability of ,B-turn occurrence (P, value) at residues 147-150 is calculated to be 1.94 X 10-4 in the normal
sequence but is reduced to 1.08 X l0-4 by the Gly'50 to Arg
substitution. This region seems to be incorporated into the ahelix by the replacement, thereby altering the secondary structure of the T2 subunit. Thus it is highly probable that the single
amino acid change causes instability of the enzyme. On the
other hand, this mutation may also affect the enzyme activity.
Unfortunately, we failed to examine the possibility of expressing the mutant protein in cultured cells because all the cell lines
we tested contained relatively high endogenous activities of T2
and other thiolases, thereby interfering with an accurate measurement of the T2 activity derived from the transfected gene.
It is now well established that the 5' and 3' splice sites of
introns are composed of GT and AG dinucleotides, respectively. These are absolutely conserved and required for accurate splicing of nuclear pre-mRNA (25, 26). Mutations at the
GT dinucleotide of the 5' splice site have been reported to cause
skipping of the preceding exon (27-31). We concluded that the
substitution of GT dinucleotide for TT in the 5' splice site of
intron 8 caused the skipping of exon 8.
Mutations involving the consensus AG dinucleotide ofthe
3' splice site have been noted in three genetic diseases: f3-thalassemia (32, 33), citrullinemia (34), and lipoprotein lipase deficiency (35). In these cases, the mutations caused abnormal
splicing with the use of cryptic acceptor sites in the affected
intron (33) or in the following exon (34), or the affected intron
sequences were not spliced (32, 34). To our knowledge, there
478

Fukao et aL

has been no report of a human disease involving an entire exon
skipping caused by a mutation at the 3' splice site. However, an
AG to AA transition at the splice acceptor site of an intron was
reported to cause skipping of the following exon in a spontaneous mutant of Chinese hamster ovary cells deficient in dihydrofolate reductase activity (36). Similarly, it is highly probable
that the AG to CG mutation at the splice acceptor site of intron
11 in our patient (GK04) also affects the splicing of this intron.
Hence, we propose that this mutation in GKO4 and his mother
is the cause of exon 11 skipping detected in the cDNA analysis.
