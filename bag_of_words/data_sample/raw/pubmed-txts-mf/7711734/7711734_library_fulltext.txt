The identification of the BTK (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) gene defective In human Immunoglobulln deficiency
X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA) and characterisation of B7X exon intron boundaries has now allowed
the analysis of mutations and polymorphisms at the level of genomic DNA. Using Southern blot analysis and
the polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) assay, amplifying all
19 exons and the putative promoter region with a single annealllng temperature, mutations have been identified
in 19 out of 24 unrelated patients diagnosed as having XLA. Apart from a large deletion involving exon 19,
nine missense (F25S, R288W, I370M, M509V, R525P, N526K, R562W, A582V and G594R), two nonsense (E277X
and R525X), five frameshift and two splice site mutations have been found affecting most coding exons and
all major enzyme domains. No mutations or polymorphisms were detected in the putative promoter region. A
single nucleotlde deletion located in the last exon, resulting in a truncation of the eight C-termlnal residues
of Btk and a typical XLA phenotype, indicates structural and/or functional importance of Btk helix I In the
catalytic domain. Although allelic heterogeneity at the BTK locus may partly explain clinical variability In
families with XLA, compensatory and redundant mechanisms involved in B-cell development must play a role
in the phenotypic diversity of the disease.

INTRODUCTION
X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA; MIM 300300) is a rare
immunoglobulin deficiency (1) characterised by a B-lineagespecific differentiation defect resulting in a decreased level or
absence of mature B-cells and immunoglobulins. Affected
males suffer from recurrent bacterial infections starting typically in early childhood and require immunoglobulin replacement therapy (2).
The XLA locus was mapped to the region Xq21.3—q22 by
genetic linkage analysis (3,4). In a positional cloning strategy
involving direct cDNA selection, a gene was isolated which
mapped to the XLA locus, was expressed in B-cells and
showed deletions and point mutations in families with XLA
(5). This gene, now designated BTK (Bruton's tyrosine kinase),
was also identified in a search for B-cell-specific tyrosine
kinases and was found to exhibit deficient mRNA and protein
expression in XLA pre-B and B-cell lines (6). The BTK gene
encodes a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase with a significant
similarity to Tec (7,8), ltk/Tsk/Emt (9-11), Bmx (12) and Txk
(13). Apart from the N-terminal pleckstrin-homology (PH)

domain (14,15) and Tec-homology (TH) domain (16,17) with
yet unknown function(s), Btk contains Src-homology domain
3 (SH3), likely to bind to proline-rich stretches, SH2 domain
involved in phosphotyrosine interactions and the catalytic
kinase domain (SHI) (5,6).
The mouse BTK cDNA was shown to have a single amino
acid substitution in an immunodeficient (xid) strain CBA/N
and xid phenotype was mapped to the region homologous to
that of XLA (18,19). Further support that the deficient Btk
causes human XLA came from mutation studies analysing
cDNA in patients with the disease (20-25) and observing point
mutations, deletions and insertions in the coding region. The
elucidation of the genomic organisation of human and murine
BTK loci (26-28) has now made it possible to analyse mutations
and polymorphisms at the genomic level (26,27,29) and here
we report the results of such a DNA-based single strand
conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis (30) in the largest
European study so far comprising 24 unrelated patients with
XLA.

RESULTS
Detection of mutations using PCR-SSCP assay
The PCR primer pairs amplifying the putative promoter region
and exonic sequences with flanking introns are shown in
Table 1. The primer set was designed to allow all exons and
promoter region to be amplified in a single PCR set-up using
an annealling temperature (TJ of 57°C, although the optimal
Ta giving the highest yield of PCR products differ slightly
(Table 1). Exons 11 and 12 were amplified with a single primer
pair and the resulting PCR product of 435 bp was digested
using a restriction enzyme with a unique internal site (Table
1, see an example in Fig. 1). The amplified segments of BTK
were analysed in parallel on SSCP gels and mutation-containing
exons were cloned and sequenced (see examples in Fig. 2 a - 0 Mutations were identified in 19 out of 24 unrelated patients
with XLA included in the study. Apart from a larger deletion
involving exon 19 detected by Southern blot analysis, there
were nine missense (F25S, R288W, I370M, M509V, R525P,
N526K, R562W, A582V and G594R), two nonsense (E277X
and R525X), five frameshift (three single nucleotide deletions

and two single nucleotide insertions) and two splice site
mutations. The mutations are summarised in Table 2. Although
they were found in most BTK exons affecting all major
domains of the enzyme (Table 2), mutations or polymorphisms
were not detected in the putative TATA-less promoter region.
The amino acid substitutions in the BTK gene
The phenylalanine 25 to serine substitution resulting from T
to C transition in patient 10/41 (Table 2) occurs at the beginning
of P strand B of the PH domain, which is present in a number
of signalling and cytoskeletal proteins (31-33). The S25 is
close to R28, which was found to be replaced by cysteine in
the xid mouse (18,19) and by histidine in human XLA (21,27,
Vihinen et al., submitted). Both F25 and R28 may be essential
for binding of the PH domain to its target(s) (18,33-35).
The R288W substitution due to C to T transition in exon
10 (patient 11/37 in Table 2) is located at the beginning of
helix A in the Btk SH2 domain (36), a key site of phosphotyrosine binding, impairing the SH2 domain function. The age of
onset in this French patient was delayed compared to that
found in most patients with XLA (37), but the patient had less

previously in an unrelated Dutch patient with a 'leaky phenotype' and variable presentation of the disease in his family
members (20,21). Although our patient had a cousin with
XLA, no Dutch ancestors were traced in this pedigree.

Figure 1. PCR —SSCP analysis of exons 11 and 12 amplified from control
(lane 1) and patient's (23/3) DNA (lane 2) as a single 435 bp fragment. The
PCR product was digested with Hincll yielding two fragments of 236 bp
(exon 11) and 199 bp (exon 12). Only single stranded DNA corresponding to
236 bp fragment showed a band shift (closed circles). Nucleotide sequencing
of this segment amplified from patient 23/3 revealed deletion of guanine in
position of 1069/70 (5), creating a frameshift in the reading frame. Open
circles indicate single stranded DNA corresponding to 199 bp fragment (exon
12). A similar band shift of fragments representing exon 11, but not exon 12
(see legend to Table 1), was obtained with Kpn\ digested 435 bp PCR product

a loop between aB and pG (36). Although this residue cannot
be directly involved in phosphotyrosine peptide binding, the
mutation could prevent its recognition since the longer side
chain of M370 could clash with the backbone of the binding
residue R332 (36).
Methionine 509 in helix E (25) is a conserved residue in
protein-tyrosine kinases. This amino acid is located in the core
of the catalytic domain and is likely to be involved in stabilizing
the catalytic loop by interacting with leucine 522. The shorter
side chain resulting from M509V substitution (patient 19/10
in Table 2) cannot provide the necessary binding (Fig. 3).
Arginine 525 has been suggested to correspond to yphosphate binding K168 in cAPK (25). A consequence of its
change to another residue (patient 15/20 in Table 2 and Fig.
2b), perhaps excluding lysine, is the inability to interact
with ATP.
The asparagine 526 and its counterpart N171 in cyclic AMPdependent protein-kinase (25) is highly conserved in both
families of kinases. The residue binds to one of the Mg 2+ ions
and D521 (Fig. 3). The mutation N526K in patient 2/19 (Table
2, Figs 2a and 3) interferes with these functions. Invariant
D521 is essential for substrate binding (25).
Three other amino acid substitutions have been found in the
kinase domain: R562W, A582V and G594R. Arginine 562 and
alanine 582 interact with the side chain of the invariant W563
(25) and mutations of either of the surrounding residues
interfere with its interaction with the catalytic loop. It was
shown that site directed mutagenesis of W563 to F abolishes
kinase activity (38). The amino acid substitutions R562W and
A582V were found in patients with a delayed onset of the
disease. The G594R substitution, which was, on the other
hand, identified in a patient with typical XLA (age of onset 2
years and absent B cells) without any history of growth
disorder, affects a virtually invariant residue that lies on the
surface of the protein between helices aF and aG and might
be involved in substrate binding (25). These three residues

Human Molecular Genetics, 1995, Vol. 4, No. 1 55
not detected by screening of 30 unrelated individuals using
our PCR-SSCP analysis (not shown).
Splice site mutations in the BTK gene
The guanine residue at position +5 of 5' splice sites, which
was changed to adenine in patient 13/7 (Table 2 and Fig. 2f)
is the third most conserved nucleotide in this splice junction
consensus sequence with estimated nucleotide frequency of
0.84 (39). The replacement of the G residue in our patient
would be predicted to reduce the stability of base-pairing of
the 5' splice site with the 5' end of Ul small-nuclear RNA.
The spontaneous G to A transitions in this position have
been described so far in the genes for (J-thalassaemia (40),
osteogenesis imperfecta type II (41), haemophilia B (42),
acatalasaemia (43), Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (44), Tay-Sachs
disease (45) and protein C and S deficiencies (46,47), mostly
resulting in exon skipping. A recent case report showed a G
to A transition in position +5 of 5' splice site of BTK intron
17 in a patient with XLA associated with growth hormone
deficiency (48). Our patient had typical XLA (total absence
of B cells, IgA 0.08 g/1, IgG 0.22 g/1 and IgM 0.25 g/1 at
diagnosis) with no history of growth hormone deficiency.
The second splice site mutation found at position - 2 of the
3' splice site of intron 5 changes the invariant adenine to
cytosine in patient 14/39 (Table 2 and Fig. 2e). One such
transversion was found to result in skipping of exon 12 in
the mitochondrial acetoacetyl-coenzyme A thiolase (49). The
phenotypic consequences at the nucleotide level have not been
studied in the second of two such transversions reported so
far (50).
Truncation of the eight C-terminal residues of Btk results
in XLA
The single nucleotide deletion in exon 19 found in patient 6/26
truncates the last eight residues (652-659) and removes the
helix I of the Btk C-terminus (Table 2, Figs 2d and 3).
The mutation could loosen interactions in the C-terminus,
potentially leading to protease susceptibility or a decrease in
interactions with the other domains of Btk. The importance of
leucine 562 in the middle of the helix I is supported by
the recently reported helix I-breaking substitution L562P
associated with a typical disease (29).
Southern blot analysis of the patients with XLA
Southern blot analysis revealed an abnormal 2.3 kb Taq\
fragment in two patients (15/20 and 32/21), resulting from the
loss of Taql restriction site at position 174)4 of BTK cDNA (5)
due to alterations of codon 525. In addition, a single deletion
was identified as a missing 5 kb //mdlll fragment (not shown)
in a Czech patient with a typical XLA phenotype and found
to involve exon 19. Mutations in all three patients have also
been detected using PCR—SSCP assay as missing or aberrant
PCR products (not shown).
In a patient with a mild phenotype diagnosed as common
variable immune deficiency (CVID) and reported previously
(51) as having a deletion at the 3' end of the BTK gene, we
have determined that this deletion comprises exons 17, 18 and
19 (not shown). This finding is consistent with the length of the
truncated transcript being approximately 1.9 kb, as identified by
Northern blot analysis (51).

Polymorphisms in the BTK gene
Although the oligonucleotides were designed to prime close
to exon—intron boundaries in order to minimize detecting
intronic polymorphisms, one two-allele polymorphism (T to
C) was found at position - 2 9 of the 3' splice site of intron
14. The cytosine-containing alleles that were present in similar
frequency in both unaffected controls and XLA patients show
faster mobility on SSCP gels. Using SSCP analysis with
primers flanking exon 15 (Table 1), screening of 63 X
chromosomes in unrelated Scandinavian Caucasians gave an
estimate of maximum likelihood heterozygosity of 0.20 in this
locus, the frequency of cytosine-containing alleles being 0.11.
Our PCR-SSCP assay using primers flanking exon 18 also
detected the previously reported polymorphism at position
2031 (20,21) of BJTKCDNA (5), but the mutation in our patient
20/17 (Table 2) was revealed by a distinct pattern on SSCP
gels (not shown). Another polymorphic site located in the 3'
untranslated region at position 2228 of BTK cDNA (52) lies
downstream of the most 3' amplified segment and is not
detected by the primer pairs shown in Table 1.

DISCUSSION
Although not all patients with XLA phenotype have been
found to have a mutation in the BTK gene, a mutation was
identified and found likely to interfere with enzyme function
in 19 out of 24 XLA cases analysed (80%). The proportion of
patients in whom mutations were not found is comparable to
other mutation, studies (20,26,29). A limited sensitivity of
the PCR—SSCP assay, clinical variability of this immune
deficiency, in particular an overlapping phenotype with CVID
(27,51), and an existence of intronic/regulatory mutations may
provide an explanation.
Although we used SSCP conditions that were found to show
a high sensitivity when screening a number of different
mutations in the cystic fibrosis gene and recommended for an
initial mutation analysis of any gene (53), it is possible that
different conditions would be more sensitive in detecting a
base change in a particular segment of the gene (54).
Clinical variability has been reported to exist both between
and within the families with XLA (2,20,21,27,55-59). A
classical XLA phenotype was described, together with a milder
form of immunodeficiency in sibs (55,57), nephews (56,57)
or more distant relatives (58,59). In a screening of a set of
male patients referred with diagnosis of CVID using Southern
blot analysis with BTK cDNA as a probe, one patient was
found with a BTK deletion (51). This case was the first
molecular evidence that a defect in the BTK gene can be
associated with a milder immunodeficiency and distinct clinical
diagnosis. Since then, more patients referred with a diagnosis
of CVID have been analysed and mutations in the BTK gene
reported (27 and H.D.Ochs, personal communication).
The phenotypes of most patients included in our study were
typical of XLA with less than \% of B cells; only one patient
had 2% CD 19+ cells (14/39 in Table 2). It is possible that in
this patient the underlying mutation in invariant adenine at
position - 2 of the 3' splice site of intron 5 leads to both
aberrant and normal mRNA species compensating the defect,
but we could not study its phenotypic impact on mRNA
because patients' RNA samples were not available to us.

Although a locus heterogeneity could not yet be excluded,
cDNA clones isolated from the region surrounding the BTK
gene in Xq21.3-q22 have not been found to give an altered
pattern in Southern blot analyses in a limited set of patients
with isolated XLA (60). Genetic heterogeneity may also exist
in CVID with thus far unidentified autosomal defect(s) and
contribute to the clinical variability and overlap with XLA
phenotype. This hypothesis would be consistent with occasional
findings of females with a disorder phenotypically identical to
typical XLA (61,62). However, three patients with family
history of XLA out of five patients in whom mutation was not
found in this study might point to a limited sensitivity of
mutation assay or existence of regulatory regions at a site
not screened by PCR-SSCP analysis rather than genetic
heterogeneity.
In summary, a rapid and convenient PCR-SSCP method
was introduced for molecular diagnosis, mutation screening
and carrier status determination in the families with XLA and
candidate phenotypes, allowing the identification of mutations
in the majority of XLA patients within a day if their RNA/
cDNA samples are not available. Mutation patterns of the BTK
gene in a set of 19 unrelated patients were characterised and
structural implications of Btk defects due to predicted amino
acid substitutions were analysed based on previous computeraided modelling of Btk domains.

PCR products were separated using 2% agarose gels in 1 XTBE. DNA was
purified using GeneClean (BIO 101) and subcloned into pCR-Script (SK+)
vectors according to manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene). At least
two insert-containing clones per patient were sequenced (64) in both directions
using a Sequenase 2.0 sequencing kit (USB).
Southern blot analysis
DNA was digested with Taq\ and W/ndlll restriction enzymes, fragments were
separated by eleclrophoresis in a 0.9% agarose gel and blotted onto Hybond
N membranes (Amersham). 32P-labelled probes were prepared using random
hexamer priming of BTKcDNA clone 14-6(5). Prehybridisation, hybridisation,
washing and autoradiography were as described previously (60).

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Patients
Twenty-four unrelated French and Czech patients were included in the study.
They were all males, aged between 2 and 23 years and diagnosed as having
XLA. Diagnosis was based on the absence or very low levels of circulating
B cells, low levels of immunoglobulins and susceptibility to infections early
in childhood. The age of onset of infections varied between 1 and 16 years.
Eleven patients had a history of a male family member affected with XLA,
but the putative earners have not been available for analysis.
DNA preparation
DNA was prepared from peripheral blood cells using methods described
previously (63).
PCR amplification
The segments of the BTK gene were amplified from genomic DNA using a
set of primer pairs flanking all exons and the putative promoter region based
on the sequence as in (28) The exons were numbered as in ref. 26 and 27.
The primer sequences, optimal annealling temperatures and sizes of the PCR
products are shown in Table 1. The oligonucleotides were designed using the
computer programme Oligo, version 4.05 (National Biosciences, Inc.) to allow
amplification of all BTK segments from a patient using an annealling
temperature of 57°C in a single PCR. The PCR reaction volume was 20 \i\
and contained 100 ng DNA, 0.25 nJM of each primer, 100 nM of each dNTP,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KC1, 0.01% gelatin, 0.2
HCi [a-"P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and 0.5 U Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer).
The initial denaturation was for 4 min at 94°C. Amplification was for 32
cycles at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 57°C for 45 s and extension at 72°C for
30 s in a Perkin-Elmer thermocycler (system 9600).
SSCP analysis
The samples were mixed with 95% formamide, 0.05% bromophenol blue,
0.05% xylene cyanol, 50 mM NaOH, denatured at 95°C for 10 min and
loaded onto 0.4 mm/30 cm/45 cm 5% polyacrylamide—10% glycerol gels
(crosslinking 2.5%). The electrophoresis was conducted at 5 W at room
temperature overnight. The gels were dried and autoradiographed for 1-2
days at -70°C.
Cloning and sequencing of mutation-containing exons
BTK segments identified to contain polymorphisms/mutations were re-amplified using the same conditions except for omission of labelled dCTP. The
