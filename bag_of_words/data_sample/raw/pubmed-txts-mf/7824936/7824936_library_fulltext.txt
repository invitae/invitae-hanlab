Multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B (MEN2A and MEN2B) and familial medullary
thyroid carcinoma are dominantly inherited cancer syndromes. All three syndromes are
associated with mutations in RET, which encodes a receptor-like tyrosine kinase. The
altered RET alleles were shown to be transforming genes in NIH 3T3 cells as a consequence of constitutive activation of the RET kinase. The MEN2A mutation resulted in RET
dimerization at steady state, whereas the MEN2B mutation altered RET catalytic properties both quantitatively and qualitatively. Oncogenic conversion of RET in these neoplastic syndromes establishes germline transmission of dominant transforming genes in
human cancer.

MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary
thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) are dominantly
inherited cancer syndromes. MEN2A is defined by the presence of medullary thyroid
carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism. In addition to these abnormalities, MEN2B is characterized by skeletal abnormalities, ganglioneuromas of the
intestinal tract, and mucosal neuromas. All
three syndromes are associated with germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene
(1, 2), which codes for a receptor-like tyrosine kinase (3) whose ligand has not yet
been identified. In the case of MEN2A and
FMTC, point mutations result in the substitution of one of five Cys residues in the
extracellular domain of RET (1). In
MEN2B, a T-*C transition in the tyrosine
kinase domain causes a Met->Thr substitution at position 918 (2). It is not known
how these alterations contribute to neoplasia. In the simplest model, the mutated RET
allele acts as a dominant transforming gene.
Alternatively, the mutations may inactivate
a possible tumor suppressor function of
proto-RET. In this scenario, the reduced
dosage of proto-RET might be sufficient to

trigger transformation or the product of the
mutated allele might inhibit the function of
the wild-type protein, thus exerting a dominant negative function (4).
To test these possibilities, we engineered
eukaryotic expression vectors (5) encoding
proto-RET (LTR-ret), three different
MEN2A alleles (RET Cys634->Tyr, Arg, or
Trp; MEN2AY, MEN2AR, and MEN2AW,
respectively), and the MEN2B allele (RET
Met918--Thr; MEN2B). After transfection
in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, RET mutants, but
not proto-RET, displayed high transforming
efficiency (Fig. 1). In addition, MEN2A
and MEN2B transfectants displayed high
clonogenic ability in soft agar, whereas
proto-RET transfectants did not show
growth (6).
Mass populations of transfectants were
obtained by killer HAT selection and used
for protein analysis. RET was detected in
two forms, one --145 kD and the other

-160 kD (Fig. 2A), in all of the transfectants (7). Comparable amounts of RET
were then immunoprecipitated from the
various transfectants and assayed for phosphotyrosine (pTyr) content (8), a hallmark
of receptor autophosphorylation and activation. No tyrosine phosphorylation of the
proto-RET product was detectable, whereas
RET-MEN2A and RET-MEN2B products
showed high amounts of pTyr (Fig. 2A).
Similar results were obtained in immunocomplex kinase assays (9). The proto-RET
product displayed little, if any, kinase activity, whereas RET-MEN2A and RETMEN2B became autophosphorylated (Fig.
2B). Autophosphorylation of RET-MEN2B
was consistently one-third to one-fifth that
of the RET-MEN2A forms in both assays
(Fig. 2, A and B).
We analyzed a medullary thyroid carcinoma cell line, TT (10), by the reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and by nucleotide sequencing
and found that it expressed both a wild-type
and a mutated RET allele (Cys634--Trp)
(11). This cell line allowed us to validate
our observations with NIH 3T3 cells in a
setting representative of a naturally occurring neoplasm. For comparison, we used the
neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE (10),
which expresses only wild-type RET (11).
In TT cells, RET displayed detectable pTyr
amounts, whereas no pTyr was detectable in
RET expressed by SK-N-BE cells (Fig. 2C).
Similarly, RET from TT cells, but not from
SK-N-BE cells, displayed autophosphorylation activity in vitro (Fig. 2D).
To investigate the mechanism of activation of the mutated RET alleles, we analyzed RET-MEN2A and RET-MEN2B by
nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Under these
conditions, RET-MEN2B migrated as monomeric forms at --150 to 160 kD, whereas
RET-MEN2A displayed an additional species at -300 kD (Fig. 3A), consistent with

MEN2A. Thus, the clinical differences between the two syndromes cannot be
explained by an increased transforming
ability of RET-MEN2B. We therefore tested the possibility that the MEN2B mutation alters the substrate specificity of RET.
We first obtained maps of pTyr-containing
tryptic peptides for RET-MEN2A and RETMEN2B after autophosphorylation in vitro
(Fig. 4A) (16). The RET-MEN2A map
matched that obtained with an EGFR-RET
chimera (14), which represents the closest
"physiological" control of RET autophosphorylation in the absence of a RET ligand
(Fig. 4A). RET-MEN2B displayed a different phosphopeptide map, indicating alterFig. 3. (A) Comparable amounts of

ations in its autocatalytic specificity (Fig.
4A). We then studied the two-dimensional
electrophoretic pattern of RET-MEN2A
and RET-MEN2B substrates in NIH 3T3
transfectants (17). Although there was similarity of substrate phosphorylation, several
spots appeared differentially phosphorylated
in RET-MEN2B and RET-MEN2A transfectants (Fig. 4B). These results show that
the MEN2B mutation alters the substrate
specificity of RET. We propose that the
nature and availability of substrates in different cell types control RET activity at a
postreceptor level, resulting, in the case of
MEN2B, in an organ-specific growth advantage. This model is consistent with our

the size of disulfide-linked homodimers.
RET dimers were present in all of the
MEN2A transfectants (Fig. 3B). In addition, the dimer contained at least 10 times
more pTyr in vivo than the monomer (Fig.
3B), indicating that it is the form with
constitutive kinase activity. We postulate
that the Cys residues, disrupted by the
MEN2A mutations, are normally involved
in intramolecular disulfide bonds. The mutations may render the partner Cys available for aberrant disulfide bonding with
other mutant RET molecules and thus create active homodimers. Such a mechanism
has been described for in vitro mutagenized
erythropoietin receptor and epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) (12).
In the case of RET-MEN2B, we did not
detect RET dimers (Fig. 3A). To verify this,
we performed in vivo cross-linking (13)
experiments on MEN2B transfectants with
1 -(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). Under conditions in which other receptor homodimers, such as RET-MEN2A, EGFR,
and an EGFR-RET chimera (14) were
cross-linked, no RET-MEN2B dimers were
detectable (15), suggesting that RETMEN2B is activated by an intramolecular
mechanism.
MEN2B is a clinically more complex
and aggressive disease than MEN2A. However, the RET-MEN2B protein did not display increased kinase activity or transforming ability, as compared with RET-

higher amounts of transcripts (approximately threeto fivefold higher amounts of RET-specific mRNA in
MEN2A and MEN2B transfectants, as compared
with proto-RET transfectants) and in part to the increased half-life of the RET-MEN2A protein, as compared with RET-MEN2B (6 versus 3.5 hours, respectively) (M. Santoro and P. P. Di Fiore, unpublished

data).
9. The immunocomplex kinase assay was performed
as in (16). Wild-type and mutant RETs were immunoprecipitated with the antibody to RET (14). The
final kinase mixture contained 0.1 % Triton X-1 00, 20
mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCI, 15 mM MgCI2,
15 mM MnCI2, and 20 ,Ci of y-32P-labeled adenosine triphosphate (3000 Ci/mmol). In the expenment
shown, the reaction was for 20 min at room temperature. Similar results were obtained under initial conditions (1 min at 4°C).

5. We assembled the open reading frame (ORF) of
proto-RET by starting from clones derived from an
SK-N-BE complementary DNA (cDNA) library (corresponding to the extracellular portion of RET) and a
fragment of a described EGFR-RET construct (14),
corresponding to the intracellular portion of RET. We
completely sequenced the resulting cDNA, which
encodes the short isoform of the RET protein (3), on
both strands and found it to match exactly the published sequence of wild-type RET (3). The proto-RET
ORF was then cloned in the LTR-2 plasmid (18) to
yield the LTR-ret eukaryotic expression vector. Using
the RT-PCR, we cloned cDNA fragments with the
desired mutations from RNA obtained from neoplastic tissues of individuals with MEN2A and MEN2B.
Nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed that no other mutations were present in the cDNA fragments.
For the MEN2A expression vectors, Nde l-Eco RI
fragments [corresponding to positions 1717 to 2348
of the proto-RET sequence (3)] from the mutated
cDNAs were individually substituted for the analogous fragment in LTR-ret. For the MEN2B expression vector, a Bgl Il-Bcl fragment (positions 2765 to
2972 of proto-RE7) was substituted for the analogous fragment in LTR-ret. A second cycle of sequence analysis confirmed the introduction of the
expected mutations. Because all of the mutations
were introduced directly into the LTR-ret vector, all
constructs were identical except for the specified
mutations, thus allowing comparison of their transforming abilities.

The x-ray crystal structure of the complex between human growth hormone (hGH) and
the extracellular domain of its first bound receptor (hGHbp) shows that about 30 side
chains from each protein make contact. Individual replacement of contact residues in the
hGHbp with alanine showed that a central hydrophobic region, dominated by two tryptophan residues, accounts for more than three-quarters of the binding free energy. This
"functional epitope" is surrounded by less important contact residues that are generally
hydrophilic and partially hydrated, so that the interface resembles a cross section through
a globular protein. The functionally important residues on the hGHbp directly contact
those on hGH. Thus, only a small and complementary set of contact residues maintains
binding affinity, a property that may be general to protein-protein interfaces.

Specific protein-protein interactions are
critical events in most biological processes.
A number of crystallographic studies have
shown that the binding interfaces between
proteins are generally large (600 to 1300 A2)
and include many intermolecular contacts,
involving 10 to 30 side chains from each
protein (1-3). However, structural analysis
alone cannot show whether all of these contacts are important for tight binding. A complete understanding of the chemistry of protein-protein association also requires a functional map of each binding surface, to reveal
to what extent each contact contributes to
the overall free energy of binding.
The initial event in signaling through the
hGH receptor is the binding of the extracellular domain (hGHbp) to site 1 of hGH to
form a high-affinity 1:1 complex (dissociation constant, Kd, of 0.3 nM, corresponding
to a binding free energy, AG, of -12.3 kcal/
mol) (4, 5). The crystal structure of this

complex (3, 6) shows that on each protein a
surface area of about 1300 A2 becomes buried (defined by calculated inaccessibility to
solvent) (7), including 33 side chains on the
receptor (Fig. 1A). We mutated each of
these side chains individually to alanine,
except for G168 and the C108-C122 disulfide (8). Substitution by alanine deletes all
interactions made by atoms beyond the P
carbon and should reveal the contribution to
binding energy made by the removed portion
of the side chain (9). Each mutant hGHbp
was expressed in Escherichia col, purified to
>90% homogeneity, and assayed for hGH
binding affinity (10, 1 1 ).
Fewer than half of the mutations caused
substantial loss in binding affinity (Fig. 1B).
By far the greatest reductions in affinity
(>4.5 kcal/mol) occurred on substituting
two tryptophan residues, W104 and W169
(12). Large effects (1.5 to 3.5 kcal/mol) were
also seen for alanine substitutions at other
hydrophobic residues (1103, 1105, P106, and
1165), and generally smaller effects (1 to 2

kcal/mol)

were seen for some charged residues (R43, E44, D126, E127, and D164).
This subset of 11 contact residues, which we
term the functional epitope, maps to a con-

observation that the mitogenic potency of
RET varies in different target cells (14).
These data establish that mutations in
MEN2A and MEN2B convert RET into a
dominant transforming gene. They also
show the underlying mechanism to be a
dominant oncogenic conversion rather
than a loss of suppressor function. This
finding is based on the observations that
MEN2A and MEN2B mutations concomitantly activate the intrinsic kinase and
transforming ability of RET and that mutant RET is enzymatically activated in the
presence of a coexpressed normal allele as
was shown in TT cells. Thus, the oncogenic
conversion of RET illustrates that a dominant transforming gene can have a causal
role in human hereditary neoplasia. In addition, our identification of the molecular
mechanisms of RET activation provides the
basis for therapeutic strategies in MEN2A,
MEN2B, and FMTC.
