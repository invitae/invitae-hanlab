Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder
characterized by a severe generalized exocrinopathy. The coding
regions of the responsible gene, named CFTR, have been cloned
and sequenced (1, 2).
In the CFTR gene more than 300 different mutations, including
missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations, have been so far
identified (CF Genetic Analysis Consortium, personal
communication), the most common being a deletion of a
phenylalanine residue at position 508 of the first Nucleotide
Binding Fold (NBF1) (3). In molecular screening for CF defects
in Sardinians, carried out by DGGE analysis of exons
4 - 7 - 1 0 - 1 1 - 1 4 a - 1 5 - 1 7 b - 2 0 - 2 1 , we identified two novel
mutations: a C - T transversionat nt 1145 (T338I) and a C—A
transversion at nt 2867 (S912X). The C—T transversion produces
a missense mutation Thr—lie at amino acid 338 in exon 7, which
codes for the first transmembrane domain. The C—A
transversion leads to a nonsense mutation Ser—Stop at amino
acid 912 in exon 15, which codes for the second transmembrane
domain.
The characterization of the above mutations was obtained by
DGGE analysis on amplified DNA (4). The DNA was amplified
with primers CF7 and GCCF7 for exon 7 and primers CF15 and
GCCF15 for exon 15 (see Fanen et al., 1992, for details). The
PCR products were separated on denaturing gradient
poly aery lamide gel. The abnormal electrophoretic pattern
produced by the two mutations is shown in Figures 1 and 2.
The mutations in exon 7 and 15 were characterized by direct
sequencing of asymmetric PCR products using dideoxynucleotide
chain termination method (5, 6) (Figures 1 and 2).
The T338I mutation was found in four unrelated CF patients,
of whom two had on the other chromosome the AF508 mutation
and two an unknown mutation. The analysis of two extragenic
markers (XV-2c and KM 19) revealed that all four T338I alleles
carried the same haplotype B (KM19/PstI = 2; XV2c/TaqI =
1) (7). All patients with the T338I mutation were pancreatic
sufficient (PS). Meconhim ileus was not reported in any of them.
In the two patients with the T338I/AF508 compound
heterozygosity, the disease manifested at 6 months of age with
hyponatremia, hypochloremia and metabolic alkalosis, and at 2
years of age with failure to thrive and poor weight gain
respectively. The two patients compound heterozygotes for
T338I/unknown mutation are adults suffering only from recurrent
bronchopulmonary infections.
It could be interesting to note that in exon 7 several missense
mutations have already been described as carrying a mild
phenotype (8—10). However, the small number of cases studied

and the early presentation of two of them do not allow us to make
any firm conclusion about phenotype—genotype correlation.
Up to now several missense mutations located in the
hydrophobic transmembrane domains have been described, many
of them being amino acid substitutions involving a polar residue.
Likewise, in the T338I mutation the encoded amino acid switched
from apolar to polar (Thr—-De), presumably producing an
alteration of the pore of the channel formed by the transmembrane
segment.
The S912X mutation was found in a single case showing a
severe phenotype with pancreatic insufficiency and recurrent
respiratory infections. The patient was compound heterozygote
for the S912X and an unknown mutation. The S912X mutation
may lead to premature termination of the protein production in
the second transmembrane domain.
It should be noted that in all five patients examined in this study
by DGGE analysis, no other mutations have been found in the
10 exons considered so far. By adding these new mutations, the
percentage of CF mutations so far characterized in Sardinians
rises to 84% out of 86 CF chromosomes.
