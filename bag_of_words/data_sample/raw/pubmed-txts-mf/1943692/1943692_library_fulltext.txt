Summary. Deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase causes arginine auxotrophy in lower organisms and

causes citrullinemia in humans and cattle. Previously, seven missense mutations, four mutations
associated with an absence of an exon in mRNA, and one splicing mutation have been identified in
human neonatal citrullinemia. Reverse transcription of mRNA, amplification of cDNA and sequencing of
cDNA clones were used to identify two additional missense mutations causing citrullinemia. One
mutation involves substitution of leucine for serine at position 18 (S18L) and the other a substitution of
cysteine for arginine at position 86 (R86C). Both of these mutations represent C ---+ T transitions in CpG
dinucleotides, and eight of nine missense mutations causing human citrullinemia involve similar
transitions in CpG dinucleotides. The nucleotide coding sequence and deduced amino acid analysis are
available for four mammalian species, yeast and three bacterial species. Six of nine missense mutations in
humans occur in amino acid positions that are completely conserved in these organisms. Mutations
causing human citrullinemia are extremely heterogeneous, and all non-consanguineous individuals
studied to date are compound heterozygotes.

by a complete or nearly complete deficiency of arginino succinate synthetase activity (Brusilow & Horwich,
1989; Harper et al., 1986). Classic neonatal citrullinemia in humans is characterized by > 100-fold
increased levels of blood citrulline, hyperammonemia,
mental retardation and early death unless treated
(Brusilow & Horwich, 1989; Beaudet et al., 1986).
Enzyme activity is expressed in cultured human fibroblasts, and early work demonstrated an absence of
cross-reacting immune material, but the presence of
near normal levels of mRNA in most cell lines (Su et
al., 1982). Nuclease protection studies indicated considerable heterogeneity among cell lines, with
evidence for defects larger than single base changes in
mRNA associated with some mutant alleles (Su et al.,
1983). More recent studies (Jackson et ai., 1989;
Kobayashi et al., 1990; Su & Lin, 1990) have identified' seven single base missense mutations causing
citrullinemia and five other mutations associated with
large deletions in the mRNA. These deletions
included the absence of a single exon sequence from
cDNA clones of four alleles (exon 5, 6, 7 or 13).
Deletions of genomic DNA were found in the two
mutations without exon 5 or6 in the mRNA, but
normal Southern blots were found for the two associated with the absence of exon 7 or 13. One mutation
resulting in the absence of the first seven base-pairs of

Introduction
Argininosuccinate synthetase (EC 6.3.4.5) catalyses
the conversion of citrulline, aspartate and ATP into
argininosuccinate, AMP and pyrophosphate. In
lower organisms, the enzyme functions in the
pathway for biosynthesis of arginine. In ureotelic
animals such as man, the enzyme is expressed at high
levels in the liver where it functions as part of the urea
cycle. The human enzyme is a cytoplasmic homotetramer with a subunit molecular weight of 46,400.
The nucleotide coding sequence and deduced amino
acid sequence for the enzyme are known for humans
(Bock et al., 1983), rat (Surh et al., 1988), mouse (Surh
et al., 1991), cow (Dennis et al., 1989), Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (Van Vliet et al., 1990), Escherichia coli
(Van Vliet et al., 1990), and two archaebacteria
(Morris & Reeve, 1988).
Deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase in lower
organisms causes a nutritional requirement for arginine. In humans and cattle, citrullinemia has been
identified as, an autosomal recessive disorder caused

exon 16 in the cDNA sequence was caused by a G to
C substitution in the last base of intron 15, resulting
in splicing to a cryptic site within exon 16. Bovine
citrullinemia is caused by a nonsense mutation in
codon 86 (Dennis et al., 1989). In this paper, we
present the characterization of two additional
missense mutations causing neonatal human citrullinemia. The sites of missense mutations are compared
with the amino acid sequences for the enzyme from
bacteria to mammals.

Smith & Smith, 1990). Restriction endonuclease
digestions were carried out according to the supplier's
recommendations. Procedures for gel electrophoresis,
ligation reactions, recovery of DNA fragments and
other methods were performed as described

Materials and methods
GENERAL METHODS

The cell lines used in this study were made available to our laboratory from other centers for the
confirmation of the diagnosis of citrullinemia. RNA
was isolated as described by Chomczynski & Sacchi
(1987). Methods for the synthesis of cDNA and for
the amplification and cloning of the products have
been described (Jackson et al., 1989; Kobayashi et al.,
1990). Oligonucleotides SF and TB (Kobayashi et al.,
1990) were employed to amplify the entire coding
region of the argininosuccinate synthetase mRNA.
The amplified DNA was digested with BamHI and
Pst! and ligated into M13mp18 or M13mp19 as
desired. Additional oligonucleotides used in these
analyses are given in Figure 1. DNA sequencing was
performed on the Applied Biosystems model 370A
DNA sequencer. Computer analysis was performed
using the facilities of the Molecular Biology

Enzyme assays were performed as described (Su et
al., 1982). For routine assays, the concentrations of
substrates were 5·7 mM-citrulline, 1 mM-aspartate and
1 mM-A TP. For the determination of the Km values
for citrulline, the concentrations of citrulline were
varied from 0·25 mM to 130 mM, with the concentration of the other substrates fixed at 1 mM-aspartate
and 1 mM-ATP.
Results

First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse
transcription of RNA from cultured skin fibroblasts
of cell lines GM63 and MR. The single-stranded
cDNA containing the entire coding region was amplified using the oligonucleotides SF and TB as
described (Jackson et al., 1989; Kobayashi et al.,
1990). Cell line GM63 was known to contain two
mRNA species by virtue of Sl nuclease analysis (Su et
al., 1983), and one of the alleles has a deletion of exon
5 and produces a smaller product in the amplification
reaction (Jackson et al., 1989). For this analysis we
isolated clones that did not have deletion of the
sequences contained within exon 5. Cell line MR had
not been previously studied.

codon as + 1.

Four clones from each cell line were sequenced. All
four clones from cell line GM63 were found to
'contain a single base change (C -+ T) at base-pair 256
(data not shown). This mutation resulted in the
substitution of cysteine (TGC) for arginine (CGC) in
codon 86 (R86C). The presence of the C -+ T change
at 256 bpt in cell line GM63 results in the loss of an
AvaIl restriction site. To confirm the presence of this
mutation, an independent amplification was performed using the SF and E13B oligonucleotides

FIGURE 2. Confirmation of the R86C mutation in GM63. The cDNA from GM63 (GM) and from a normal cell line (N) was
amplified using the SF and E13B primers (Fig. 1). The positions of AvaIl sites are indicated by arrows with the sizes of
restriction fragments indicated (in bp). Allele 1 indicates the expected results for the R86C mutation and Allele 2 indicates
the expected results for the deletion of ex on 5. PCR products were digested ( + ) or not ( - ) with AvaIl. The 292 and 123 bp
fragments are absent in GM63 and a 415 bp fragment is present. The 226 bp fragment co migrates with the 217 bp fragment.
M indicates DNA markers (in bp).
(Fig. 1). These primers produce a 1021 bp product.
The loss of the AvaIl site is predicted to result in the
loss of the 292 bp and 123 bp fragments and the
creation of a new 415 bp product (Fig. 2). The other
allele in cell line GM63 has no ex on 5 sequences and
results in a 226 bp fragment for this region. Following
digestion with AvaIl, the products are consistent with
the absence of exon 5 sequences in one allele and with
the loss of the AvaIl site in the other allele.
In our previous work, we identified four single-base
missense mutations that resulted in the loss of
different Mspl sites in the amplified DNA. All of
these mutations (R304W, G324S, R363W, G390R)
are within the 3' half of the eDNA. This information
allowed us to screen cell lines for the presence of these
mutations prior to sequencing the amplified products.
To perform such an analysis, we amplified a 639 bp
fragment spanning this region using oligonucleotides
E13F and TB-2. Digestion of the amplified DNA

from cell line MR indicated the presence of the
G390R mutation in one allele in this cell line. In order
to identify the remaining mutation in this cell line,
full-length
amplified
DNA
was
sequenced.
Automated DNA sequencing revealed a single base
change (C --t T) in patient MR at base-pair 53 (Fig. 3).
This resulted in substitution of leucine (TTG) for
serine (TCG) in codon 18 (S18L). This mutation also
resu~ted in the loss of an MnlI restriction enzyme site
(CCTq in exon 3. The presence of this mutation was
confirmed by demonstrating the loss of the MnlI site
in DNA prepared from an independent amplification
reaction using oligonucleotides E3F and MB
(Kobayashi et ai., 1990) (data not shown).

Mellman, 1967}. We confirmed and extended the data
available regarding the kinetic properties of arginino·
succinate synthetase in cell line GM63. This cell line
showed no detectable activity of argininosuccinate
synthetase by our usual assay method. However,
when the concentration of citrulline was increased,
the argininosuccinate synthetase activity was detect·
able in this cell line, but the Vmax was still low, and a
significant alteration in the Km for citrulline wa
noted (Table 1).
Discussion

Fourteen mutations have been identified in the
argininosuccinate synthetase gene in cell lines derived
from patients with neonatal citrullinemia, and one

mutation was found as the cause of citrullinemia in
cattle. Ten of these mutations involve single base
changes in the coding sequence for the enzyme, four
involve the absence of an exon in the mRNA, and one
causes abnormal splicing. Eight of nine single base
mutations observed in the human argininosuccinate
synthetase gene involve a C ~ T transition in a CpG
dinucleotide, and the single mutation observed in
cattle also involves such a transition. Of the 14
patients we have studied, all have been shown to be
compound heterozygotes, with the exception of two
patients that were born from consanguineous
matings.
Since most of the cell lines studied are known to be
compound heterozygotes, it is difficult to draw
conclusions regarding the effect of the mutations on
the kinetic parameters of the mutant protein. In the
case of GM63, one allele has a deletion of exon 5, and
it might be assumed that any protein product derived
from this allele is completely inactive and perhaps
rapidly degraded. If such were the case, the only
contribution to the activity observed in this cell line
would be that derived from the allele with the R86C
mutation. Interestingly, this mutation involves an
amino acid position that is not conserved between
species, and substitution at a non·conserved site

might be more likely to result in residual enzyme
activity. The kinetic data are consistent with the lack
of detectable enzyme activity in extracts under
normal assay conditions and with the presence of
detectable incorporation of [14C]citrulline by intact
cells of line GM63 (Su et al., 1982).
The deduced amino acid sequence for argininosuccinate synthetase from eight species is currently available. These include human (Bock et al., 1983;
Kobayashi et al., 1990), rat (Surh et al., 1988), mouse

(Surh' et al., 1991), cow (Dennis et al., 1989),
Methanococcus vannielii (Morris & Reeve, 1988),
Methanosarcina barkeri MS (Morris & Reeve, 1988),
E. coli (Van Vliet et al., 1990) and S. cerevisiae (Van
Vliet et al., 1990). The human, rat, murine and bovine
protein sequences are at least 93% identical, and a
comparison of these sequences provides little insight
into critical residues within the sequence. In contrast,
a comparison of the more highly diverged sequences
provides a much clearer picture of amino acid

residues that are critical to the function of the
enzyme. Such a comparison is provided in Figure 4.
The comparison in Figure 4 reveals two regions
from human residues 10 to 18 and 118 to 129 that are
highly conserved in all species. Although there are no
other large sites of significant conservation, there are
numerous single amino· acid residues throughout the
protein that are conserved among these highly
diverged organisms. Of the nine amino acid residues
involved in missense mutations, six alter residues that
are completely conserved among these species. It is
not known which amino acid residues are essential
for the binding of the amino acid substrates by the
enzyme. There is evidence that specific arginine
residues are involved in the binding of ATP and PPi .
Chemical modification studies indicated that arginine
residues 153 and/or 157 were involved in the binding
of ATP (Isashiki et al., 1989). We reported a
mutation, R157H, that affected one of these arginine
residues (Kobayashi et al., 1990), and this residue is
conserved among the species whereas arginine 153 is
not conserved.
