Protein S Deficiency Type I: Identification of Point Mutations
in 9 of l 0 Families
By Stefan Mustafa, Ingrid Pabinger, and Christine Mannhalter
We identified potentially causative mutations in the active
protein S gene (PROS 1) by direct sequencing of PROS 1specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of all 15
exons, including exon-intron boundaries in 10 families with
hereditary protein S deficiency type 1. Seven different mutations were found in 9 of 10 families, including one frame
shift mutation, a previously published splice site mutation
(both occurring in two unrelated families), fourmissense
mutations, and a stop codon at the beginning of exon 12.
In family studies, cosegregation of the mutation with the
disease could be demonstrated for five mutations; for two

ROTEIN C and its cofactor, protein S, play an important
role in the anticoagulant system."' Protein C, a vitamin
K-dependent glycoprotein, is activated by the thrombinthrombomodulin complex to activated protein C (APC),
which, in the presence of its cofactor, protein S, selectively
inhibits the procoagulant cofactors factor VIIIa and factor
Va, thereby downregulating the coagulation cascade.' Protein S, also a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein, is synthesized in the liver: endothelial cells,s and a number of other
tissues. Its mRNA is also found in platelets.6Protein S circulates in plasma in part as complex (60%)with C4b-binding
protein (C4BP) and in part as unbound, free form (40%).7
It has been shown that only free protein S is functionally
active in the protein C anticoagulant pathway.'
The concentration of protein S in plasma is usually determined by measurements of antigen (free or total protein
S) and/or activity. Most cases of protein S-deficiency are
classified as type I deficiency with reduced levels of antigen
and activity.' Few reports describe cases of type I1 (normal
total and free antigen, reduced activity)'0,'' and type 111 (normal total antigen, reduced free antigen and activity)I2defects
(type attribution according to SSC Subcommittee Meeting,
Munich, Germany, 1993).
Homozygous protein C or protein S deficiency can lead
to life-threatening thrombotic complications shortly after
birth.I3 Heterozygous individuals have a significant risk to
develop venous thrombosis, but at a later age and usually

missense mutations, this was not possible due to limited
family data. All seven mutations were theonly abnormalities
identified in the respective index patients and were absent
in 44 to 62 normal individuals. Therefore, they most likely
represent the causal gene defects. Forfive mutations, analysis of ectopic RNA could be performed. Mutant transcripts
were present in thecase of the frame shift and three of the
missense mutations, while no mutant RNA could be detected in the case of the stop codon.

heterozygous protein S-deficient individuals. All test systems
show a considerable overlap between proteinS plasma levels
found in normal individuals and in deficient heterozygotes.
Especially in the case of oral anticoagulation, the diagnostic
uncertainty withconventional test systems is very high. Only
a genetic approach that identifies the causative mutations in
protein S-deficient individuals can bypass these diagnostic
pitfalls.
Protein S is encoded by the active PROS 1 gene on chromosome 3, and an inactive pseudogene, PROS 2, also exists
on chromosome 3.lh.I7 PROS 2, whichis not transcribed,
shows a homology of 97% with PROS 1, but differs by the
absence of exon 1 and thepresence of stop codons within the
gene."-'" It can be expected that mutations causing protein S
defects willbe located withinthePROS 1 gene. To date,
two major deletions2'.'' and 21 point mutations".23-2h
in the
PROS 1 gene have been reported as putatively causal mutations in protein S deficiency. Analysis of PROS 1 mRNA
was shown to be unsatisfactory to search for mutations in
protein S-deficient families, as gene defects interfering with
mRNA synthesis and/or processing remainedundetected.'
In contrast, the screening of the 15 individual exons and the
exonhntron boundaries of the PROS 1 gene allows identification of all genomic mutations in the coding region and the
splice junction sites.
Using this approach, we identified mutations in 9 of I O
individuals with protein S deficiency. The nine individuals
shared seven different mutations; two mutations occurred in
two subjects each. Interestingly, one of these mutations (a
splice site mutation at position +5 of the donor splice site
of intron 10) has previously been reported in two unrelated,
protein S-deficient patients of Dutch origin.27Whether this
splice site mutation represents a mutational hot spotremains
to be determined.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients. The protein S-deficient patients selected for the study
were identified during the investigation of individuals with a history
of objectively documented thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism.
Individuals who had developed thrombosis early in life (before 45
years of age) or who had a positive family history (around 30% of
all investigated patients) were screened for protein S deficiency by
determination of free protein S antigen (Table I). In patients found
to he protein S-deficient, as well as in their relatives, free and total
protein S values were measured. Between 1985 and 1994, 19 families
with protein S deficiency type I were identified. From the 19 index

patients, a panel of 10 probands was selected for the molecular
biologic investigations. All index patients had a positive family history for thromboembolism. Except patient 9 4 2 , who is an Argentinean of European origin, and patient 5-I/1, who is German, all index
patients are Austrians.
Protein S determination and diagnostic criteria. Free and total
protein S antigen were measured by a commercial enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). For determination of free protein S, bound protein S was
precipitated with polyethyleneglycol (PEG 8000; 3.75%) according
to the method of Comp et al,'* and free protein S was determined
in the supernatant. The amount of free protein S in PEG-precipitated
pooled normal plasma was defined as 100%.
The lower limit of the normal range for free protein S was 64%
in patients without oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatment and 19% for
patients on OAC. For total protein S, the lower limit of the normal

range was 65% in patients without and 35% in patients with OAC
treatment.
The diagnosis of hereditary protein S deficiency type I was considered as established when decreased free and total protein S values
were repeatedly found in a proband and when protein S deficiency
was detected in at least one further relative, irrespective of the thrombotic history in that individual. Using the above-mentioned cut-off
limits, in three families (families 3, 7, and 9). individuals with decreased free but normal total protein S values (patients 3-U1, 7-I/1,
and 9 4 2 ) were found in addition to the typical type I-deficient
patients. Families in which all deficient family members had type
111 deficiency were not included in our study.
Genomic DNA analyses. Genomic DNA was extracted from
EDTA or citrated blood samples (5 mL) according to standard procedures. For the identification of mutations, we concentrated on the
analysis of the transcribed regions of the PROS 1 gene. Polymerase

method of Sanger?' Primers chosen for PCR amplification (of exons,
including exon-intron boundaries; Table 2) were constructed from
genomic sequences using differences between the PROS 1 and the
PROS 2 genes."-" They were positioned such that the 3' end of at
least one of the two primers was only complementary to the PROS
I gene. As no sequence differences between PROS 1 and PROS 2
were known for exon 3, we amplified this exon and large parts of
boundering introns with primers presumed to be common to both
genes. The PCR product (340 bp for PROS 1) was sequenced, and
the differences found between the known PROS 1 gene sequence
and the pseudogene sequence were used to design PROS l-specific
primers PS-414 and P S 4 5 .
All amplification products included at least 10 nucleotides of 5'

and 3' flanking intron sequences, except for only five nucleotides at
the 5' splice junction of exon 2 and only nine nucleotides at the 3'
splice junction of exon 7. Amplifications were performed in a DNA
Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT) using TaqDNA-polymerase (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. Branchburg, NJ).

Because the pseudogene sequence at the 5' end of intron 14 was
not available, and intron 13 sequences were not appropriate to choose
a PROS 1 gene-specific primer, 0.5-pL PCR products (containing
parts of intron 12, exon 13, intron 13, exon 14, and parts of intron

Heteroduplex analysis of mut-I. GenomicDNAwasamplified
with primers PS-19/1 and PS-P1B. PCR products were separated at
constant voltage (100 V) on precast 6% polyacrylamide gels.
RESULTS

For all 10 index patients, heterozygous hereditary protein
S deficiency type I was verified on the basis of their free
and total protein S values (Table l), as well as their family
histories of protein S deficiency. Except patient 2 4 3 , who
experienced only one thrombotic event,
allindexpatients
had recurrent thrombosis.
Results of DNA analysis. Innine indexpatients,seven
different mutations (mut-l through mut-7; Table 3, Fig
l)
were identified by direct sequence analysis of all exons and
splice regions of the PROS 1 gene. For five mutations (mut1,-2, -3, -5, -7),cosegregation with the disease could be
demonstrated. For mut-4 family 7 and mut-6 family 9, this
was not possible, because pedigrees were incomplete (Fig
2).All sevenmutations were absent in 44 to 62normal
individuals.
In addition to the mutations, the exonic G/A dimorphism
in codon 62632,33andtwo unpublished dimorphisms,one
exonic and one intronic,wereidentifiedin
some patients.

These two dimorphisms were also found in 30 healthy control individuals with an allelic frequency of more than 10%
(data not shown). No other genetic alterations were seen in
the tested sequences.
Among the seven identified mutations, three have a major
impact on theexpected geneproduct:a2-bpdeletion.a
splice site mutation, and a nonsense mutation.
The 2-bp deletion (mut-l) at cDNA positions 2166 and
2167 (cDNA numbering according to Hoskins et al”) leads
to a changed reading frame. Themutation was found in two
unrelated index patients (1-1V4 and 4-VI). Both of them had
experienced recurrent thrombosis. For patient 1 -W4, three
protein S-deficient relatives (two of them symptomatic) as
wellas four relatives with normalprotein S valueswere
tested for the mutation by heteroduplex analysis. All protein
S-deficient family members were found to carry the
deletion,
while it was absent in all unaffected relatives (Table 1) and
in 44 normal controls.
The mutation in the donor splice site of intron 10 (mut2) presumablyaffectssplicing.”
It was observedin two
unrelated index patients (2-1/3 and 3 4 1 ) who both had experienced thrombosis. By direct sequencing of PCR products
(PS-21/1 and PS-22/1), this mutation could be demonstrated
in all protein S-deficient relatives of both index patients, but
was not present in the unaffected relatives or in a group of
45 normal control individuals.
The nonsensemutation in family I O (mut-7) converts arginine-410 into a stop codon. Direct sequencing demonstrated
the presence of this mutation in all three protein S-deficient
experienced
members of this family, of whomtwohad
thrombosis. In two relatives with normal protein S values,
as well as in 44 unrelated normals, the mutation was absent.
Interestingly, the same mutationisfoundintheprotein
S
pseudogene (PROS 2).
Three missense mutations were identified in
exon 14 of
indexpatients 6-V1, 7-1/1, and 8-IIVI: mut-3(Ala575to
Pro), mut-4 (Leu 543 to Gln), and mut-5 (Leu 51 1 to Ser),
respectively. All three missense mutations were present in
the protein S-deficient family
members but absent in relatives with normal protein S levels, and in 46, 52, and 52
normal individuals. Another missense mutation (mut-6) was
identified in exon 10. This mutation changes Leu 310 to Pro,
and was identified in two protein S-deficient brothers. It was
absent in 62 normal individuals.
Results of RNA analysis. RNA isolated from peripheral
blood of six patients was available
for RNA studies. Four
individuals (patientsLW4, 4-Y1,7 4 1 , and 8-IIV2) were
heterozygous forthecodon626G/Adimorphism,
which
affects a Bst X1 restriction site. In all four patients, cDNA
amplification (PS-18/3 and PS-PlB) and digestion with Bst
XI proved the presence of mutant and wild type RNA (Fig
3A). Haplotypes of affected alleles (obtained from pedigree
analysis; data not shown) were G in families I and 4 and A
in family 8. Visual inspection of the Polaroid photographs
indicated higher concentrations of normal transcripts in patients l -11/4, 4-1/1, and 8-111/2. The haplotype of the mut-4
allele (family 7) could not be determined. In families 6 and
10 no individual was heterozygous for the codon 626 dimorphism. Because mut-3 causes the loss of an Eue I site and

to 62 individuals). ,411 mutations were also the only genetic
abnormalities found in the investigated sequencesof the pro-

The causality of the 2-bp deletion (mut-l) and the splice
site mutation (mut-2) forprotein S deficiency is supportedby
the occurrence of each mutation in two different, reportedly
unrelated protein S-deficient families.Mut-2 was alsoidentified in two of eight genetically investigated Dutch families
with protein S deficiency.” Whether this high frequency of
mut-2 is due to thepresence of a mutational hot spot remains
to be determined.
The deletion of two adenines in codon 633 leads to the
useof a newreading frame.The normal stopcodon is
skipped and a new stop codon 62 bases downstream comes
inframe.Thenewsequencecodesfor23aminoacids
(QFLRHLFSAYNTFSLCVIILMFQ), includingonecysteine, instead of only three amino acids(KNS) in individuals
with normal protein S. As we could demonstrate transcription of mutant RNA, it is feasible that an aberrant protein
is translated from this mutant RNA. The secretion of this
protein would presumably be impaired due to interference
with proper folding of one unpaired cysteine contained in
the extra amino acid ~equence.’~~’~
Mutation mut-7 introduces a stop codon at the beginning
of exon 12. Aberrant RNA is absent from ectopic transcripts
inbloodcells,
and a truncated gene product in protein S
synthesizing cells is unlikely.
Mutations mut-3andmut-6 lead tothe replacementof
alanine-575 and leucine-3 10,
respectively, by proline, which
is known to interrupt the formation of any regular repeating
structure. This could destabilize the conformation of protein
S, making it vulnerable against degradation or retaining it
from secretion."^" In a secondary structuremodel of protein
S reported by Schmidel et all8 and calculated according to
Chou and Fasman,” proline-575 would lie in the region of
a conversion of ana-helical into an irregular
structure. Using
the same model, proline-310 would disrupt a region of predicted p sheet structure and would, therefore, significantly
impair the secondary structure.
Common to mut-4 and mut-5 is the change of leucine, a
hydrophobic amino acid, into a polar amino acid: glutamine
and serine, respectively. Leucine-543 (mut-4) is conserved
in human, bovine,38 mouse,’’ and rabbit4’ protein S amino
acid sequences. At position S1 1 (mut-S), all three nonhuman
protein S sequences carry hydrophobic valine. Apparently,
there isa demandforbranched, aliphatic aminoacids at
position 543 and 5 1 1,as evidenced by the high conservation
during evolution.
We could detect transcripts of the mutant allele in four of
five different mutations when we analyzed cDNA generated
from total RNA. No mutanttranscript was found in the case
of the stop codon. In the presence of the 2-bp deletion and
the Leu-51 1 to Ser mutation, the concentrationofmutant
transcripts was lower than of wild type. Our results indicate
that RNA analysis isnot suitable for thedetection of all
mutations in the PROS 1 gene, such as Arg-410 to stop, and
only DNA analysis is adequate.6
Interestingly,ahighfrequency
of missensemutations
(four of seven) was observed. Similar results have already
beenreported for gene alterationsinhereditaryproteinC
deficiency, in which more than half of all mutations are also
missense mutations.4’

MUSTAFA, PABINGER, ANDMANNHALTER

The identification of mutations in the PROS I gene not
only contributes to the understanding of pathogenic mutations, but helps to clarify diagnostic uncertainties. It is well
knownthat an overlap of freeand totalprotein S values
exists in deficient patients andnormal controls. We observed
slightlyreduced free and normal total protein S values in
individual 4-1UI (daughter of a protein S-deficient
father),
and her protein S deficiency status was unclear. Gene analysis could redress uncertainties by demonstrating absence of
thePROS 1 gene mutationinthisindividual.
Thus,our
study also shows the value of gene analysis for diagnostic
applications.
