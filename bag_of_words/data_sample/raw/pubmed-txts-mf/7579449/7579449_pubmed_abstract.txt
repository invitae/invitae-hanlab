We identified potentially causative mutations in the active protein S gene (PROS 1) by direct sequencing of PROS 1-specific polymerase chain reaction (PRC) products of all 15 exons, including exon-intron boundaries in 10 families with hereditary protein S deficiency type I. Seven different mutations were found in 9 of 10 families, including one frame shift mutation, a previously published splice site mutation (both occurring in two unrelated families), four missense mutations, and a stop codon at the beginning of exon 12. In family studies, cosegregation of the mutation with the disease could be demonstrated for five mutations; for two missense mutations, this was not possible due to limited family data. All seven mutations were the only abnormalities identified in the respective index patients and were absent in 44 to 62 normal individuals. Therefore, they most likely represent the causal gene defects. For five mutations, analysis of ectopic RNA could be performed. Mutant transcripts were present in the case of the frame shift and three of the missense mutations, while no mutant RNA could be detected in the case of the stop codon.
