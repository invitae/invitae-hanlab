Summary
In a previous study we identified 14 cases with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or its milder variant,
Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), with a deletion of exons 3-7, a deletion that would be expected to shift
the translational reading frame of the mRNA and give a severe phenotype. We have examined dystrophin and
its mRNA from muscle biopsies of seven cases with either mild or intermediate phenotypes. In all cases we
detected slightly lower-molecular-weight dystrophin in 12%-15% abundance relative to the normal. By
sequencing amplified mRNA we have found that exon 2 is spliced to exon 8, a splice that produces a
frameshifted mRNA, and have found no evidence for alternative splicing that might be involved in restoration
of dystrophin mRNA reading frame in the patients with a mild phenotype. Other transcriptional and
posttranscriptional mechanisms such as cryptic promoter, ribosomal frameshifting, and reinitiation are suggested that might play some role in restoring the reading frame.

Introduction

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and its milder
variant, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), are allelic
X-linked disorders caused by mutations in the gene
coding for dystrophin, a 427-kD cytoskeletal protein
(Worton and Thompson 1988). DMD is a rapidly
progressive disease in which the affected boys lose the
ability to walk independently before the age of 12
years. BMD has a slower rate of progression, affected
boys remaining ambulant beyond the age of 16 years,
with a few leading near-normal lives. Those who lose
independent ambulation between the ages of 12 and
16 years are classified as "intermediates" (Dubowitz
1978, 1989; Emery 1987).

Approximately 60% of individuals affected with
DMD and BMD have a deletion of one or more exons
of the dystrophin gene, but no correlation has been
found between the site or the extent of deletion and
the severity of the disease (den Dunnen et al. 1989;
Gillard et al. 1989; Koenig et al. 1989). In the majority
of cases, deletions that maintain the translational
reading frame of mRNA result in a mild phenotype
presumably due to the production of a shorter but
partially functional dystrophin molecule. In contrast,
deletions that shift the translational reading frame of
mRNA usually result in a severe phenotype (DMD),
consistent with production of inactive truncated protein (Monaco et al. 1988; Bulman et al. 1991b). There
are, however, a number of notable exceptions to this
reading-frame rule. In our earlier study of deletions
confined to the first 10 exons of the gene (Malhotra et
al. 1988), we identified three severe (DMD), six mild
(BMD), and five intermediate cases, all with a deletion
of exons 3-7, a deletion predicted to shift the reading
frame. In several studies of deletions throughout the
dystrophin gene (Baumbach et al. 1989; den Dunnen
et al. 1989; Gillard et al. 1989; Koenig et al. 1989)

Dystrophin in Frameshift Deletion Patients

approximately 6% of the patients have now been identified as exceptions to the reading-frame rule. In the
present report, an extensive analysis of dystrophin and
its mRNA has been carried out for seven patients with
a deletion of exons 3-7.
Material and Methods
Patients

Seven affected males examined in this study are described in table 1. Individuals classified as BMD patients include H1456, H3924, and UHH.DF. H1456
is a 37-year-old male who lost ambulation at age 33
years, and H3924 is 22 years old and still ambulant.
UHH.DF is a 6-year-old familial BMD case who presented at age 3 years with proximal muscle weakness
but who can still run and jump. His classification was
based on his uncle with classic BMD, who could walk
independently at the age of 24 years. H3975, an unusual case of BMD (?BMD), presented at age 5 years
with myoglobulinuria, complained of fatigue, but had
no overt clinical muscle weakness. He died at age 7
years of rhabdomyolysis. His prognosis indicated that
he would have remained ambulant beyond the age of
12 years. H4058 is a 26-year-old intermediate patient
who presented at the age of 8 years. He was provided
with braces at age 121/2 years and was ambulant to the
age of 20 years, an age well outside the usual DMD
range. Patients too young to be classified as either
intermediate or BMD are classified here as intermediate/BMD and include H4049 and UHS1323. H4049
is a 15-year-old patient who presented at the age of
71/2 years and is still ambulant. Case UHS1323 is a
13-year-old male who presented at the age 71/2 years.
His disease progression is very slow, similar to that of
BMD.

Case numbers with the prefix "H" are from Hammersmith Hospital, London; "UHS" is from the University Hospital, Saskatchewan; and "UHH" is from
the University Hospital, Hershey, PA. In a previous
study, cases H1456, H4049, H4058, and UHS1323
have been referred to as "Guysl456," "Guys1587,"
"Guys991," and "HSC1323," respectively (Malhotra
et al. 1988).
Antibody Production

The anti-dystrophin antisera P6, recognizing amino
acids 2814-3028, and 1461, recognizing the last 17
amino acids of dystrophin (amino acids 3667-3685),
were raised in rabbits. Production, purification, and
characterization of antisera 1461 and P6 have been
described in detail (Zubrzycka-Gaarn et al. 1991;
T. G. Sherratt and P. N. Strong, unpublished data).
Antiserum 9219, recognizing amino acids 67-667
from exons 4-16, was raised in sheep (Bulman et al.
1991a). The rabbit anti-60K dystrophin antibodies
(amino acids 407-815) were a gift to one of us (P.N.S.)
from Dr. L. Kunkel, Boston (Hoffman et al. 1987).
Western Blot and Immunocytochemical Analysis

Western blot analysis and the densitometric quantitation were carried out using P6, anti-60K, and 1461
antibodies according to a method described elsewhere
(Patel et al. 1988). Dilutions for the primary antibodies were 1:3,000 for P6 and 1:1,000 for the anti-60K
and 1461 antibodies. A peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody was used for the detection of
bound P6 and anti-60 K antidystrophin antibodies,
and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antirabbit secondary antibody was used to detect bound
1461 antibody. For immunocytochemical analyses,
5-7-mm-thick transverse cryostat sections were pre-

pared from frozen muscle biopsies. Sections were immunostained with antibodies 1461 and 9219 at dilutions 1:40 and 1:500, respectively, and the bound
antibodies were detected with a horseradish peroxidase system according to a method described elsewhere (Zubrzycka-Gaarn et al. 1988). The sections

primers by the dideoxy sequencing method (Sanger et
al. 1977) or sequenced directly using Sequenase (USB)
and DMSO buffer according to a method described
elsewhere (Winship 1989).

Southern Blot Analysis

Dystrophin Analysis

DNA (5 Lg) was digested with EcoRI, HindIII, and
BamHI restriction endonucleases, was separated on
0.7% agarose gels, and was transferred to Hybond-N
membrane. The membranes were hybridized with
32P-dCTP random-primed DNA probes. The intron 7
probes used for the analysis included XJ (DXS208)region probes XJ1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.3, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1,
6.2, 7.1, and 7.2 (Ray et al. 1985; Thompson et al.
1986; Malhotra et al. 1988).

Western blot analysis of seven cases with a deletion
of exons 3-7 indicated that they all had dystrophin of
an estimated size of 380 kD (fig. 1). The levels of
dystrophin estimated by densitometric analysis were
approximately 12%-15% of that found in normal
adult muscle. Identical results were obtained using
two different polyclonal antibodies-(1) anti-60K,
recognizing amino acids 407-815, and (2) P6, recognizing amino acids 2814-3028. A muscle sample from
individual UHS1323 was analyzed using the 1461 antibody alone, but, because of the limited amount of
tissue, it was not possible to do quantitative estimation
of dystrophin for this individual.
To determine whether the dystrophin of reduced
size was correctly localized at the sarcolemma, muscle
sections from three BMD individuals (H3924, H3975,
and UHH.DF) and from one intermediate/BMD individual (UHS1323) were immunolabeled with the
amino-terminal (9219) and carboxy-terminal (1461)
antibodies (fig. 2). In three of the samples examined
(H3975, UHH.DF, and UHS1323), a large proportion of fibers displaying uniform peripheral staining
were observed; however, a few dystrophin-negative
fibers were also present. Although the staining intensity was quite variable, in general it was lower than
normal. All fibers from case H3924 (fig. 2, panel 2)
were dystrophin positive, with staining intensity similar to that of normal fiber. However, as the biopsy
from this individual consisted mainly of connective
tissue, only about 150 muscle fibers, all necrotic, were
scored for each antibody. The presence of dystrophin
at its correct localization in the muscle of patients helps
to explain the mild phenotype and suggests that transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanisms must
account for the production of dystrophin in BMD patients with a deletion of exons 3-7.

cDNA Amplification and Sequencing

The forward (F) and reverse (R) oligonucleotide
primers identical and complementary to mRNA sequences were 1F (exon 1), 5'-GACGAATTCGGTGGGAAGAAGTAGAGGACTG-3'; 9R (exon 9),

5'-GACGAATTCGGCTTAGGGGAAGAAGTTCTCTCA-3'; 1OR (exon 10), 5'-CACTCTCCATCAATGAACTG-3'; 1SR (exon 15), 5'-GACGAATTCTGTGAATCTTGTTCACTGCATC-3'; and 16R
(exon 16), 5'-ATACAGTTTGCCCATGGATTGC3'. The underlined sequence contains an EcoRI restriction-enzyme site to facilitate cloning.
Total mRNA was isolated from 1-5 mg of muscle
tissue (Chomczynski and Sacchi 1987; Muntoni and
Strong 1989), and the first-strand cDNA synthesis was
carried out using 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia reverse transcriptase according to a method described elsewhere (Bulman et al. 1991a). cDNA from
normal and deletion cases was subjected to PCR using
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) buffer (Kogan et al. 1987)
and Taq polymerase (Cetus). Amplified products were
separated on 1.5% agarose gel, and the gel was blotted
onto GeneScreen +TN and was probed with a cloned
cDNA or an internal oligonucleotide primer. For large
PCR products generated with the 1F and 15R primer
set, end-labeled 15R primer was added in the PCR
reaction mixture to increase the sensitivity of detection. In this case, amplified products from 30 cycles
were separated on 1.2% agarose gels and were dried
and autoradiographed.
Gel-purified amplified products were either cloned

dystrophin band) was observed. Identical results were obtained using the rabbit anti-60K dystrophin antibodies. Similar results were
also obtained for H1456, H3924, UHH.DF, and UHS1323 (for
the H3924 and UHH.DF dystrophin immunoblot analysis, only
the anti-60K antibodies were used; and, for UHS1323, only the
carboxy-terminal antibody 1461 was used, according to a method
described elsewhere [Bulman et al. 1991b]).

2 or exon 8 in the cases with a deletion of exons
3-7 would result in an mRNA with an unaltered reading frame (Chelly et al. 1990;, Arahata et al. 1991).
Indeed, there is extensive alternative splicing in the
mRNAs of a number of muscle-specific genes (Smith
et al. 1989), including the dystrophin mRNA (Feener
et al. 1989). We have used reverse transcriptase and
PCR to examine splicing products from seven patients
with a deletion of exons 3-7, all of whom display a
mild phenotype. In initial experiments, cDNA was

prepared from a primer (1OR) in exon 10, and amplification utilized primers in exons 1 and 9. The predicted size of the amplified product is 892 bp from
normal dystrophin mRNA and 336 bp if exon 2 is
spliced to exon 8. Alternative splicing of exon 1 to
exon 8 or of exon 2 to exon 9 gives PCR products of
274 or 154 bp, respectively. Neither of these alternative splice patterns would shift the reading frame of
the message.
As shown in the top left panel of figure 3, a 336-bp
exon 2-8 splice product was observed in all patients.
In normal individuals the 892-bp band corresponding
to the intact mRNA was observed. No bands corresponding to an exon 1-8 splice or to an exon 2-9

splice were observed. Similar results were obtained
when the PCR products were assayed by Southern blot
analysis with radiolabeled cDNA or with exon-specific
probes for exon 2 or exon 8 (fig. 3, bottom left panel).
The precise splicing of exon 2 to exon 8 in the 336-bp
amplified fragment was verified by sequencing of
cloned PCR products, as well as by direct sequencing
of the amplified products. The sequence (fig. 3, top
right panel) confirmed that the 3' end of exon 2 was
joined directly to the 5' end of exon 8.
In addition to the expected 336- and 892-bp products, a minor band, slightly larger than the major
product, was seen in all samples (fig. 3, top left and
bottom left panels). To determine the origin of this

498-bp fragment from patient DNA (denoted by an
asterisk in the top left and bottom panels of fig. 3),
amplified DNA was eluted from an agarose gel and
was reamplified and sequenced directly. This DNA
fragment contained a 162-bp sequence of unknown
origin, spliced between exons 1 and 2 of the dystrophin transcript; and it contained stop codons in all
three reading frames. Southern blots of human genomic DNA probed with this insert gave a smear pattern,
indicating its repetitive nature. The inserted DNA is
likely from intron 1 and is likely due to aberrant splicing; however, because of its repetitive nature, it was
not possible to confirm the origin of this DNA by
Southern blot analysis.

Dystrophin in Frameshift Deletion Patients
Other alternatively spliced transcripts, such as exon
2 spliced to exon 10, 11, 13, 14, or 15, would also
restore the translational reading frame, and such
mRNA(s) would have been undetected by the primer
sets chosen above. In view of the immunoreactivity of
patient dystrophin to antiserum raised against exons
4-16 of the DMD gene, the 3' end of the spliced-out
region could not extend beyond exon 15. In order to
investigate the possible presence of one of these species
of dystrophin mRNA, a longer cDNA synthesized
from a primer in exon 16 was amplified with primers
from exons 1 and 15 (fig. 4). The major amplified
product in each patient was 1.21 kb in size, the size
expected from splicing of exons 2-8. In case H3975,
a smaller-sized product (1.08 kb) was also amplified
(fig. 4, lane b). The 1.08-kb DNA was eluted from the
agarose gel and was reamplified, cloned, and sequenced. Of three different clones sequenced, two
were missing exon 9, as well as exons 3-7; in the third
clone, exon 9 was present, but exon 12, as well as
exons 3-7, were absent. Deletions of exons 9 and 12
are possibly due to missplicing events. Missplicing,
both that which is deletion induced and that which
occurs in normal muscle, has been reported in the
DMD gene (Chelly et al. 1990); however, the large
extent of missplicing in H3975 mRNA is not yet explainable. In any event, a deletion of either exon 9 or
exon 12, when accompanied by a deletion of exons
3-7, does not restore the translational reading frame
and therefore cannot explain the mild phenotype in
this individual. Thus, in two sets of experiments we
have been unable to detect alternatively spliced mRNA
that could explain the presence of dystrophin in the
mild cases.
RNA Editing

In the patients discussed above, deletion or insertion
of nucleotides in the mature mRNA (RNA editing)
could also bring the reading frame back into register.
However, RNA editing would have to restore the
reading frame before a stop codon was encountered in
exon 8. Sequencing of PCR-amplified products did not
reveal any sequence changes, ruling out RNA editing
as the possible mechanism to restore the reading frame
in these mildly affected individuals.
Deletion-Endpoint Mapping

It is possible that a deletion-induced cryptic promoter in intron 2 or intron 7 could be responsible
for initiating synthesis of mRNA that would not have
amplified in the experiments described above. In sev-

eral genes, downstream promoters have been described; for example, the two different isotypes for
alkali myosin light-chain MLC1 and MLC3F are encoded by a single locus that has two distinct promoters
and gives rise to two different transcripts (Daubas et
al. 1985). Introns 2 and 7 in the dystrophin gene are
very large (Malhotra et al. 1988; Boyce et al. 1991)
and could contain promoter-like elements. To investigate this possibility, deletion breakpoints were
mapped. The availability of a large number of probes
throughout intron 7 (the XJ region) (Ray et al. 1985;
Thompson et al. 1986) has allowed us to map the 3'
deletion breakpoint in 11 individuals with a deletion
of exons 3-7. As shown in figure 5, the deletion endpoints of both BMD and intermediate patients are
scattered throughout intron 7, and that of one severe
patient is internal to the breakpoints in mild patients.
The lack of correlation between the 3' endpoint and
severity of phenotype argues against the presence of
an intron 7 promoter-like element that is activated by
the deletion. It is still a possibility that such elements
exist in intron 2, and in that case the putative promoter
element(s) is expected to initiate transcription at an
unidentified exon contained in intron 2. Such an exon
would not be included in the normal dystrophin
mRNA.

Discussion

One potential explanation for the mild phenotype
in apparent frameshift individuals was that in some
patients the deleterious effect of the lack of dystrophin
is mitigated by some unknown factor. Indeed, mdx
mice, lacking dystrophin, do not display a severe phenotype (Sicinski et al. 1989). It was, therefore, essential to establish whether dystrophin was being produced in these mild cases with a deletion of exons 3-7.

The western blot analysis revealed that dystrophin,
though less abundant and slightly reduced in size, was
present in patients displaying a mild phenotype with
a deletion of exons 3-7. The immunocytochemical
analysis revealed that it was correctly localized in the
sarcolemma. This obviated the need to postulate the
involvement of secondary factors and suggested that
transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanisms
must account for the production of dystrophin in
BMD patients with a deletion of exons 3-7.
The transcript analysis did not identify an in-frame
transcript in these BMD patients, indicating that alternative splicing could not be documented to account
for the presence of dystrophin in these mild cases.
Our results are in apparent contradiction with those of
Chelly et al. (1990), who found that, in two BMD
patients with a deletion of exons 3-7, in-frame alternatively spliced mRNA (exon 1 spliced to exon 8 and
exon 2 spliced to exon 10) existed at levels of 1%-2%
of the amount of out-of-frame mRNA. In our own
experiments, PCR analysis from a serial dilution of
patient cDNA indicated that we could have detected
message present at 1%-2% of the level of the exon
2-8 splice product. Also, the fact that we detected

aberrant splicing makes it unlikely that any substantial
amount of alternative splicing was missed in our experiments. The biological significance of the low level
of in-frame transcripts described by Chelly et al.
(1990) is unclear, although it is possible that this level
of mRNA might account for the 12%-15% of dystrophin, if translation was up-regulated in response to
the dystrophin deficiency.
Arahata et al. (1991) have described two cases with
a deletion of exons 3-7 in whom muscle sections stain
negatively with antibodies raised against a synthetic
peptide from exon 8 and stain positively with antibodies raised against a peptide from exons 13 / 14. A negative result with exon 8-specific antibody is difficult
to interpret, as it is likely that the configuration of
dystrophin produced in these patients would be disrupted and that epitopes recognized by the antisera
could be altered.
Other mechanisms that might be involved in the
production of dystrophin in the deletion patients include RNA editing, the presence of a cryptic promoter,
reinitiation, and ribosomal frameshifting. RNA editing has been observed in trypanosomes (Benne 1990)
and mammalian apolipoprotein-B RNA (Chen et al.
1990), as well as in plant mtRNAs (Covello and Gray
1989). Sequencing of amplified RNA from individuals
with a deletion of exons 3-7 in the dystrophin gene
did not reveal any sequence changes, suggesting that
extensive RNA editing is unlikely to be the mechanism
for reestablishing the translational frame. Also, a new
mRNA synthesized from a cryptic promoter in intron
7 seems highly unlikely, given the scattered distribution of deletion endpoints in the intron. A cryptic promoter in intron 2 remains a formal possibility, since

the probes were not available to map the deletion endpoints in this intron.
In a number of biological systems, secondary reading frames are used for coordinate expression of proteins. In these systems ribosomal frameshifting or reinitiation ofprotein synthesis on internal AUG codons
allows access to alternative reading frames (Cattaneo
1989). In an earlier study, we have described an internal AUG with a Kozak consensus sequence in exon 8
of the dystrophin gene, a situation that could allow
the translation of a shortened dystrophin molecule beginning at amino acid 253 (Malhotra et al. 1988).
Such a protein would be predicted to have a molecular
weight of 398 kD, similar in size to the dystrophin
found in these patients (fig. 1). Ribosomal frameshifting, on the other hand, would allow translation of
dystrophin from the first AUG in exon 1 and would
restore the frame around the deletion junction in exon
2 or exon 8. Such a protein would be predicted to have
an approximate size of 405 kD, not distinguishable
from the 398 kD predicted by the reinitiation model.
The experiments described here cannot exclude, or
distinguish between, these possibilities.
There are a number of other deletions that are confined to the first 10 exons of the dystrophin gene and
that follow the reading-frame rule. Deletions of exons
3 and 3-4 are in-frame events, and, as expected, individuals with these deletions have the mild phenotype
(Koenig et al. 1989). On the other hand, deletions of
exons 3-6, 4-7, 5-7, and 8-9 are expected to cause
a shift in the translational frame, and these individuals
have the severe phenotype (Malhotra et al. 1988).
Therefore, at the 5' end of the gene, with deletions
confined to the first 10 exons, the exceptions to the
reading-frame rule are limited only to the deletions of
exons 3-7. It is possible that, because of the involvement of large introns (introns 2 and 7) at both deletion
breakpoints, the topology of the gene with this deletion is different from that of other deletions at the
5' end of the gene. It is also possible that different
transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms
could be operative in restoring the translational reading frame, and this could explain the variation in
phenotype in individuals with this deletion. Unfortunately, at present there are not any reports of dystrophin studies on the severe (i.e., DMD) patients with
a deletion of exons 3-7, and we were unable to obtain
biopsies from such individuals. Such studies are essential for understanding the variable phenotype in patients with this deletion.
In conclusion, we found dystrophin in BMD and

569

intermediate patients with a frameshift deletion of exons 3-7. We did not find any evidence for alternative
splicing and RNA editing as operative mechanisms in
restoring the reading frame in these patients. Mapping
of 3' deletion endpoints in intron 7 argues against activation of a cryptic promoter in this intron. Yet, the
translational reading frame is restored by a transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanism. Reinitiation
of protein synthesis from the AUG in exon 8 is one
possibility, while ribosomal frameshifting is another
possibility, for restoring the proper reading frame.
The knowledge of the exact position of deletion breakpoints, and the use of exon-specific antibodies, may
make it possible to determine the mechanism(s) involved in restoration of reading frame in these deletion
patients. It is also likely that, depending on the nature
of the deletion breakpoints, different mechanisms
could be involved in different patients, as the intronic
sequences could play important roles.
