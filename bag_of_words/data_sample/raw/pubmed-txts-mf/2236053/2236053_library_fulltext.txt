ABSTRACT
Additional mutations in the cystic fibrosis
(CF) gene were identified in the regions corresponding to the
two putative nucleotide (ATP)-binding folds (NBFs) of the
predicted polypeptide. The patient cohort included 46 Canadian CF families with well-characterized DNA marker haplotypes spanning the disease locus and several other families from
Israel. Eleven mutations were found in the first NBF, 2 were
found in the second NBF, but none was found in the R-domain.
Seven of the mutations were of the missense type affecting some
of the highly conserved amino acid residues in the first NBF; 3
were nonsense mutations; 2 would probably affect mRNA
splicing; 2 corresponded to small deletions, including another 3-base-pair deletion different from the major mutation
(AF508), which could account for 70% of the CF chromosomes
in the population. Nine of these mutations accounted for 12 of
the 31 non-AF508 CF chromosomes in the Canadian families.
The highly heterogeneous nature of the remaining CF mutations provides important insights into the structure and function of the protein, but it also suggests that DNA-based genetic
screening for CF carrier status will not be straightforward.
The gene responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF) has recently
been identified and the major mutation has been defined at
the DNA level (1-3), providing a direct means for elucidating
the basic defect in this disease and for giving an accurate
genetic diagnosis. Sequence analysis of overlapping cDNA
clones predicts a protein consisting of 1480 amino acids and
containing membrane-associated regions and nucleotide
(ATP)-binding folds (NBFs); this putative protein product
has been named the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (2). The major mutation corresponds
to a 3-base-pair (bp) deletion, which results in the loss of a
phenylalanine residue at amino acid position 508 (AF508),
within the first NBF (NBF1) of CFTR (2, 3). This mutation
accounts for =70% of all CF chromosomes, and haplotype
analysis suggests that all AF508 chromosomes are derived
from the same origin (3-5).
On the basis of DNA marker haplotype analysis, the remaining 30o of CF chromosomes are expected to be heterogeneous
with respect to the nature of the mutations (3). Since each
mutation marks a functionally important region of CFTR, it is
expected that identification of additional mutations in the CF
gene will provide useful information about the structure and
function of the protein, in understanding the pathophysiology of
the disease, and in development of pharmaceutical agents for
better treatment of individuals with CF. Furthermore, identifiThe publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge

cation of CF mutations at the DNA level will provide the
required information basis for genetic testing, especially when
population screening for CF carriers is considered.
Since the major CF mutation occurs within the first NBF
of CFTR, it is reasonable to assume that additional mutations
might also be found within the two NBFs for the remaining
30% of CF chromosomes. In this communication, we report
the result of a survey of the CF gene, in regions corresponding to the two NBFs and the R-domain of the protein, for the
presence of additional mutations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DNA Samples. The majority of CF families used in this
study have been described (6). Extensive DNA marker
haplotype information was available for the CF chromosomes in 46 Canadian families (3). A small number of
additional CF families with unique geographic or ethnic
backgrounds were included in the mutational screening; the
ones reported here were recruited in the Chaim Sheba
Medical Center in Israel.
Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCRs). DNA sequences spanning individual exons were amplified by PCR with oligonucleotide primers located in the respective flanking introns.
The general procedure for PCR has been described (7, 8). The
specific oligonucleotide primers used for the amplification of
individual exon sequences are listed in Table 1 (details of the
intron/exon boundary sequences will be published elsewhere). All oligonucleotides were purchased from the Hospital for Sick Children DNA Biotechnology Service Center.
Approximately 500 ng of genomic DNA from cultured lymphoblastoid cell lines or peripheral blood of each individual
was used in each reaction. Typically, DNA samples were
heated at 940C for 6 min and then subjected to 30 cycles of
denaturation (940C for 30 sec), primer annealing (550C for 30
sec), and extension (720C for 60 sec) with 2.5 units of Thermus
aquaticus DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase) (PerkinElmer/Cetus), followed by a final extension period of 7 min
in a Perkin-Elmer/Cetus DNA thermal cycler.
DNA Sequence Determination. Sequencing of cloned DNA
was performed according to the dideoxynucleotide chaintermination method essentially as described (2, 9) with the
Sequenase kit (United States Biochemical). The method for
direct sequencing of PCR products was modified from published procedures (10) with either one of the PCR primers or

Allele-Specific Oligonucleotide (ASO) Hybridization. The
oligonucleotide hybridization condition has been described
(3). The normal and mutant specific oligonucleotides are
listed in Table 2. Hybridization was performed at 37°C and
the washings were done twice with 5x SSC (lx SSC = 0.15
M NaCl/0.015 M sodium citrate) for 10 min each at room
temperature followed by two washings with 2x SSC for 30
min each at 45°C-57°C; the exact temperature was determined empirically for each ASO as indicated.
Cloning of PCR Products. In one case (A1507), in which
direct sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA did not
allow unequivocal determination of nucleotide sequence alteration in the patient, cloning of the mutant allele was
necessary. The two homoduplexes (94 and 97 bp) generated
by PCR amplification of the genomic DNA from the father,
who was found to contribute the mutant allele in question on
the basis of hybridization analysis (data not shown), were
purified from a 5% polyacrylamide gel and cloned into
Bluescript KS vector (Stratagene). One clone, 5-3-15, was
isolated by its lack of hybridization with the oligonucleotide
N (3). The sequence obtained from this clone was in perfect
agreement with that derived from direct DNA sequencing of
the PCR products.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Initially, we had selected a small number of individuals rep-

resentative of different haplotype groups (3) for detection of
unusual CF mutations, as we assumed that there were only a

limited number of mutations and that CF chromosomes in the
same DNA marker haplotype group might carry identical
mutations. Since, as the study continued, many more CF
mutations had been discovered than previously anticipated,
we included all the CF families (patients) with non-AF508
mutations in our study population. We also included several
CF individuals whose DNA marker haplotypes were not
determined.
Detection of Mutations. Direct DNA sequencing for the
genomic DNA regions spanning the two NBFs (exons 9-12
and 19-23) and the R-domain (exon 13) was performed for 29
individuals carrying 40 CF chromosomes with mutations
other than AF508. The results are shown in Table 3. A total
of 13 mutations were identified: 11 of them were located in the
first NBF and 2 were in the second NBF, but none were in
the R-domain. Two of these mutations, G551D (12) and
W1282X (14), have been reported previously; 2 others, AI507
(M. Schwarz, C. Summers, L. Heptinstall, C. Newton, A.
Markham, R. Cain, and M. Super, unpublished data) and
1717-1G -- A (16), have also been described by other
investigators independently.
Different lines of evidence indicate that the sequence
alterations detected in this study were disease causing: (i)

Medical Sciences: Kerem et al.

three of the changes (Q493X, G542X, W1282X) were nonsense mutations that predict production of truncated polypeptides; (ii) five of the missense mutations (A455E, S5491,
S549R, G551D, R560T) occurred at highly conserved amino
acid residues in the first NBF; (iii) two mutations altered the
sequence at

splice junctions-one (1717-iG

-*

A) switched

the highly conserved AG (17) to AA, and the other (R560T),
which was also a missense mutation, substituted AC for AG
immediately upstream of the splice acceptor site, creating an
alteration known to reduce efficiency of splicing (18); (iv) one
mutation (3659delC) caused a single base-pair deletion that
would result in a frameshift and premature termination; (v)
one mutation (AI507) corresponded to a 3-bp deletion immediately upstream of the position for the phenylalanine codon
deleted in AF508; (vi) two missense mutations (Y563N and
P574H) would result in a drastic change ofthe encoded amino
acids. Although the chromosomes carrying the various mutations described above were not fully sequenced to exclude
the possibility of other coexisting alterations, as has been
done for AF508, none of the changes were found among the
normal chromosomes, some of which shared extensive DNA
marker haplotype as the mutant chromosomes (data not
shown). The absence of the same alterations in haplotypematched chromosomes for most mutations suggested that the
sequence alterations were not polymorphisms.
While the majority of the mutations described in this report
(Table 3) appeared to be rare in the population, as only single
cases were detected, two of the mutations, A455E and
G551D, occurred more than once among the present Canadian chromosome population-two were detected for A455E
and three were detected for G551D. In an earlier study,
Cutting et al. (12) reported that 6 of 35 (17%) non-AF508 CF
chromosomes screened carried the G551D mutation. Preliminary data from studies of other populations indicated that the
G542X and S5491 mutations were also relatively abundant;
for example, 5 of 59 (8.4%) non-AF508 CF chromosomes
were found to carry G542X in the Jewish population in Israel
and 1 of the CF Arabic patients was homozygous S5491.
Together, these four mutations may account for 10-20o of
the non-AF508 CF chromosomes.
In addition to the mutations described above, we have
detected three DNA sequence variations that occur on normal chromosomes: two of them, at nucleotide positions 1716
(G or A) and 2694 (T or G), do not appear to affect the

G), results in either methionine or valine.
DNA Marker Haplotype. Determination of the DNA marker haplotype associated with each of the mutations is important, not only in providing a reference for mutant classification
but also in tracing the origins of mutations, thereby gaining
insights into the possible cause for the high frequency of CF
mutations in the Caucasian population.
Our previous study showed that chromosomes carrying the
AF508 mutation were derived from the same origin (3). To
determine whether ancestral relationships existed among CF
chromosomes carrying the other mutations, DNA marker
haplotypes were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1, the chromosomes containing A455E and G551D share the same haplotypes for DNA markers spanning the CF gene, groups lb and
III, respectively. The G551D chromosomes detected by
Cutting et al. (12) also appear to have haplotype III. The
A1507 mutation described here carries a group III haplotype
(Fig. 1) and it is in good agreement with the partial haplotype
data for another example of this mutation independently
identified (M. Schwarz, C. Summers, L. Heptinstall, C.
Newton, A. Markham, R. Cain, and M. Super, unpublished
data). Therefore, these haplotype data suggest that CF chromosomes harboring the same mutation were probably derived from a common origin.
Chromosomes within the same haplotype group, however,
may harbor different mutations (e.g., those in groups Ila and
or

chromosomes examined.

III; Fig. 1). It is of interest to note that four different
mutations have already been identified on CF chromosomes
with haplotype III, which is infrequent among the N chromosomes (3). The number of mutations in the CF gene would
therefore greatly exceed that predicted on the basis of
haplotype analysis (3), as has been observed thus far.
The extended DNA marker haplotypes were not determined for five of the CF mutations-namely, G542X,
W1282X, S549R, S549I, and 1717-1G -* A-because the
patients in whom these mutations were found were all
recently recruited from Israel. The G542X mutation was first
found in an Ashkenazic Jewish patient whose other CF
chromosome was W1282X; S549R was discovered in a Moroccan-Jewish individual who also carried AF508; S549I and
1717-1G -* A were both first detected in Arabic patients.
On the basis of ASO-hybridization and haplotype data, we
previously suspected that one of the CF chromosomes with
haplotype group III might carry a recurring AF508 mutation
(3). Direct DNA sequence analysis, however, revealed that
the mutation carried by this chromosome was AI507 (Table 3
and Fig. 1), differing from AF508 by a single nucleotide, A
instead of T. The marked difference between haplotype III
and haplotype Ia, which is associated with AF508, suggests
that the two mutations are derived from different origins.
Hot Spots for Mutations. There appeared to be a difference
in distribution of mutations between the two NBFs-the
number of mutations detected in the first NBF (exons 9-12)
and 6 times that in the second NBF (exons 19-23). In addition,
although the sample size is small, exon 11 seems to contain the
most mutations (this study; ref. 12). It is possible that the first
NBF, particularly the exon 11 region, is more critical for
CFTR function. Alternatively, the DNA sequences encoding
the first NBF may be relatively more unstable than other
regions. The latter explanation is supported by two lines of
observations. First, only two 3-bp deletions have so far been
detected in the CF gene; both occur in the same region within
exon 10. Second, several sequence alterations have been
detected for the AGT codon for serine at position 549 in exon
11; while Cutting et al. (12) reported a change of this codon to
AAT for asparagine (S549N), this study shows two additional
mutations at this position-T to G transversion for S549R and
G to T transversion for S549I.
Implications in Protein Structure. Since no major deletion
or rearrangement has been detected in CF, the discovery of
nonsense, frameshift, and splicing mutations in the gene is
surprising. It is also somewhat surprising that no mutation
was found in the R-domain, a region that was thought to have
a regulatory function (2). The only mutation reported for the
region so far was a 2-bp insertion toward the end of this
domain (19). The paucity of mutations in this region suggests
that either the R-domain is not critical for function or
mutations in this part of the protein cannot be tolerated. On
the other hand, patients homozygous for nonsense (ref. 20;
H. Cuppens, P. Marynen, C. De Boeck, F. Baets, E. Eggermont, H. Van den Berghe, and J. J. Cassiman, unpublished
data) or splicing (data not shown) mutations have been
detected, suggesting that total loss of CFTR function is not
incompatible with life.
The occurrence of AI507 and AF508 in the same region of the
presumptive ATP-binding domain of CFTR is noteworthy.
First, it is unclear which 3 bp were deleted in both cases (Fig.
2). In A1507, the deleted amino acid may be the isoleucine
residue at position 506. Second, the amino acid residues
involved, Phe-508 and Ile-507 (or Ile-506), are located in a
polypeptide segment linking the two highly conserved regions
believed to be the nucleotide contacting points (2, 22). Deletion of either one of the two amino acids is sufficient to disrupt
the gene function. Furthermore, amino acid substitutions in
this region have been found in two rare variants of normal
chromosomes (with Phe-508 replaced by a cysteine and Ile-506

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 (1990)

replaced by a valine) without apparent loss of function of the
protein (23). Therefore, the length of the polypeptide may be
more important than the actual amino acid residues in this
region for CFTR. Since the length of the linking segment varies
among different ATP-binding proteins and the amino acid
sequences are less conserved, the functional importance of
Ile-507 and Phe-508 is probably unique to CFTR.
Five of the missense mutations (A455E, S5491, S549R,
G551D, R560T) occurred at amino acid residues highly conserved among the various NBFs from different proteins,
suggesting that these residues are critical in ATP binding (2).
The role of the two other missense mutations (Y563N,
P574H) within the NBFs is not immediately apparent, although both mutations would drastically change the amino
acid types. It is anticipated, however, that knowledge about
these and other (12, 14, 19, 24) naturally occurring mutations
will be an essential part in understanding the structure and
function of the protein. In conjunction with development of
three-dimensional structural analysis and tests for the biological activities of CFTR, it should be possible to define the
role of each of these residues at the molecular level and,
eventually, the function of the protein.
Clinical Phenotype. Our previous studies (3, 25) showed
that the pancreatic function of CF patients was at least in part
predisposed by their genotypes at the CF locus. We hypothesized that CF mutations could be divided into two classesnamely, severe and mild (with respect to pancreatic involvement). Patients with two severe alleles are expected to be
pancreatic insufficient (PI) and patients with one or two
copies of mild alleles are pancreatic sufficient (PS). The
AF508 mutation has been classified as a severe allele and, as
expected, patients homozygous for AF508 are almost certainly PI (3, 13).
To examine the clinical consequence of the mutations
described in this report, the clinical status of each individual
carrying these mutations was reviewed. Ten of the mutations

FIG. 2. Identification of the A1507 and AF508 alleles. (Upper)
The nucleotide sequence around the mutation sites. (Lower) Detecting the mutations by PAGE. The PCR products were prepared from
the three family members and separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel.
A DNA sample from a known heterozygous AF508 carrier is included
for comparison. The normal and mutant homoduplexes are poorly
separated in this assay system because the PCR products are 491 and
488 bp long, respectively; however, the two sequences may be easily
distinguished with shorter PCR products (11).

detected here (Q493X, A1507, 1717-1G -- A, G542X, S5491,

S549R, G551D, R560T, 3659delC, W1282X) were clearly
associated with the PI phenotype and should, therefore, be
classified as severe (as for AF508) according to our previous
classification (3). It is of interest to note that several patients
with both CF chromosomes carrying nonsense mutations
(e.g., G542X) were reported to have relatively mild lung
disease (although all PI as predicted) and that it was argued
that truncation or total absence of CFTR might be associated
with near normal lung function (ref. 20; H. Cuppens, P.
Marynen, C. De Boeck, F. Baets, E. Eggermont, H. Van den
Berghe, and J. J. Cassiman, unpublished data). Further studies are required to strengthen the latter argument, however,
because good pulmonary condition has also been detected in
a small number of patients homozygous for AF508 (13).
Two of the mutations, A455E and P574H, were detected in
PS patients. Since two PS patients with these mutations in
our study population are heterozygous for AF508, it is
reasonable to assume that A455E and P574H are both mild
alleles. A455E was also detected in a PS patient with the other
chromosome carrying an unknown mutation. The physiological consequence of Y563N could not be determined because
it was found in a PS patient with a yet unclassified mutation
in exon 14a (W864X; ref. 14). Obviously, additional case
studies will be necessary to clarify the clinical consequences
of carrying these potentially mild mutations.
Moreover, we have found a substitution of cysteine for
Phe-508 (F508C) in one patient who has typical symptoms of
CF with PI, whereas the amino acid substitution has been
found in at least two phenotypically normal individuals
carrying the AF508 on their other chromosome 7 (23). It is
possible that the F508C chromosome detected here carries an
additional mutation causing the disease. Alternatively, there
may be other genetic or environmental factors that contribute
to disease severity.
DNA Diagnosis. An immediate application for the information of the defined mutation sites is in CF diagnosis. For each
identified mutation, however, it will be essential to devise an
easy yet reliable screening procedure to confirm the observation and to estimate its frequency in various populations.
We previously suggested that the unique mobility of the
heteroduplexes formed between DNA fragments containing
the normal and AF508 alleles is a rapid, nonradioactive
method to detect carrier individuals (11). This method may
also be applied to AI507; as shown in Fig. 2, the banding
pattern of the PCR-amplified genomic DNA from the father,
who is the carrier with A1507, is clearly distinguishable from
that of the mother, who is typical of carriers with AF508.
It has become clear that, although AF508 accounts for
-70% of all CF chromosomes, the total number of diseasecausing mutations in the CF gene is likely to be large (refs. 12,
14, 16, 19, 24; this study and M. Schwarz, C. Summers, L.
Heptinstall, C. Newton, A. Markham, R. Cain, and M.
Super, unpublished data). In this study, while we have fully
analyzed >46% (2055/4440) of the coding region of the 31
non-AF508-carrying chromosomes in the Canadian family

collection for which the DNA marker haplotypes have been
determined (3), the mutations identified only account for 12
of these chromosomes (38%). Therefore, DNA-based population screening for CF carriers will be complicated by the
existence of a large number of different mutant alleles,
especially since some of them are expected to have markedly
different geographical (ethnic) distributions (4, 5, 12).
It is perhaps also important to point out the pitfalls of some
of the common means of DNA diagnosis. For example, both
S549N (12) and S5491 (this study) destroy the same Dde I site;
although both of them are disease-causing mutations in this
instance, the destruction of a restriction enzyme recognition
site is obviously not a reliable method to define a particular
mutation. ASO hybridization may also give false results;

A1507 could be mistaken as AF508 under low hybridization
stringency (ref. 3; this study). Allele-specific PCR has been
developed for AF508 (15) and several mutations described
here (Q493X, S549R, and 3659delC); this method usually
works well but it requires very careful temperature control to
distinguish different sequences. These examples illustrate
that extreme caution should be used with any DNA testing
procedure; testing of a large number of normal chromosomes,
particularly those of the same haplotypes, and quality control
should be mandatory before any broad-scale screening is
implemented. Furthermore, it has been suggested that broadscale population screening for CF carriers should not begin
until at least 95% of the mutations have been identified (21).
