Antithrombin I11 Basel is a hereditary abnormal an- (8).There are also hereditary abnormal antithrombins which

between antithrombin I11 Basel and normal antithrombin I11
should further help to elucidate the chemical nature of the
heparin binding site in antithrombin 111.
There are two major functional sites of antithrombin I11
involved in the heparin-enhanced antithrombin inhibition of
a-thrombin (1-3). The reactive site of human antithrombin
I11 which inhibits thrombinat itsactive site hasbeen recently
identified as anArg residue located at position 393 (4-6). The
heparin binding site which mediates the heparin-accelerated
antithrombin-thrombin reaction has been shown to contain
basic amino acids (3, 7) and tryptophan (8-lo), but itsprecise
chemical nature has not yet been unequivocally elucidated.
The heparin binding site of antithrombin I11 can be disturbed
by chemical modification (3, 7-9) without impairing the reactive site. For instance, chemical modification at a single
Trp residue (residue 49) in antithrombin I11 blocks heparin
binding and heparin-enhanced inhibition of thrombin without
altering the heparin-independent rate of thrombin inhibition

Antithrombin 111 Basel and normal antithrombin I11 from the
same patient were isolated and separated, at thefinal step by heparinagarose, as described (20). The purities of antithrombins were assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. DABITC’ was
obtained from Fluka. Other chemicals and solvents used in HPLC
analysis (21) and amino acid sequencing (22) were described elsewhere.
The amino termini of peptides and proteins were quantitatively
analyzed by the DABITC method (23).Peptides were isoalted by the
DABITC precolumn derivatization method (21). The amino acid
sequences of DABTC peptides were determined by the manual DABIC/phenylisothiocyanate method (22). Three nmol each of normal
and abnormal antithrombin I1 were oxidized by performic acid (24)
and digested by trypsin (Worthington, L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl
chloromethyl ketone-treated) in 150 p1 of 50 mM NHIHCO, at 37 “C

DABITC as described (21), dried, and redissolved in 100 p1 of 20%
aqueous pyridine. These samples were stored a t -20 “C andused for

DABTC peptide mapping (Fig. 2) and (iii) isolation of DABTC

RESULTS

Quantitative Amino-terminal Mappingof Tryptic Digests of
Normal and Abnormal Antithrombin ZZZ-The experiment
was undertaken to investigate the structural difference of
homologous proteinssurrounding the Arg/Lys-X residues.
Assuming quantitative trypsin digestion at each Arg/Lys-X
bond (Fig. I), any amino acid substitution at Arg/Lys positions or those immediately followArg/Lys should lead to
quantitative difference in the recoveries of amino-terminal
amino acids. This information is particularly useful here
because basic amino acids (3,7) have been shown to be crucial
for the heparin binding site of antithrombin 111. The results
(Fig. 1) show that the recoveries of amino-terminal amino
acids from tryptic digests of normal antithrombin I11 agree
closely with those calculated from the amino acid sequence
(25), and thereis no significant difference between the recoveries from both normal and abnormal antithrombin 111. A
substitution at position 47 (Arg) like antithrombin I11 Toyama (11)would result in a decrease of DABTH-Val.
DABTC Peptide Mapping of Normal and Abnormal Antithrombin ZZZ-DABTC peptides of oxidized and trypsin-digested normal and abnormal antithrombin I11 were first analyzedby RP-HPLC at the analytical level(5-10 pmol) in
order to find optimal conditions. With eight analytical runs
using varied chromatographic conditions (with different ionic
strength, pH of solvent A, and different gradient), only one
peptide difference was observed. Fig. 2 gives the conditions

found within a large peak eluted at 19.3 min and could be separated
by using higher ionic strength buffer A (35 mM). Conditions in this
analytical run were used for preparative isolation of the abnormal

Twenty microliters of the samples were injected for quantitative

for the corresponding amino acids. SAstands for DABTH dehydroserine and its recovery is included in the DABTH-Ser value. Numbers
under the chromatogram for abnormal antithrombin I11 are theoretical values calculated from the amino acid sequence of normal antithrombin 111. Numbers at the top of each peak represents recovery
calculated from the peak area and based on the recovery of DABTHAsn from normal antithrombin 111 as 1.0. The higher than anticipated
recoveries of DABTH-Ala and DABTH-Phe are due to a contaminant
in the protein sample and by-products from excess reagent, respectively.

selected for preparative isolation of the abnormal DABTC
peptide from antithrombin I11 Basal. Amino-terminal analysis
of the abnormal DABTC peptide (by direct incubation with
aqueous acid to release DABTH amino acid) (21) indicated
Ile as the amino-terminal residue (Fig. 3). Eight hundred
picomoles of this abnormal peptide were collected and sequenced by the manual DABITC/phenylisothiocyanate
method (22). The amino acid sequence (Fig. 4) indicates that
this abnormal peptide corresponds to residues 40-46 of normal antithrombin 111, with one substitution, Leu for Pro, at
position 41 (Fig. 5).
DISCUSSION

The molecular mechanism of the heparin-enhanced antithrombin-thrombin reaction is still a debated subject (1-3,
35). However, evidence from chemical and kinetic studies has
revealed that heparin function requires binding to both antithrombin and thrombin (3,7,26-31), and
the heparin binding
site of antithrombin and thrombin are both independent of
their active sites (7, 32, 33). Furthermore, the optimum heparin enhancingeffect occurs at approximately equimolar concentration of antithrombin/heparin/thrombin (29, 31).
