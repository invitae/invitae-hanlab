Summary: Deficiency of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) is
an important cause of sudden death in children. The majority of surviving
individuals with MCAD deficiency studied to date are homozygous for a single
point mutation at bp 985 of the MCAD mRNA (A985G). We have now
identified a four-base-pair deletion in exon 11 of one allele of the MCAD gene
in an American child who died of MCAD deficiency. The deletion mutation
results in a frameshift and premature termination codon in the mutant MCAD
mRNA. The second mutant allele contained the common point mutation
A985G, and thus the proband was a compound heterozygote. Protein immunoblot analysis of the child's liver proteins revealed that the mutant MCAD
proteins were barely detectable. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization
analysis performed on amplified exon 11 of the child's MCAD gene clearly
identified both mutations. MCAD R F L P analysis of the patient's DNA revealed
heterozygosity at the Taq I MCAD R F L P site, thus, the two mutations are
associated with different haplotypes. Therefore, we have identified a new
mutation in the MCAD gene and have developed a nucleic-acid-based screening
approach which allows the post mortem identification of MCAD deficiency.

The mitochondrial flavoenzyme medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD;
EC1.3.99.3) catalyses the initial reaction in fatty-acid/%oxidation. Inherited MCAD
deficiency (McKusick 201450) was first described in 1982 and is now recognized as
a common inborn error of metabolism (Kolvraa et al., 1982; Rhead et al., 1983). Clinical
manifestations of MCAD deficiency include hypoglycaemia, hepatic dysfunction, and
sudden death (Stanley et al., 1983; Duran et al., 1986). The clinical presentation is
usually precipitated by a period of fasting during the first 2 years of life, although the

initial onset, severity and frequency of clinical events are variable and unpredictable.
MCAD-deficient individuals may die suddenly or remain asymptomatic throughout
life. This disorder is often initially diagnosed as Reye syndrome or as Sudden Infant
Death Syndrome (SIDS) (Duran et al., 1986; Treem et al., 1986). Studies from Great
Britain indicate that MCAD deficiency occurs at a frequency of 1/12 000 to 1/15 000
births (Blakemore et aI., 1991a).
As the initial step in the molecular analysis of inherited MCAD deficiency, we
previously isolated and characterized clones encoding the human MCAD mRNA
and gene (Kelly et al., 1987). Recently, we and others have identified a crucial single
A--, G substitution at nucleotide position 985 (A985G) of the MCAD mRNA in
MCAD-deficient patients in the United States and Europe (Kelly et al., 1990;
Matsubara et al., 1990; Yokota et aI., 1990a,b; Gregersen et al., 1991). This point
mutation results in a glu a°4 for lys3°4 substitution in the mutant MCAD protein. In
addition, we have found that the A985G mutation is associated with an unusual
MCAD mRNA splicing abnormality (Kelly et al., 1990). Molecular screening tests
for the A985G mutation have been employed in both the United States and
Europe to analyse additional MCAD-deficient patients. To date, skin fibroblasts of
approximately 100 MCAD-deficient patients have been screened, revealing that over
85% of these individuals are homozygous for the A985G mutation (Blakemore et al.,
1991a; Kelly et al., 1990; Matsubara et al., 1990; Yokota et al., 1990a,b; Gregersen
et al., 1991; and unpublished results). The remaining patients have a single A985G
allele and may be compound heterozygotes.
We now report the characterization of the molecular defects, mutant MCAD
proteins, and MCAD RFLP haplotype in a child who died suddenly of MCAD
deficiency. Analysis of both mutant MCAD alleles in the proband revealed two
different mutations; a new deletion mutation in exon 11 and the common A985G point
mutation. Allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization analyses specifically
identified both mutations in a single amplified fragment of DNA, and RFLP analyses
revealed that the mutations are associated with different haplotypes. This work was
presented in part at the National Meeting of the Society of Pediatric Research, April
1991, New Orleans, USA.
METHODS

Clinical history and diagnostic tests: The index patient, M.R., a Caucasian male,
was born in the southern United States at term. The child developed mild transient
respiratory distress which resolved quickly. At age 3 months, he was treated with
antibiotics for otitis media and subsequently developed diarrhoea and vomiting.
Progressive lethargy prompted hospital admission. Initial laboratory analysis revealed
serum glucose of 31 mg/dl, ammonia of 145 mg/dl, elevated liver transaminases, and
no detectable urine ketones. He was treated with intravenous fluids and dextrose
with complete recovery. He did well, with normal growth and development, until
age 22 months, when he presented to an outside hospital with seizures, coma,
hypoglycaemia, and hyperammonaemia. He was treated with intravenous fluids and
dextrose but developed progressive cerebral oedema which caused brain death.

Autopsy results revealed severe ischaemic encephalopathy, uncal herniation, and
prominent hepatic steatosis with intracellular lipid droplets. Liver mitochondria were
rounded and showed no membrane irregularities. The mitochondrial matrix was
granular and somewhat rarified but no inclusions were noted.
Laboratory studies during the second hospitalization revealed moderate to large
amounts of urinary adipic, suberic and sebacic acids without ketones. Plasma amino
acids were low, consistent with protein restriction.
The patient's parents were healthy and had no history suggestive of a fatty-acid
oxidation defect. The ethnic origin of the parents is unknown, both were born in the
United States. There is no known history of consanguinity.
Enzymatic assays of the straight-chain acyt-CoA dehydrogenases (ACD): The assays
were performed as described previously (Frerman and Goodman, 1985) on post
mortem liver tissue (patient) or cultured skin fibroblasts (patient's mother and normal
controls), employing electron-transfer flavoprotein (ETF) as the electron acceptor.
Isolation of genomic DNA, amplification and characterization of the index patient's
MCAD gene exon 11: Genomic DNA was isolated from the post mortem liver tissue
of patient M.R. and from the blood of normal individuals, using standard techniques
(Sambrook et al., 1989). Genomic DNA (2 pg) served as the template for amplification
of the entire MCAD exon 11 by employing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers
designed from the MCAD gene sequences flanking intron 10 and ti as determined
in our laboratory (Zhang et al., in press); the 5' primer contained a Barn HI site (5'gttggatccagaccagcctggcaacatagc-3') and the 3' primer contained an Eco RI site (5'ttatgaattctattctatctccttgcaaa-Y). The amplification was carried out in a Perkin-Elmer
Cetus thermocycler for 40 cycles using Taq polymerase and previously described
protocol (Kelly et aI., 1990). The amplified DNA was subjected to alMe-specific
oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization analysis and subcloned into pGEM plasmid
vectors (Promega) via the Barn HI and Eco RI restriction sites. The ASO hybridization
analysis was performed as described previously with oligonucleotide primers for the
A985G mutation (Kelly et al., 1990) and for the Al100-1103 deletion (see Results).
The plasmid subclones were subjected to DNA sequence analysis by the dideoxy
chain-termination technique. The entire nucleotide sequence of the DNA insert within
each subclone was determined.
Protein immunoblot analysis of the normal and index patient's liver extract: The
human liver extract was prepared as described previously (Kelly et al., t987). Extract
(25/zg) from normal post mortem liver and from the index patient's liver was separated
by 12.5% SDS-PAGE along with 10 ng of purified porcine liver MCAD. The proteins
were transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized with anti-porcine MCAD.
Genomic southern blotting and determination of the M CAD gene Taq I sequence: Genomic DNA isolated from the patient, a normal individual, and a known homozygous
G 985 individual were used for genomic Southern blotting. Genomic DNA from the
index patient and a normal individual with a known Taq I RFLP haplotype

(homozygous for allele 1) served as the template for the amplification of a 180-bp
fragment within the MCAD gene which contains the informative RFLP Taq I site.
The amplified DNA was subcloned into pGEM plasmid vectors and subjected to
DNA sequence analysis.

RESULTS
The index patient's clinical history and laboratory studies were consistent with the
diagnosis of a defect in fatty-acid oxidation. All acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities
were low in the patient's liver; however, MCAD activity was less than half of LCAD
activity. This is in contrast to normal liver, in which MCAD activity exceeds LCAD
3-fold (Stanley et al., 1983). This enzyme activity profile is consistent with MCAD
deficiency. Medium-chain dicarboxylic aciduria further supported the diagnosis. The
diagnosis was confirmed by demonstrating that the mother was heterozygous for
M CAD deficiency in fibroblasts (mother 2.16 nmolmin-1 (mg protein)-~; normal
mean ( _+ SD) controls 4.17 _4_-0.37; MCAD heterozygotes 2.24 + 0.43). LCAD activity
was normal in maternal fibroblasts.
DNA isolated from the child's post m o r t e m liver served as template for the
amplification of exon 11 of the MCAD gene. The amplified DNA was used in an
allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) analysis with oligonucleotide probes described
previously (Kelly et al., 1990), containing either the A 985 (normal allele) o r G 985
(common mutant allele). A signal was present with both oligonucleotide probes,
indicating that the child was heterozygous at the 985 locus (data not shown). To
confirm the results of the ASO hybridization analysis and as an initial step in the
identification of the second mutation, the amplified MCAD exon 11 DNA from the
index patient was subcloned into ptasmid vectors and 10 subclones were subjected
to DNA sequence analysis. Exon 11 was chosen because it contains the only other
reported mutation in MCAD deficiency (Yokota et al., 1990a,b). Three of the 10
subclones contained the A985G mutation. Seven of the 10 subclones contained a
normal A at position 985 and a 4-bp deletion (5'-agtt-3') of MCAD mRNA positions
1100-1104 (Figure 1). The three clones with the A985G mutation did not contain
the 4-bp deletion. Thus, the patient was heterozygous for both the c o m m o n G 985
mutation and a 4-bp deletion (All00-t 103) in exon 11 of the MCAD gene.
To confirm the sequencing results and to develop a practical molecular screening
approach for the 4-bp deletion, an ASO hybridization analysis was performed on the
amplified DNA fragment of the index patient's MCAD exon 11 DNA employing 16base oligonucleotides spanning the 1100-1103 region which were specific either for
the normal allele (5'-caaatcagttagctac-3') or for the allele containing the 4-bp deletion
(5'-tgcaaatcagctactg-Y). The hybridization was also performed on DNA amplified
from a normal individual (Figure 2). The deletion mutant oligonucleotide gave a
signal only with the index patient's amplifed DNA and not with the normal amplified
DNA, whereas the normal probe gave signals with both the normal and mutant
amplified DNA. Therefore, the ASO hybridization also demonstrated that the patient
is a compound heterozygote for the A985G mutation and a 1100-1103 deletion in

exon 11 of the MCAD gene. Moreover, the new mutation can be detected by a PCRbased molecular screening approach with ASO analysis.
The All00-1103 mutation predicts a frame-shifted, truncated mutant MCAD
protein. The frame-shift begins at amino acid 369 of the mutant MCAD protein and
truncates at amino acid position 385 (Figure 3). Therefore, the mutant protein would
contain an altered region of 16 amino acids and would be 36 amino acids shorter
than the normal precursor MCAD protein. Previous studies indicate that glu 376 of
the mature MCAD protein is the a-proton-abstracting base in catalysis (Powell and
Thorpe, 1988; Bross et al., 1990). Therefore, the truncated mutant MCAD protein
encoded by the deletion mutant allele would lack domains involved in substrate
binding and catalytic function.
To determine the size and steady-state levels of the mutant proteins, we performed
immunoblot analysis on a protein extract of the child's post mortem liver tissue. As
shown in Figure 4, there is no detectable MCAD antigen at the expected normal
size. A faint signal is present at a size of approximately 4000-5000 daltons smaller
than the expected MCAD signal. The size of this faint band correlates with the
predicted size of the mutant MCAD protein encoded by the A1100-1103 allele. As
we have shown previously, the immunodetectable level of the glu 3°4 MCAD mutant
protein is decreased to undetectable levels in liver tissue (Kelly et al., 1990). Therefore,
this newly identified mutant All00-1103 MCAD gene and the A985G mutant
MCAD gene encode proteins which are degraded in post mortem liver tissue.
Recent studies have shown that the G 98s mutation is linked to a single R F L P
haptotype defined by three restriction sites; Ban II (allele 1), Pst I (allele 1), and Taq
I (allele 2) (Kiddet al., 1990; Blakemore et al., 1991; Kolvraa et al., 1991). A 5.0-kb
Taq I (allele 2) fragment is most informative because its frequency is only 0.21 in the
European and US populations, yet it is uniformly associated with the G 985 mutation.
Genomic Southern blotting experiments employing a 1138-bp EcoRI-Hind III M CAD
cDNA fragment probe containing regions encoded by exons 8-12, demonstrated that
the index patient is homozygous for the common MCAD R F L P haplotype Ban IIallele 1/Pst I-allele 1 (data not shown). We have recently determined the location of
the polymorphic Taq I site within the MCAD gene and developed PCR primers

designed to amplify across this site (unpublished data). To determine the Taq I R F L P
haplotype of the index patient, the PCR primers were employed with genomic DNA
isolated from the index patient and a rlormal individual known to be homozygous
for the presence of the Taq I site by previous genomic Southern blotting studies. The
amplifed DNA was subcloned into plasmid vectors and the DNA sequence across
the Taq I R F L P site determined. The normal DNA contained only subclones with
the Taq I site sequence, 5'-tcga-3'. Subclones derived from the patient contained
either the 5'-taga-3' or 5'-tcga-3' at the polymorphic site. The remainder of the
nucleotide sequence of the 180-bp fragment of amplified DNA derived from the index
patient was identical to the sequence of the amplified normal DNA. These data
demonstrate that G 985 and the A1100-1103 deletion are not linked to the same Taq
I R F L P allele.

DISCUSSION
Inherited MCAD deficiency is one of the few known causes of sudden death in
children. Affected children develop normally and are asymptomatic between episodes;
however, during a fasting stress, acute decompensation may occur with disastrous
results. Development of a practical screening approach would allow detection of
carriers and affected persons. Preliminary studies reveal that the single mutation
A985G may be sufficiently common for molecular screening to be useful in

presymptomatic recognition of MCAD deficiency (Blakemore et al., 1991b; Kelly et
al., 1990; Matsubara et al., 1990; Yokota et al., 1990a,b; Gregersen et al., 1991).
However, molecular screening of MCAD-deficient sudden-death victims has not been
reported and the molecular heterogeneity of MCAD deficiency within this clinical
subgroup is unknown. In this report we have completely characterized the molecular
basis of MCAD deficiency in a child who died suddenly, identified a new mutation
responsible for MCAD deficiency, and developed a post mortem nucleic-acid-based
screening method.
The proband was heterozygous for the common A985G mutation and a 4-bp
deletion (A 1100-1103) within exon 11 of the MCAD gene. The Atl00-1103 deletion
is only the second reported naturally occurring mutation in the MCAD gene, other
than the A985G. The other previously published mutation is a 13-bp duplication at
position 900 of the MCAD mRNA in a Spanish child (Yokota et at., 1990a, b).
Interestingly, all three mutations are located within exon 11 of the MCAD gene. The
similar location of the three mutations may reflect a more intense study of exon 11
than other locations, although recent data indicate that this region of the MCAD
gene is quite polymorphic and, thus, mutations may occur more frequently in this
exon (Blakemore et aI., 1991b; and unpublished results).
The At100-1103 mutation results in a flame-shifted, truncated mutant MCAD
protein. This protein lacks the domain containing glu 3~6 which is crucial for substrate
binding and catalytic function (Powell and Thorpe, 1988; Bross et al., 1990). In
addition, protein immunoblot studies reveal that the level of this mutant MCAD
protein was markedly reduced as compared to the level in non-MCAD-deficient post
mortem liver (Figure 4). The glu 3°4 mutant protein is also barely detectable in post
mortem liver tissue, although normal levels Of this mutant protein are observed in
skin fibroblasts in culture (Kelly et al., 1990). Therefore, it is possible that these
mutant proteins were degraded rapidly in MCAD-deficient livers and that the
truncated MCAD protein would be detectable in mammalian cells in culture. We
are currently expressing the Al100-1103 mutant protein in mammalian cells in
culture to allow enzymological analysis of functional characteristics, such as flavin
binding and tetramer formation.
MCAD RFLP analysis revealed that the patient described here is heterozygous at
the Taq I locus (allele 1/allele 2) and thus Al100-1103 is not linked to the same
haplotype as G 985. Recent studies have shown that a single MCAD RFLP haplotype
(Bam II-allele 1, Pst I-allele 1, Taq I-allele 2) is uniformly associated with the G 985
allele, yet this haplotype is only present in 20% of the normal population (Kiddet
aI., 1990; Kolvraa et al., 1991). Based on the known association of G 985 with the Taq
I-allele 2 RFLP, it is likely that the Taq I-allele 1 is linked to ALI00-1103 in this
patient, although familial analysis would be necessary to confirm this linkage. Our
data also reveal that, at least in this patient, the molecular basis of the informative
Taq I polymorphism is a single base difference as opposed to major DNA
rearrangements in the intron.
The molecular screening approach described here allows the post mortem identification of MCAD deficiency in sudden-death victims. Post mortem characterization

Europe will define the heterogeneity of the mutation responsible for MCAD-deficient
patients dying suddenly, and will provide insight into the molecular genetic origins
of this disease.

Note added in proof: During preparation of this manuscript for publication, the
11O0-1103 MCAD deletion mutation described herein was also identified in a second
unrelated MCAD-deficient individual by Dr. Y. T. Chen and co-workers (Duke
University) and five MCAD gene point mutations, in addition to the G 985 and 11001103 deletion mutations, were reported (Am. J. Hum. Genet. 49 (1991) 1280-1291).

rDA, ribosome biogenesis: synthesis of ribosomal proteins and ribosome formation.
This is a useful monograph for basic scientists on relatively underdocumented
areas. Unfortunately it lacks a subject index but the contents list is detailed enough
for reader' guidance. There are useful summaries to each review.
