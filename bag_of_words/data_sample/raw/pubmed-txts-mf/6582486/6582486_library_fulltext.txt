ABSTRACT
Structural analyses of a hereditary abnormal
antithrombin III, antithrombin III Toyama, which has normal
progressive antithrombin activity but no heparin cofactor activity, have been carried out to elucidate the molecular abnormality causing recurrent thrombophlebitis of a patient and to
identify an amino acid residue essential for the binding with
heparin. Abnormal antithrombin III was reduced, S-pyridylethylated, and treated with cyanogen bromide. Eleven fragments were isolated by the combination of Sephadex G-50 gel
filtration and reversed-phase HPLC and compared with those
from normal antithrombin III. One large fragment (CN-III)
that appeared to have a different amino acid composition from
that of the corresponding fragment from normal antithrombin
mI was digested with trypsin, and the digests were separated
by HPLC. The abnormal peptide was identified by comparing
the peptide map with that from normal antithrombin Ill. Amino acid sequence analysis of the abnormal peptide indicated
that the arginine-47 of normal antithrombin III had been replaced by cysteine in antithrombin HI Toyama. One base mutation, C -- T, in the 5' terminal position of the arginine-47
genetic codon (CGT) is probably responsible for this substitution. These results also suggest that arginine-47 is an essential
amino acid residue for the binding with heparin.

gote transmitted from heterozygous parents. The antithrombin III antigen concentration in her plasma was as high as 54
mg/dl and the progressive antithrombin activity assayed in
the absence of heparin was of normal level, but the heparin
cofactor activity of her plasma was as low as 26% of the
normal (15). This value of the heparin cofactor activity in her
plasma is probably due to heparin cofactor II (17), since
crossed immunoelectrophoresis in the presence of heparin in
the first-dimension agarose gel showed that her antithrombin
III apparently has no heparin-binding ability (16). These results suggest that the abnormality in the patient's antithrombin III is occurring at the heparin-binding site of the inhibitor, whereas the reactive site is intact and functional.
Abnormal antithrombin III has been purified from the patient's plasma and the following properties have been established (18). (i) Antithrombin III Toyama, like normal antithrombin III, is a single-chain glycoprotein; it has the same
molecular weight, amino-terminal amino acid sequence, and
carboxyl-terminal amino acid as normal antithrombin III;
and the two proteins are immunologically identical. These
results indicate that the functional abnormality of antithrombin III Toyama is not caused by loss of the terminal part of
the polypeptide chain. (ii) Antithrombin III Toyama has the
same UV absorption spectrum as normal antithrombin III,
suggesting that neither tryptophan nor tyrosine residues are
replaced by other amino acids. (iii) Antithrombin III Toyama
migrates to the anode faster than normal antithrombin III on
agarose gel electrophoresis (pH 8.6), and this difference in
mobility is unchanged after a sialidase digestion. These results suggest that, in antithrombin III Toyama, an amino acid
residue at the heparin-binding site has been replaced by a
less-basic or more-acidic one that has no ability to interact
with heparin.
In this paper, we present the evidence that arginine-47 has
been replaced by cysteine in antithrombin III Toyama, resulting in the total loss of heparin-binding ability.

Human antithrombin III is a single-chain a2-glycoprotein in
plasma that is composed of 432 amino acid residues (1, 2).
The glycoprotein forms a stoichiometric enzyme-inhibitor
complex with a wide variety of serine proteases involved in
the coagulation and the fibrinolysis systems and plays a principal role in regulation of the hemostatic mechanism (3, 4).
The primary contact site (reactive site) of antithrombin III
with proteases in the complex formation has been identified
as Arg-Ser near the carboxyl terminus of the inhibitor (5, 6).
Antithrombin III strongly binds heparin, which greatly accelerates the reaction rate of the inhibitor with proteases (3,
4). One tryptophan (4) and one or more lysine (7) residues (or
both) of antithrombin III have been suggested to be involved
in the binding with heparin, although their locations in the
amino acid sequence have not been assigned.
In 1965, Egeberg (8) described a thrombophilic family having a hereditary antithrombin III deficiency and, in 1974, Sas
et al. (9) described a family with a thrombolism due to abnormal antithrombin III. Since then, several reports have been
presented on the familial antithrombin III abnormality associated with thromboembolic disorder (10-15).
Recently, we identified a Japanese family having the abnormal antithrombin III "antithrombin III Toyama" (16).
The propositus of this family was a 23-year-old female suffering from recurrent thrombophlebitis. She was a homozy-

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of Homozygous Abnormal Antithrombin III.
Antithrombin III Toyama was purified by immunoadsorption chromatography on anti-antithrombin III-Sepharose followed by DEAE-Sephadex A-50 chromatography (18). Normal antithrombin III was purified as previously described

(19).

Fragmentation of Antithrombin III by Treatment with Cyanogen Bromide and Isolation of Fragment CN-III. Normal
and abnormal antithrombin III were reduced and S-pyridylethylated (19). The S-pyridylethylated proteins were degraded with cyanogen bromide and the resulting fragments were
fractionated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 followed by
HPLC. The HPLC conditions were the same as described

below for the peptide mapping except that the linear gradient
of 5-60% acetonitrile was run in 20 min instead of in 40 min.
Tryptic Digestion and Peptide Mapping by HPLC. The fragment (normal or abnormal CN-III; 3.6 or 3.0 mg, respectively) was dissolved in 300 1.d of 0.05 M Tris-HCl/0.15 M
NaCl/10 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0, and 100 /il of L-1-tosylamido-2phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin-Sepharose
CL-4B suspension (1 mg of trypsin/ml of suspension) was
added. After incubation at 250C with constant vibration for
24 hr, the digestion mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant was chromatographed on a reversed-phase C18 column
(0.4 x 30 cm; TSK LS-410K ODS SIL; Toyo Soda, Tokyo,
Japan) using a Hitachi model 638 liquid chromatograph.
HPLC was carried out at 250C with a linear gradient of 560% acetonitrile in 10 mM ammonium formate (pH 4.0) in 40
min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min and the eluate was monitored by measuring absorbance at 220 nm. Peptides that
passed through the column were rechromatographed on the
same column after equilibrating it with 10 mM ammonium
formate (pH 4.0). A gradient of 0-5% acetonitrile in the
equilibration buffer was run in 20 min at a flow rate of 1
ml/min. The isolated peptides were lyophilized and used for
amino acid and sequence analyses.
Amino Acid Analysis and Sequence Determination. Amino
acid analyses were performed by the method of Moore and
Stein (20) on a JEOL-6AS amino acid analyzer. Performic
acid oxidation was carried out as described by Hirs (21) and
free sulfhydryl group was determined by Ellman's method
(22). Amino acid sequences were determined by manual Edman degradation (23). Phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were
identified as described (18) and also by HPLC on a 30-cm
Waters ,uBondapak C18 column using stepwise elution with a
system of methanol-containing buffers (Waters Associates).
RESULTS
Separation of Cyanogen Bromide Fragments of Normal and
Abnormal Antithrombin III and Isolation of the CN-III Fragments. The elution profiles of cyanogen bromide fragments
of S-pyridylethylated abnormal and normal antithrombin III
from a Sephadex G-50 column are shown in Fig. 1. Pooled
fractions II, III, IV, V, and VIII contained mostly fragments
CN-II, CN-III, CN-IV, CN-V, and CN-VIII, respectively,
with small amounts of contaminating fragments, which were
removed by HPLC. Pooled fractions VI, VII, and IX were
further separated by HPLC into two components each, fragments CN-VI-1 and -2, CN-VII-1 and -2, and CN-IX-1 and
-2. Eleven cyanogen bromide fragments were finally obtained from abnormal antithrombin III as well as from normal antithrombin III. Amino acid compositions of the purified cyanogen bromide fragments of abnormal antithrombin
III are shown in Table 1. The total amino acid composition of
the 11 cyanogen bromide fragments closely accounts for that
of intact antithrombin III. Identities between the smaller
fragments, CN-V, CN-VI-1 and -2, CN-VII-1 and -2, CNVIII, and CN-IX-1 and -2, from abnormal antithrombin III
and the corresponding fragments from normal antithrombin
III were determined from their similar amino acid compositions and HPLC retention times. However, it was difficult to
determine the identity or difference between the larger fragments, CN-II, CN-III, and CN-IV, from abnormal antithrombin III and the corresponding normal antithrombin III
fragments by comparing only the amino acid compositions
and HPLC retention times.
Tryptic Peptide Mapping of Large Cyanogen Bromide Fragments. To further investigate the structural difference between abnormal and normal antithrombin III, the three large

cyanogen bromide fragments from abnormal antithrombin

III were digested with trypsin and each digest was subjected
to HPLC to compare the peptide map with that of the corresponding fragment from normal antithrombin III. There was

FIG. 1. Separation of cyanogen bromide fragments of S-pyridylethylated abnormal (A) and normal (B) antithrombin III by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50. S-Pyridylethylated abnormal or normal antithrombin III (26 or 30 mg, respectively) was treated with 60 mg of
cyanogen bromide (100-fold molar excess over methionine residues)
in 2.5 ml of 70% formic acid. The reaction mixture was incubated for
24 hr at 40C, then diluted with 9 vol of distilled water and lyophilized. A column (2.6 x 95 cm) of Sephadex G-50 was equilibrated
with 0.1 M formic acid. (A) Cyanogen bromide-treated abnormal
antithrombin III (26 mg) was applied to the column and eluted at a
flow rate of 6 ml/hr; 2-ml fractions were collected. (B) Cyanogen
bromide-treated normal antithrombin III (30 mg) was applied to the
column and eluted at a flow rate of 5.4 ml/hr; 1.8-ml fractions were
collected. Eluates were monitored by measuring the absorbance at
230 (o) and 280 (e) nm. Fractions indicated by bars and roman numerals were pooled. The last broad peak detected at 230 nm in A
was mainly due to the more concentrated formic acid added to dissolve the abnormal antithrombin III sample.

no significant difference in the peptide maps of fragments
CN-II and CN-IV from abnormal and normal antithrombin
III. However, two distinctive features were observed when
the chromatograms of the CN-III fragments from abnormal
and normal antithrombin III were compared (Fig. 2A). (i)
The chromatogram of the tryptic digest of CN-III from normal antithrombin III had the largest peptide T-7t-containing
peak whereas that of the tryptic digest of CN-III from abnormal antithrombin III had the largest peptide T-X-containing
peak, and that peak was completely absent from the former
chromatogram. (ii) The retention time of peptide T-Xa was
slightly but reproducibly different from that of peptide T-7a.
tIn addition to peptide T-7, this peak contained an unidentifiable
peptide that was identical to the component of the corresponding
peak in the chromatogram of the tryptic digest of CN-III from abnormal antithrombin III.

these multiple peaks for a single peptide. All of these peptides but two could be unambiguously aligned in the known

that of peptide T-X. However, the sequence Val-Trp-GluLeu-Ser-Lys is the same as that of peptide T-7, which corresponds to the valine-48 to lysine-53 sequence in normal antithrombin III. The preceding residue (no. 47) in normal antithrombin III is arginine, which was obtained as peptide T-6
only in the tryptic peptides of CN-III from normal antithrombin III. These results suggest that peptide T-X from abnormal antithrombin III corresponds to peptides T-6 and T-7
from normal antithrombin III, thus identifying the replacement of arginine-47 by cysteine in abnormal antithrombin
III.
Form of Cysteine-47 in Abnormal Antithrombin III. No
free sulfhydryl groups could be detected in abnormal antithrombin III by Ellman's method but a total of 8.2 mol of
cysteic acid per mol of protein was found by amino acid analysis when performic acid-oxidized abnormal antithrombin
III was directly hydrolyzed in 6 M HCl whereas a total of 7
mol of PeCys was recovered in the cyanogen bromide fragments of abnormal antithrombin III (Table 1). These results
suggest that the sulfhydryl group of cysteine-47 in abnormal
antithrombin III forms a disulfide bond with 1 mol of free
cysteine, since normal antithrombin III contains 6 mol of
half-cystine residues as three disulfide bonds. A previous paper from this laboratory reported the same disulfide bond
form of a cysteine residue in a1-antitrypsin (25).

DISCUSSION
In this paper, we present structural evidence for the abnormality of antithrombin III Toyama that caused a Japanese
patient to suffer from recurrent thrombophlebitis. In the proposed classification of antithrombin III deficiencies (12), antithrombin III Toyama, as described (15), belongs to type
III, in which the heparin cofactor activity of antithrombin III
is reduced but the progressive antithrombin activity and the
plasma level of the antithrombin III antigen are normal.
Type III deficiency, therefore, shows the physiological importance of the heparin-binding ability of antithrombin III.
In the present study, we identified the amino acid substitution in antithrombin III Toyama as cysteine for arginine-47 in
normal antithrombin III. Since the genetic codon for arginine-47 has been determined as CGT (1), we conclude that
the patient's genomic DNA coding antithrombin III has a
TGT nucleotide sequence; i.e., the single base mutation of
cytosine to thymidine in the 5'-terminal position of the codon
for arginine-47 in the patient's genomic DNA is responsible
for this hereditary disorder.
The amino acid residues involved in the primary contact
site (reactive site) of antithrombin III with proteases in the
complex formation have been established as arginine-393
and serine-394 (5, 6), but the amino acid residue(s) involved
in the heparin-binding site have not been identified. Antithrombin III Toyama, which has completely lost its heparinbinding ability because of the change of a single amino acid
residue in the polypeptide, gives us integral evidence for
identification of the amino acid residue that is essential for
the binding of antithrombin III with heparin. The present
study suggests that arginine-47 in normal antithrombin III is
the putative amino acid residue that interacts directly with
heparin. Loss of one positive charge at the heparin-binding
site because of the arginine-to-cysteine substitution prevents
antithrombin III Toyama from ionic binding with heparin
through the sulfate or the carboxyl group of the mucopolysaccharide. As shown in the sequence study of peptide T-X
and by the known sequence of antithrombin III (Fig. 3), a
tryptophan residue is located at position 49, only two residues from arginine-47. This tryptophan-49 may be the one
that has been suggested by chemical modification (4) to be
involved in the heparin-binding site in antithrombin III.

Recently, we determined the amino-terminal sequence of
a plasma histidine-rich glycoprotein that has a heparin-binding ability comparable with that of antithrombin III and
showed that the sequence is homologous to the sequence in
the amino-terminal region (arginine-24 to arginine-46) of antithrombin III, for which no other homologous proteins
could be found in the data base of protein sequences (26).
From these observations, we suggested that the heparinbinding sites of the two plasma proteins are located in the
amino-terminal portion where the sequences of the two proteins are homologous. The present finding of the arginine-tocysteine substitution at position 47 from the amino terminus
of antithrombin III Toyama, which lacks heparin-binding
ability, supports our proposal.
