For
several
decades
the investigation
of the functional
properties
of enzymes
relied
primarily
on kinetic
studies,
but
more recently
the primary
structure
of the protein
has been
elucidated
in many cases, and for a few, considerable
amounts
of information
on the three-dimensional
structure
is also
available.
In some instances,
perhaps
best typified
by lysozyme,
knowledge
of the structure
has yielded
almost
immediate insight
into the mechanism
of substrate
binding

therefore
of enzyme
action
(2). In other cases, such as that of
the quasi-enzyme,
hemoglobin,
a combination
of structural,
chemical
and functional
data is leading
to an understanding
of
important
properties
of the molecule,
such as cooperativity
and
the Bohr
effect
(3, 4). Further,
a comparative
analysis
of
various
homologous
molecular
species
which
differ
in very
limited
portions
of the protein
has shown that it is possible
to
attribute
specific
functional
and reactivity
differences
to
known
structural
differences
(5, 6). While
this approach
has
been very
fruitful
with
hemoglobins,
whether
from
different
animal
species
or from
mutant
subjects
within
the same
species,
it has been hardly
explored
in the case of an enzyme.
In view
of previous
data,
which
indicate
that
genetically
different
types
of glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase
from
human
erythrocytes
confer
different
metabolic
properties
on
the red cell (7-lo),
we have
decided
to investigate
further
whether
a comparative
analysis
of kinetic
and thermodynamic
parameters
of these variants
will help to elucidate
the catalytic
function
of the enzyme.
In this paper we present
data on the

The values
of V,,,,, and K, for the three genetic
variants
A, B, and A- of erythrocyte
glucose-&phosphate dehydrogenase
have been determined
at 10 different
pH values in the range from 5.5 to 9.5, and at
four different
temperatures
in the range from 18.5-40.0”.
The log V,,,,, versus pH curve for each of the
enzymes
shows a monotonic
increase
between
pH 5.5 and 7, and a plateau
from pH 7.5 upwards.
These
curves,
and their temperature
dependence,
are compatible
with the presence
of a single ionizable
group
which,
in its conjugate
acid form, renders
the enzyme’substrate
complex
inactive.
The pK of this group is
6.94 at 18.5”, and its enthalpy
of ionization
is 7.0 kcal mol-‘.
The log K, IJ~~SZLS pH curves show a broad
plateau
between
pH 6.2 and 8.2, interrupted
by a sharp minimum
at pH 7.2 for variant
B, while variants
A and A- show sharp maxima
at pH 7.2 and 7.45, respectively.
It is proposed
that this unusual
behavior
depends
on the dissociation
of the tetrameric
enzyme
to dimers
in this pH region.
Specifically,
it is shown
that a sharp maximum
or minimum
of K, can arise if cooperative
uptake
or release of protons
is linked to
dimer
formation,
and if the degree
of cooperativity
is different
for the free enzyme
compared
to the
enzyme.substrate
complex.
The pH dependence
of the equilibrium
between
the tetrameric
and the
dimeric
form of the enzyme
has been determined
by gel filtration
for the same three genetic variants
B, A,
and A-. In agreement
with previous
ultracentrifugal
data, the enzyme
is a tetramer
in acid solution
and a
dimer in alkaline
solution.
The pH at which half of the enzyme
is in dimeric
form, under our experimental
conditions,
is 7.15 * 0.05 for variants
A and B, and 7.35 i 0.05 for variant
A-. These
pH values
correspond
closely,
for all three variants,
to the sharp extrema
in the pH dependence
of their K, values
for glucose
6-phosphate.
From
the measured
dissociation
equilibria,
it can be inferred
that
the
tetramer-dimer
transition
entails
cooperative
release
of protons.
The degree of cooperativity
estimated
from these data agrees closely with the independent
estimate
based on the pH dependence
of K,.

of’ the substrate,

by three variants
of’ glucose-6-phosphate

commonly
regarded
as having
normal
activity,
namely
the normal
type B, ’
the type
A which
is commonly
found
in Nigeria,
and the
variant
A-, one of those associated
with the so-called
deficiency of glucose-6.phosphate
dehydrogenase.
We have found
that while the general
pattern
of enzyme-substrate
interaction
is very
similar
for the three
types,
significant
and specific
differences
can be detected
in the pH region
close to the
intracellular
pH of’ the erythrocyte.
In that region,
each of the
variants
exhibits
a very sharp minimum
or maximum
of K,,
which
is characteristically
different
in each variant.
We show
that this peculiar
pH dependence
might
be due to cooperativity of proton
binding
coupled
to the transition
of the enzyme
from a tetrameric
to a dimeric
form.
We thus provide
evidence
that point mutations
can affect the state of aggregation
of the
enzyme
molecule.

ml of enzyme
solution
preincubated
at the same temperature.
All
volumes were measured with an Agla micrometer
syringe. The concentration of the stock enzyme solution was always adjusted by dilution
with 0.05 M Tris-borate
buffer,
pH 8.0, so as to give a V,,, of
approximately
0.06 4AA,,, min’
at the particular
pH and temperature
being used. For the determination
of V,,, the reaction mixture
was:
buffer, 0.2 ml; 5 rnM NADP+,
0.03 ml; 0.05 M Glc-6-P,
0.06 ml; and
enzyme solution, 0.01 ml. pH values were measured with a Radiometer
model 4 pH-meter
at the appropriate
temperature
on separate solutions of identical
composition.
The pH values thus obtained,
and not
the nominal
pH of the buffer, were used in recording
results. After
allowing the reaction to proceed for 5 min (more than the time required
to determine
reaction velocity)
the pH was rechecked.
It was found
that it decreased from the initial value by less than 0.02 in the pH
range from 5.9 to 8.6, and by less than 0.05 above pH 8.6.
Gel Filtration
Experiments-These
were performed
in Sephadex
G-200, previously
equilibrated
with Tris-borate
buffer (I = 0.01) of the
desired pH and carefully
packed by gravity,
under a hydrostatic
pressure of 20 cm of H,O, in a column (60 x 1.7 cm) having a volume of
87 ml. The void volume was 32.5 ml. Units of enzyme solution (1 ‘1~ to
2) were applied to the column in a volume of 1.0 ml, to which human
hemoglobin
had been added, and elution was carried out at 4’ with the
same buffer in which the column was packed, with a flow rate of 4 to 5
ml/hour.
Fractions
(1 ml) were collected,
and tested for enzyme
activity
and optical density at 415 nm. All chromatographic
runs were
carried
out using the same column.
The elution
volume
of the
hemoglobin
marker was 63 * 1.5 ml in a series of 20 runs, and it did not
vary systematically
with pH. All elution profiles were aligned according to the positions of the hemoglobin
peak, and the elution volume of
glucose-6.phosphate
dehydrogenase,
V,, was read off the individual
graphs (see Fig. 8).
Reagents-All
reagents were of analytical
grade. Enzyme substrates
were from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO; ammonium
sulfate was
from Schwa&Mann,
Orangeburg,
N. Y.

Preparations-Glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase
was
obtained
from human erythrocytes
in a highly purified form according
to techniques
previously
described (12-~15). The final specific activities
of the preparations
used for kinetic experiments
were greater than 120
i.u./mg of protein.
All preparations
were dialyzed
before use against
0.05 M Tris-borate
buffer, pH 8.0, containing
0.1 rnM EDTA and 10 PM
NADP.
pH and Ionic Stren@h-Data
from a previous
study (16) indicate
that most of the buffers commonly
used in the study of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
do not have sufficient
buffering
capacity throughout the pH region of interest, or that they affect the enzyme reaction
by the nature of the ions present, or both. However,
it was established
that citrate, borate, Tris, and triethylamine
had no effect on V,,,,,, and
these compounds
were therefore used to prepare all buffers from pH 5.0
to 9.5. By a procedure
similar to that previously
described (16) we have
now found that the last three substances are also without effect on K,,
while citrate increases K, and was therefore omitted. Two other anions
tested, ADA* and bis-Tris,
were rejected for the same reason. We
therefore
limited
experiments
in the acid range to pH 5.9, where
Tris-borate
buffer can still be used. Regarding
ionic strength,
there is
evidence from other investigators
(13) that this can affect substrate
binding. Furthermore,
it is known that the molecular aggregation
state
of glucose-6.phosphate
dehydrogenase
is affected by ionic strength (13,
17). It was therefore necessary to ensure that rate determinations
at all
pH values were carried out at the same ionic strength,
which was
chosen to be 0.01 M.
It is not possible to calculate
the amounts
of boric acid and Tris
required to produce a given pH and ionic strength because Tris, acting
as a polyalcohol,
forms, to an unknown
extent, a complex with boric
acid. Consequently
the following
procedure
was adopted.
The ionic
mobilities
of the borate and Tris ions were calculated
from conductivity measurements.
These values were used to calculate
the specific
conductivity
of a solution
of 2 - 0.01 M containing
Tris H- and
ions. Buffers were then prepared
by mixing suitable amounts
WOW,
of stock solutions of boric acid and Tris to give the required pH values
and a conductivity
corresponding
to I = 0.01 M.
Boric acid-triethylamine
buffers were similarly
prepared.
Table I
shows the composition
and approximate
pH of the buffers used. The
precise pH depended
on temperature
and is recorded in the graphical
presentation
of the experimental
data. The small changes of ionic
strength with temperature
were neglected.
Kinetic
Determinations-All
reaction velocity
measurements
were
carried out with a Gilford
recording
spectrophotometer,
model 2000,
equipped
with thermostatic
plates. For the determination
of K, the
composition
of the reaction
mixture
was as follows: Buffer (see “pH
and Ionic Strength”),
0.2 ml; 5 mM NADP+,
0.02 ml; Glc-6-P,
0.01 to
0.02 ml of 4 x lo-‘to
5 x lo-’ M; and water 0.05 to 0.06 ml to a total of
0.3 ml. The reaction was started by the addition

If K, can be interpreted as the dissociation constant for the

the dissociation of this complex, AH’, can be calculated from
the temperature dependence of K,. Plots of log K, at constant

is not apparent from the experimental points available. Activation energies, E, were calculated from Arrhenius plots of values
of log vrnax at constant pH obtained by linear interpolation
between adjacent experimental
points (Fig. 2). The three
enzyme types show very similar dependences of E on pH, there

Temperature-Values
of K,, the Michaelis
constant for
Glc-6-P, were determined by standard double reciprocal plots
of l/v against l/[Glc-6-P] (see Fig. 4 for typical plots). The best
fit line and hence the value and standard error of K, was in
every case calculated using a least squares procedure. The
linearity of these plots demonstrates the absence of cooperativity in the binding of Glc-6-P to the enzyme. The standard error
was ~0.01 to 0.02 in log K,. The degree of reproducibility
of
the enzyme preparations
and the precision of the measurements is indicated in Table II, which lists values of log K, for
two different preparations of variant A.
In contrast to the behavior of log V,,,, the variation of K,
with pH is quite complex (Fig. 5). For each variant there is a
sharp increase of K, with pH between 5.8 and 6.2, and again
from 8.2 upwards. Between pH 6.2 and 8.2 there is a broad
plateau, which in type B (Fig. 56) is interrupted by a “valley”
with a sharp minimum at pH 7.2. In variant A (Fig. 5a) the
valley is remarkably and abruptly interrupted
by a further
change which causes a very sharp maximum instead of a

pH 7.5 and the general trend of the values suggest that the
maximum occurs at 0.2 to 0.3 pH unit higher than for variants

Dependence
of State of Aggregation
on pH-In
order to
estimate the proportions of the tetrameric and dimeric forms of
the enzyme under the conditions used in our kinetic experiments, we carried out gel filtration
experiments at several
different pH values. The difference in elution volume between
tetramer and dimer was clearly demonstrated
at acid. and
alkaline pH (Fig. 8). Between the two extremes, the enzyme
activity peaked at intermediate
elution volumes, as expected
for mixtures of tetramer and dimer in a dissociation equilibrium which is rapid compared to the time required for the
chromatographic
run.

DISCUSSION

A variety of buffers have been
pH Dependence
of V,,,,,-employed over the years in the characterization
of glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants. While many buffers may
be suitable for the purpose of detecting differences between
variants, the choice can no longer be arbitrary when we aim to
pinpoint the role of certain ionizable groups in the mechanism
of action of the enzyme. For this purpose it becomes essential
to eliminate any possible pH-unrelated
buffer effects. Glc-6-P
dehydrogenase is exquisitely sensitive to a large number of
anions and cations (18), as well as to the overall salt concentration. By comparing results on the pH dependence of V,,,,, in
buffers commonly used for characterization
of variants (ll), in
buffers tested for lack of ion-specific effects on V,,,,, (16), and
in the same buffers but with equalized ionic strength (Fig. lo),
it is clear that the pH dependence of V,,,,, becomes progressively simpler, the more the experimental
conditions are
controlled. The hypothesis which can best explain the progressively steep decrease of log V,,,,, as the pH is decreased by 2 pH
units (Fig. 1) is that there is an ionizable group which, in its
conjugate acid form, renders the enzyme.substrate
complex
inactive. This leads to the following equation:

Within the experimental

it is clearly shifted towards a more alkaline pH in the case of

of the group responsible
for the activation
of
the enzyme
is not accompanied
by a configurational
change in
the protein,
these values
for the pK, and for the enthalpy
of
ionization
suggest
that the group
is not the secondary
phosphate
group
of either
substrate,
since AH’
values
for the
secondary
ionization
of sugar phosphates
are close to zero. (The
pK, of the secondary
phosphate
ionization
of Glc-6-P
is 6.565
at 20” and the standard
enthalpy
of ionization
is - 0.88 kcal
mo11’.)3
Both the pK and enthalpy
of ionization
are lower than
the typical
values
of 7.6 to 8.4, and 10 to 13 kcal mol 1
respectively
for a terminal
amino group.
Thus, the most likely
groups
would seem to be sulfhydryl,
for which pK, values and
enthalpies
of ionization
in proteins
have been found
in the
range
6.7 to 8.4 and 6.2 to 8.4 kcal mall’,
respectively,
or
imidazole
(as already
suggested
by Soldin
and Balinsky,
(al),
for which
the ranges
are 6 to 7 and 7 to 8 kcal mol-’
(22).
However,
this inference
must be regarded
as tentative
only,
because,
as studies
on the alkaline
form
of methemoglobin
have shown,
the enthalpies
of ionization
may vary
by many
kcal mall’
from
one methemoglobin
to another
(23), if the
ionizable
group
is situated
in an atypical
environment.
The variation
of the activation
energy
with pH can be readily
accounted
for in terms
of the enthalpy
of ionization
of the
group
responsible
for activation
of the enzyme.
It may be
shown that, since [H+]/(K,

pH Dependence ofK,-The
variation
of K, with pH is much
more complex
than the variation
of V,,,,,. Inspection
of Fig. 5
shows that the behavior
of the three variants
is essentially
the
same, except over the narrow
pH interval
6.9 to 7.6, where K,
for variant
B shows a sharp minimum
at pH 7.2, K, for variant
A shows a sharp maximum
at pH 7.2, and K, for variant
Ashows a sharp maximum
at pH 7.45.
Any interpretation
of the variation
of log K, with pH will
depend
on whether
K, is the dissociation
constant
of the
enzyme.substrate
complex
or whether
it is a ratio of velocity
constants.
There is evidence
that K, for the binding
of NADP+
can be identified
with a dissociation
constant
(24-26).
In the
discussion
that follows
we shall assume
that the same applies
to Glc-6-P
(for an NADP+-saturated
enzyme).
We consider
first those pH regions
where the three variants
show the same behavior.
In the acid region
(pH 5.8 to 6.9),

FIG. 12. Values

of temperature.
The values
of
pK, at each temperature

to Equation

‘.

since there
is no significant
gradual
change
of log K,,
it
appears
that the pK of the secondary
phosphate
ionization
on
the substrate
is not changed
upon
binding
to the enzyme.
Alternatively,
it is possible
that the pK of an ionizable
group
on the enzyme
changes
upon the binding
of Glc-6-P
in a way
that exactly
compensates
the change
in the pK of Glc-6-P,
so
that there
is no net release
or uptake
of hydrogen
ion upon
binding
of the substrate.
In the alkaline
region,
Glc-6-P
carries
on the phosphate
moiety
two negative
charges,
which
are
probably
essential
for binding
to the enzyme.4
It is therefore
likely that a positively
charged
group on the enzyme
is involved
in binding
Glc-6-P,
and the gradual
increase
in K, between
pH
8.2 and 9.4 is indeed
consistent
with the ionization
of a lysine
residue.
Above
pH 9.4 there is a dramatic
increase
in K, and
the values
are not reproducible,

inactivation
of the enzyme.

that the values

pH Dependence of Quaternary Structure-Because
dissociation of the enzyme
tetramer
into dimers
takes place in just the
pH range where the sharp minimum
in log K, occurs (13), it
seemed reasonable
to surmise
that this pH-linked
dissociation
itself could be the major configurational
change giving
rise to a
large
positive
interaction
between
ionizable
groups.
This
supposition
could
be critically
tested
by a comparison
of
several genetic
variants.
If it is correct,
there should be a direct
correlation
between
the pH at which
50% of the enzyme
is
dissociated
and the pH of the extremum
in the plot of log K,
uersus pH. Indeed we found (compare
Figs. 5 and 9) that while
variants
A and B coincide
in pH dependence
of dissociation
and have their pH extremum
at 7.2, variant
A- was shifted
by
the same extent
of about 0.25 pH units in both dissociation
and
log K, behavior.
Further,
as the following
analysis
shows,
there
is good
agreement
between
the degree
of cooperativity
of the ionizations
which
accompany
dissociation
as calculated
from the
chromatographic
data and that estimated
above on the basis of
kinetic
data alone.
If the dissociation
into dimers
is accompanied
by the cooperative
ionization
of n’ ionizable
groups’
a rigorous
description
of the ionization
process
would
involve
the adoption
of some model
for the relationship
between
the
dissociation
and the ionization
of the groups
involved.
However,
a satisfactory
empirical
description
of the degree
of
cooperativity
among
the ionizing
groups
can be obtained
by
describing
the dependence
of the dissocia,tion
equilibrium
by
an equation
analogous
to the Hill
equation
which
has been
used for many
years
to describe
empirically
the binding

of the variants
in the pH range
6.9 to 7.6 require
a more
complex
explanation.
In general,
K, will show a pH dependence
if there
are
ionizable
groups,
the pK values of which
are different
on the
enzyme
and on the enzyme.substrate
complex.
The observed
minimum
or maximum
implies
that more than one ionizable
group
is involved,
and the fact that the plateau
values
of log
K, in acid and alkaline
solution
are approximately
the same
implies
that the net uptake
of protons
integrated
across the pH
range where the extremum
occurs must be zero. However,
the
range of pH over which log K, varies is so narrow
that it cannot
be accounted
for by any number
of independent
ionizable
groups;
cooperativity
between
the ionizable
groups
must
be
postulated.
There are then two essentially
different
situations
in which the observed
variation
of log K, could arise.
1. If there are two sets of cooperatively
ionizing
groups
G,
and G, (the groups
in each set having
the same intrinsic
pK),
and if upon binding
of substrate
the intrinsic
pK values of the
groups
in set G, shift
in the opposite
sense but by an equal
amount
to those in set G,, then log K, will show a sharp
extremum
with pH.
2. If there
is a set of cooperatively
ionizing
groups
on the
enzyme,
and if upon binding
of the substrate
the degree
of
cooperativity
changes,
log K, will show an extremum
with pH,
the sharpness
of which
will still depend
on the number
of
groups and on the degree of cooperativity.
The pH at which the
extremum
occurs
will
depend
on the intrinsic
pK of the
ionizing
groups.
If the cooperativity
decreases
upon binding
of
substrate,
log K, will show a minimum
with pH; if cooperativity increases
upon binding
of substrate,
then log K, will show a
maximum
with pH.
The latter
hypothesis
involves
fewer
assumptions,
and a
physical
basis for it can be visualized
(see below).
We are
therefore
using it here in attempting
to account
quantitatively
for the observed
variation
of log K,.
If we describe
the
cooperative
ionization
of the linked
ionizable
groups
by an
empirical
equation
analogous
to the Hill
equation
used to
describe
the cooperative
binding
of oxygen
to hemoglobin
(27),
we obtain:

aggregation
of an enzyme
is reminiscent
of a number
of
previous
examples
(28, 29). In this case, the phenomenon
is
apparently
related
to the ability
of glucose
6-phosphate
to
affect
the cooperative
binding
(or release)
of a number
of
protons
in the critical
pH region.
By contrast,
no break-point
was observed
in the pH dependence
of V,,,,, for any of the three
variants
studied,
in the pH region in which
the dissociation
of
the tetramer
takes place.
To summarize,
the observed
pH variation
of log K, for
variant
B can be explained
as follows.
1. At an ionic strength
of 0.01 the tetramers
of variant
B of
erythrocyte
glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase
saturated
with
NADP+
but not with Glc-6-P
dissociate
into dimers
in the pH
range 6.9 to 7.4.
2. This
dissociation
is accompanied
by the cooperative
ionization
of at least six to eight groups
such that 50% of the
groups
are ionized
at pH 7.2 and the Hill constant
is approximately
6.
3. The enzyme
completely
saturated
with both NADP+
and
Glc-6-P
also dissociates,
so that 50% of the dissociation-linked
ionizable
groups
are ionized
at pH 7.2, but the Hill constant
is
less than that for the enzyme
without
Glc-6-P
bound.
4. This model
implies
that
variant
A should
also behave
similarly,
so that
50% of the dissociation-linked
groups
are
ionized
at pH 7.2. However,
the minimum
in the log K, versus
pH curve
implies
that the Hill constant
for the dissociationlinked
ionizable
groups
increases
when Glc-6-P
is bound to the
enzyme.
For variant
A- the pH of 50% dissociation
is 7.45 but, as with
variant
B, the Hill constant
for the dissociation-linked
ionizable groups decreases
when Glc-6-P
is bound
to the enzyme.
Differences among Variants-The
data
presented
in this
paper
indicate
that a single
amino
acid replacement
entails
detectable
differences
in the thermodynamics
of substrate
binding.
There is no reason to believe
that the replaced
amino
acid is physically
a part of the binding
site; if it were, we would
expect
differences
in K,
and AH over
a wide
pH range.
Instead,
we presume
that a replacement
even in a distant
part
of the molecule
can affect substrate
binding
indirectly,
under
appropriate
conditions,
because
of the cooperative
nature
of
the entire
protein
molecule.
In the case of methemoglobins,
it
has been demonstrated
that
amino
acid replacements
quite
remote
from the heme group can alter the binding
of azide and
other ligands
(30). Thus, it is now apparent
thqt the differences
between
the B and A variants
of glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase
are not limited
to electrophoretic
mobility,
but they
include
a number
of enzymic
properties
(Table
III). All three
variants,
A, B, and A-,
are regularly
described
as being
indistinguishable
with respect to their affinity
for Glc-6-P
(33):
not surprisingly,
since measurements
are routinely
carried
out
at pH 7.8 to 8.0, where enzyme
activity
is somewhat
higher.
On
the other hand,
differences
in K, for glucose 6.phosphate
can
be detected
at pH 7.2, a fact which
may be of considerable
physiological
relevance,
since this is the intracellular
pH of the
erythrocyte
(34). As far as the tetramer-dimer
equilibrium
is
concerned,
it is impossible
to know
whether,
within
the
erythrocyte,
the transition
occurs at exactly
the pH observed
in
Fig. 9. However,
it appears
likely that, whatever
the displacement in the curve due to the numerous
differences
between
in
uiuo and in vitro conditions,
it will be comparable
for the three
variants
we have investigated.
Thus, other things being equal,
A- is likely to have a greater
proportion
of tetramers
than A or
B: an example
of how mutation,

volumes
for
the tetramer,
the dimer,
and the mixture
of tetramers
and
dimers
at any particular
pH. From
inspection
of Fig. 9, we
obtain
values of 36.0 and 47.0 for V, and V,, respectively.
A plot
of log a2/(L
(u) against
pH (Fig.
14) yields
a slope of 4.1.
According
to Equation
5, this is the Hill
constant
for the
cooperativity
of proton
release
in the course of the tetramerdimer
transition.
The uncertainties
in the values of V, and V,
are approximately
0.05. An estimate
of the precision
in the
value of p’ may be made by choosing
values of 36.5 and 46.5 for
V, and V,, respectively.
These values
give p’ = 5.3. The few
points available
for variant
A- (Fig. 14) suggest that p’ for this
variant
is the same as for variants
A and B. These values of p’
are to be compared
with the values
of 6.5 and 5.9 obtained
above independently
for p from the data on the dependence
of
log K, on pH.
Given the limited
precision
of the chromatographic
data and
given the assumptions
implicit
in each method
of determining
n’, or p, it is not to be expected
that the agreement
between
the
values
obtained
from
the two types
of experiments
could
be
better
than this. Indeed,
the agreement
is sufficient
to confirm
that the dissociation
of the enzyme
into dimers is accompanied
by the ionization
of a number
of groups showing
a high degree
of cooperativity.

We now know that variant
A- differs kinetically
from variant
B
in at least two ways:
(a) the pH extremum
in K, is changed
from
a minimum
to a maximum
and (b) the pH of the
extremum
is changed.
It is conceivable
that, by subtle effects,
one type of amino acid substitution
(B - A) affects
only q for
the enzyme
substrate
complex,
while
another
type of amino
acid substitution
(B - A-)
affects
both
q and the pH of
dissociation.
However,
a far simpler
explanation
is that variant
B differs from variant
A by a change
in an amino
acid residue
which affects the relative
vaiue of p for the enzyme
and q for the
enzyme.substrate
complex,
but which
does not affect the pH
at which the enzyme
dissociates
into dimers;
while variant
Adiffers
from variant
A by a change

which
affects
the pH at which
the enzyme
dissociates

but which does not affect the relative

This would

with the notion
of two successive
mutations
having
taken
place
in the evolution
of the gene for A- from
the

wild-type
gene for B. The
validity
of this notion
will
be
eventually
settled
when
data on primary
structure
become
available.
Meanwhile,
it could also be tested experimentally
by
carrying
out similar
studies
on other available
genetic variants,
especially
those which are polymorphic
in various
populations
and which
are associated
with enzyme
deficiency
(33).

Achnowledgments-We
would
like to thank
Mr.
A. Afuwape,

structure
of a protein,
can also affect the quaternary
structure.
It is possible
that
this unique
property
of A-, one of the
commonest
“deficient”
types of glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase, also relates
to its faster rate of inactivation,
for which
we have proposed
a specific
model
(35).
At the present
time, because
the primary
structure
of A- is
not known,
it is relevant
to ask what suggestions
can be derived
from
the findings
in this paper
regarding
the relationships
among
the three variants
studied.
As mentioned
earlier,
it is
usually
assumed
that
variant
B is the normal
wild-type
enzyme,
and that variants
A and A- arose from
it by single
amino
acid substitutions
based on point mutations,
