Summary
This report describes twin girls with typical features of ataxia-telangiectasia, including increased alphafetoprotein, radio-resistant DNA synthesis, characteristic chromosome abnormality, and immunodeficiency.
They have, in addition, microcephaly and mental retardation. Complementation studies were performed
utilizing Sendai virus-mediated fusion of fibroblast cell lines. Complementation was observed with patients
in ataxia-telangiectasia complementation groups A, C, and E but not with the cell line from a patient with
the Nijmegen breakage syndrome, in which patients have microcephaly, radio-resistant DNA synthesis,
chromosome aberrations, and immunodeficiency but lack ataxia and telangiectasia. These data suggest
that the Nijmegen breakage syndrome and the patients described here are not genetically distinct entities
but form a spectrum of one disorder.

Introduction

Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is a rare, autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by minimal criteria of
ataxia plus radio-resistant DNA synthesis (RDS). Most
patients manifest telangiectasia, increased alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), characteristic chromosomal rearrangements, and immunodeficiency, and about one-third
develop lymphoreticular malignancy. Another chromosomal instability syndrome, the Nijmegen breakage
syndrome (NBS) overlaps in several ways with AT (Weemaes et al. 1982; Taalman et al. 1983). Patients with
NBS manifest RDS, immunodeficiency, and chromosomal aberrations similar to those seen in AT, and some
have had increased cancer risk. However, these patients
lack the classical features of AT, namely ataxia, telangiectasia, and an elevated AFP and, in addition, have
microcephaly and mental retardation. We have recently

studied identical twins with ataxia, telangiectasia,
microcephaly, mental retardation, RDS, and chromosomal aberrations who appear to be an important
link in understanding the relationship between AT and
NBS. We refer to this AT variant as "ATFresno."
The RDS abnormality allowed us to perform complementation studies with other AT patients. In each
case, complementation was observed, indicating that
ATFrsno is a genetic defect different from that in AT patients in complementation groups A and C (Jaspers et
al. 1988). However, ATFresno did not complement the
RDS of a patient with NBS, suggesting that, although
patients with NBS do not have ataxia or telangiectasia,
they form part of a genetic spectrum that includes AT.
Case Report

SV and LV, originally seen at the age of 9 years, were
the product of an uncomplicated twin pregnancy to a
25-year-old mother and a 42-year-old father with two
previously normal children. There was no parental consanguinity. Delivery took place in Mexico; their birth
weights are unknown. Their early growth was satisfactory, but developmental milestones were delayed, with

Ataxia-Telangiectasia Variant
sitting occurring at 1 year and walking occurring at
18 mo. Language development was delayed, and verbal
abilities have declined with time. Microcephaly was
documented in both girls at an early age, in Mexico.
By age 6 years they were noted by physicians to have
a movement disorder and truncal ataxia; this has been
progressive. At age 13 years they are ambulatory only
with the use of walkers. Their exact IQ is not known,
but they are felt to function in the moderate-to-severe
range of mental retardation. Neither has had severe
sinopulmonary infection, although chronic rhinorrhea
was a complaint in both girls which was resolved after
they were placed on a regimen of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.
Physical examination at age 13 years revealed identical twins with apathetic, sad facies. Their heights were
132 and 134 cm, weights 20 and 25 kg, and head circumferences 49.5 and 49 cm (all growth parameters
below the third percentile). Craniofacial examination
was normal, with the exception of scleral telangiectasia. Small tonsils were noted. Both girls had Tanner stage
II breast development but scant pubic hair and no axillary hair. Extremities revealed mild limitation of flexion and extension at all major joints. Neurologic examination revealed athetoid movements of the arms,
apraxic eye movements, and marked truncal ataxia.
Deep tendon reflexes were depressed in both. Ophthalmological examination revealed normal retinas.
Cytogenetics
Patients' and parents' peripheral blood specimens were
cultured in Difco chromosome medium, and mitotic
cells were arrested with colcemid (0.05 gg/ml final concentration) and fixed routinely. The slides were aged
overnight in a 650C oven and then were banded with
trypsin and were stained with 2% Giemsa solution.
The patients' skin biopsy specimens were minced
asceptically and initiated in minimal essential medium
(MEM) supplemented with 20% FBS, 50 gg gentamycin sulfate/ml, and 2% L-glutamine. The cultures were
incubated in a 370C incubator with 5% C02 until appropriate mitotic fibroblast growth was achieved.
For identifying chromosome aberrations such as
breaks, deletions, ring formation, and translocations,
50 mitotic cells were examined from the peripheral
blood slides and 25 cells were scored from the skin fibroblast cells. The frequency of chromosome aberrations
was compared with the frequency obtained from the
subjects studied in the laboratory during the previous
6 mo.

271
Inhibition of DNA Synthesis
In both patients the effect that ionizing radiation had
on the rate of DNA replication was measured according to the method of Jaspers et al. (1982). Cultured
fibroblasts were prelabeled with 14C-thymidine overnight and were exposed to graded doses of X-rays at
room temperature. Then they were labeled for 4 h with
3H-thymidine and were harvested. The rate of DNA
synthesis was estimated by the ratio of trichloroacetic
acid-precipitable 3H to 14C radioactivities measured in
a liquid scintillation counter. Results were expressed
as a percentage of the values obtained in unirradiated
control cells.

Complementation Studies
Cell strains and culture conditions. -Human fibroblasts
were cultured in Ham's F10 medium supplemented with
antibiotics, 10% FBS, and 2% SerumPlus' (Gibco, Ltd).
AT25LA and AT26LA were obtained from patients SV
and LV, respectively. ATSLA (group A) and AT1BR
(group C) are from classical AT patients (Jaspers et al.
1985, and in press). 1129W is from patient 7 reported
by Seemanova et al. (1985) and belongs to the same
complementation group (Vi) as the originally described patient with NBS (Weemaes et al. 1981; Jaspers
et al. 1988). GM7166 (group V2) was obtained from
the Human Genetic Mutant Repository in Camden, NJ.
Complernentation analysis. - Genetic complementation
studies were performed as described by Jaspers using
his previously decribed methodology (Jaspers and
Bootsma 1932). Two cell strains to be fused were each
preloaded with plastic microspheres of a distinct size.
One day after Sendai virus-mediated cell fusion they
were exposed to 40 Gy of 300 kV X-rays and were cultured in the presence of tritiated thymidine for 2 h. After fixation and processing for autoradiography, grains
were counted over 50 S-phase nuclei in homodikaryons
and heterodikaryons, discriminated on the basis oftheir
content of large or small cytoplasmic plastic beads. The
presence of complementation was inferred if the mean
grain number over the heterodikaryons was significantly
lower than the value expected for noncomplementation, i.e., the average of the values in the two types of

homodikaryons.

IgA, IgM, were normal in both girls at 9, 11, and 13
years of age. AFP was elevated in both: 121 ng/ml in
SV and 156 ng/ml in LV (normal <10 ng/ml). In peripheral blood the mononuclear cells' proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin was below normal (644
and 700/mm3 [normal 868-2,214/mm3; established
at Valley Children's Hospital Immunology Laboratory]).
The absolute numbers of total T cells, T cell helpers
(448 and 430/cu mm3 [normal 560-1,566/mm3)], and
T cells suppressors (251 and 260/cu mm3 [normal
280-864/mm3)] were decreased, but the helper:suppressor ratios were in the normal range at ages 11 and
13 years. Specific antibody response following pneumococcal polysaccharide immunization was absent in
both girls.
Cytogenetic Studies

1. Peripheral blood.- In lymphocyte cultures stimulated
with phytohemagglutinin, banded metaphases demonstrated breaks or rearrangements in 26% of cells in SV
and in 44% in LV (lab average 3.8%). In SV, 77% of
the aberrations involved chromosome 7 and 23% involved chromosome 14. In LV, 63% of breaks involved
chromosome 7 and 23% involved 14. Breakpoints
clustered most frequently in chromosome 7, at 7pl3,
7plS, 7pll, 7q35, and 7q36, and in chromosome 14,
at 14q11, 14q12, 14q13, and 14q32 (fig. 1). One twin
demonstrated a deletion of a chromosome 2 at p12.
2. Fibroblasts.-Fibroblast chromosomes revealed chromosome breakage in the forms of deletions, gaps, chromatid breaks, and chromosome breaks. The frequency
was 52% in SV and 32% in LV (lab average 7.97%).
As has been noted in other AT patients, no preferential
involvement of chromosomes 7, 14, 2, or 22 was observed (Kojis et al., in press).

3. Parental chromosome studies. -Only a normal number of breaks and rearrangements were noted in the peripheral blood karyotypes of either parent. The father's
karyotype was 46,XY,13p+,16qh+. The mother's
karyotype revealed 3% sex chromosome mosaicism
(46 ,XX/45 ,XO/47,XXX/48 ,XXXX).
Inhibition of DNA Synthesis by Ionizing Radiation

Cultured skin fibroblasts were tested for their response
to X-ray exposure. In cells from both twins, the inhibition of DNA replication was less pronounced than it
was in cells from a normal control (fig. 2) and was very
similar to that in cells from two different classical AT
patients.
Complementation Analysis
Owing to the presence of RDS, characteristic of AT
and NBS, there was the possibility to perform complementation studies in fused fibroblasts, by utilizing
the method of Jaspers and Bootsma (1982). The data
in table 1 show that a normal (radio-sensitive) type of
DNA synthesis was partially restored in heterokaryons
after fusion of AT25LA fibroblasts with representatives
from AT complementation groups A and C and with
cells from NBS group V2 (GM7166). In two independent tests, no complementation was observed with
1129W, a representative of NBS group V1.
Discussion
We have described twin patients with shared features
of both classical AT (i.e., ataxia, telangiectasia, char-

acteristic chromosomal rearrangements, increased AFP,
and RDS) and NBS (i.e., microcephaly and mental
retardation). Complementation studies assign these pa-

seen in both AT and NBS formed a single
because none of the patients with NBS had
ataxia or telangiectasia. The twin patients described
in this report have the hallmarks of both syndromes.
The cells of SV do not correct (i.e., complement) the
radiation hypersensitivity of a patient with NBS, suggesting that the genetic defects of both patients are either related through a common pathway or involve the
same gene. The lack of complementation suggests that
deletion of contiguous genes is not probable. Because
of clear-cut clinical distinctions between the two conditions, two different mutations within the same gene
seems most likely, although other explanations are possible.
The chromosomal instability syndromes can be
divided into the following two mutually exclusive
groups: (1) those with increased sister-chromatid exchange (i.e., Fanconi syndrome and Bloom syndrome)
and (2) those with increased RDS and chromosomal
aberrations of 7 and 14, i.e., all AT and NBS complementation groups, including those affected in the
V1 gene (Weemaes 1983; Seemanova et al. 1985) (this
group includes ATFesno) and in the V2 gene (Sperling
1983; Wegner et al. 1988 [same patients]; Conley 1986).
The group with increased RDS can be further divided
into the following three syndromes on the basis of complementation studies and clinical symptomatology: (1)
Complementation groups A, C, D, and E classical AT
with increased AFP and ataxia; (2) V1 patients with
microcephaly, immunodeficiency, and, in the Fresno patients, ataxia and telangiectasia; (3) V2 patients with
growth failure, microcephaly, and immunodeficiency
but without ataxia or telangiectasia.
The AT-NBS complementation group VI currently

Czechoslovakian (Seemanova et al. 1985, patients 2 and
7), and now Mexican origins. The Dutch patient was
a 10-year-old boy with microcephaly, poor growth, mental retardation, caf&-au-lait spots, and immunodeficiency. An older brother had the same symptoms with
a more severe immunodeficiency. Karyotyping revealed
multiple rearrangements of chromosomes 7 and 14. The
parents were consanguineous. The two Czech patients
were described in a report, by Seemanova et al. (1985),
of nine patients with a possibly heterogeneous syndrome. They all shared microcephaly, unusual facies,
normal intelligence, immunodeficiency, and increased
cancer risk. Chromosome analysis in patients 2 and
7 were eventually successful after several attempts and
demonstrated multiple chromosomal rearrangements.
Specific involvement of chromosomes 7 and 14 was not
reported. Neither patient 2 nor patient 7 has had malignancies, although four patients in the report had developed lymphoreticular cancer and a sibling of patient
2 had developed lymphosarcoma at age 2.
A summary of the clinical features of the patients
currently assigned to the Vi and V21 complementation
groups is seen in table 2. It remains unclear whether
the patients affected in the V2 gene can have ataxia or
whether the fibroblasts of any patients with this syndrome might not complement (i.e., involve a defect of
the same gene in) the RDS of any classical AT patients
in complementation groups A, C, D, or E. The
identification of such a patient would further extend
the genetic heterogeneity of AT to include the V2 patients on a basis other than RDS and chromosomal aber-

rations of 7 and 14. Complementation analysis of other
reported atypical patients would be of great interest
(Byrne et al. 1984; Fiorilli et al. 1985; Maraschio et
al. 1986; Taylor et al. 1987; Teebi et al. 1987).
Recognizing genetic heterogeneity or subsets of disease is important for prognosticating and for genetic
counseling, expecially now that the gene for the most
common complementation group (AT[A]) has been
localized to chromosome 11q22-23 (Gatti et al. 1988).
The ATFresno patients add to our understanding of heterogeneity of the AT-chromosome breakage syndromes.
It appears that AT and NBS patients may form a spectrum of one disease and are not genetically distinct entities. Further study of other atypical patients may clarify
the underlying genetic etiology.
