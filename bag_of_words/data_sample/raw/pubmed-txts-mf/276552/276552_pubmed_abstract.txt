In a study of 67 cases the authors have investigated clinically and radiologically the long term results (5 years and over) of the sagittal split technique (Obwegeser 1955, 1957). Although 95% of the patients are satisfied, 60% have some impairment of sensation in the lower lip. This however goes unnoticed in 40% of these cases. The temporo-mandibular joint does not appear to be affected. 73% of the patients have excellent or good occlusion, while 18% have an unsatisfactory anterior occlusion due to some degree of relapse. The remaining 9% have poor occlusion without sign of relapse. A statistical analysis of the teleradiographs reveals that relapse is due to a rotation of the body of the mandible. Since several changes in technique have meanwhile been adopted, this paper will be followed by an analysis of the more recent cases.
