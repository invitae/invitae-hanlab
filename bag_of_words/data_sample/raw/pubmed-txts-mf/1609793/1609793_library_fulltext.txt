Summary
We have discovered two different point mutations in a single codon of the X-linked androgen-receptor (AR)
gene in two pairs of unrelated families who have complete androgen insensitivity (resistance) associated
with different AR phenotypes in their genital skin fibroblasts. One mutation is a C-to-T transition at a CpG
sequence near the 5' terminus of exon 6; it changes the sense of codon 773 from arginine to cysteine, ablates
specific androgen-binding activity at 370C, and eliminates a unique KpnI site at the intron-exon boundary.
The other mutation is a G-to-A transition that changes amino acid 773 to histidine and eliminates an SphI
site. This mutant AR has a normal androgen-binding capacity at 370C but has a reduced affinity for androgens
and is thermolabile in their presence. Transient transfection of COS cells with cDNA expression vectors
yielded little androgen-binding activity at 370C from Arg773Cys and abundant activity with abnormal properties from Arg773His, thereby proving thepathogenicity of both sequence alterations. This conclusion
coincides with the following facts about evolutionary preservation of the position homologous to Arg773 in
the AR: it is occupied by Arg or lysine in the progesterone, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid receptors,
and it is within a 14-amino-acid region of their steroid-binding domains that share "-85% amino acid identity.
Introduction
Testosterone and Sct-dihydrotestosterone share primary responsibility for male sexual morphogenesis
and for virilization at puberty (Wilson 1978). Their
actions are mediated by the androgen receptor (AR),
the product of a Xq12-linked gene (Brown et al.
1989). The AR belongs to the superfamily of ligandactivated, transcription-regulating proteins whose
DNA-binding domains, encoded by exons 2 and 3 (or

B and C), share the "double-zinc-finger" motif (O'Malley 1990). Its carboxy-terminal androgen-binding domain, encoded by exons 4-8 (or D-H), shares ".'50%
overall amino acid sequence homology with the
steroid-binding domains of the receptors for progesterone, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid (Chang
et al. 1988; Lubahn et al. 1988; Kuiper et al. 1989;
Tilley et al. 1989; Govindan 1990). These four steroid
receptors form a subfamily within the superfamily.
The stereochemistry that permits the AR to bind
androgen selectively, and how an androgenic ligand
contributes to the transcriptional regulatory attributes
of an A-R complex are unknown. To help provide
such information, we (Ris-Stalpers et al. 1990, 1991;
Sai et al. 1990; Trifiro et al. 1991a, 1991b) and others
(Brown et al. 1988, 1990; Marcelli et al. 1990a,
1990b, 1991a, 1991 b; McPhaul et al. 1991) have be143

gun to use molecular-genetic techniques to study the
AR of individuals and families who have different
degrees of androgen insensitivity. Their clinical phenotypes vary from women with the syndrome of complete testicular feminization to men with mild undervirilization. In this paper we report two pairs of
Canadian families with complete androgen insensitivity that share two different missense mutations at codon 773 in the androgen-binding domain of the AR.

Cell Culture and Assay of Specific Androgen-binding Activity

Subjects, Material, and Methods

Labium majus skin fibroblast strains were developed after obtaining informed consent, according to
an approved protocol. They and the COS-1 monkey
kidney cells used as transfectants were maintained in
Eagle's minimal essential medium (Earle's salts) supplemented with 5%-10% FCS, 1 mM pyruvate, 10
mg garamycin/liter, 60 mg of penicillin G/liter, and
60 mg of streptomycin/liter. The specific androgenbinding activity of monolayers in Petri dishes was
quantitated and characterized according to the
method described in detail by Gottlieb et al. (1987).

The Propositae and Their Families

DNA Isolation and Southern Analysis

The mother of family 1 is French-Canadian. As reported by Pinsky et al. (1977), two of her 46,XY children have the typical clinicopathologic features of
complete androgen insensitivity. Labium majus skin
fibroblasts of the younger (coded here as LEL) have
specific androgen-binding activity that is <5 fmol/mg
protein, at 370C (i.e., were receptor negative). We
were not permitted to study her sister, whose menarche was at age 18 years, or her three daughters, each
of whom has apparently unaffected children.
The mother of family 2 is English-Canadian. As
recorded by Kaufman et al. (1976), her daughter
(coded as TML) and two sisters have complete testicular feminization. TML's labium majus skin fibroblasts
have specific androgen-binding activity that is <5
fmol/ mg protein.
The mother of family 3 is French-Canadian. As reported by Gottlieb et al. (1987), her daughter (coded
as 30285) has the typical clinical, endocrine, and
pathologic signs of complete androgen insensitivity.
The AR in her genital skin fibroblasts has a normal
binding capacity, but it has a decreased affinity for
androgens and is unstable in their presence.
The mother of family 4 is English-Canadian. She
was born when her father was about 45 years old. Her
only affected daughter (coded as 6779) presented at
age 18 years with primary amenorrhea and sparse to
absent sexual hair, despite otherwise normal pubertal
feminization. Her peripheral lymphocyte karyotype
was 46,XY. Intraabdominal exploration exposed two
pelvic testes, histologically; the left had a nodule of
Leydig cell hyperplasia, and the right was attached to
a rudimentary fallopian tube. The androgen-binding
activity in 6779's genital skin fibroblasts is described
here for the first time (see Results).

DNA was isolated from genital skin fibroblasts (Sai
et al. 1990) or peripheral lymphocytes (Greenberg et
al. 1987), precisely as described. Blots were obtained
with either diazobenzyloxymethyl (DBM) paper (Alwine et al. 1979) or Hybond-N membrane. cDNA
probes spanning the coding region were labeled to a
specific activity >5 x 108 cpm / gg, by random priming (Feinberg and Vogelstein 1983).
RNA Isolation and Northern Analysis

RNA was isolated from genital skin fibroblasts by
the guanidinium isothiocyanate method, precisely according to the method described by Sai et al. (1990).
Poly(A + ) RNA was isolated using the Fast Track Kit
(Invitrogen), was fractionated on 1% agarose gels
containing 2.2 M formaldehyde (Murphy and Dotzlaw 1989), was blotted onto DBM paper (Alwine et
al. 1979), and was probed with a 0.7-kb AR cDNA,
overlapping its DNA- and androgen-binding domains
(Trifiro et al. 1991a).
Reverse Transcription (RT), PCR Amplification, and
Sequencing of Androgen-binding Domain in the AR cDNA
RT and PCR amplication of the portion of normal
and LEL cDNA encoding the androgen-binding domain was carried out exactly according to the method
described by Sai et al. (1990). Each product was
blunt-ended by using T4 DNA polymerase, was digested with EcoRI, was separated on a 1.2% agarose
gel, and was electroeluted. The fragments obtained
were ligated with HinclI/EcoRI-digested Bluescript
(SK) vectors (Stratagene) by using 2 units of T4 DNA
ligase at 14°C for 18 h. The resulting plasmids
(pSK.hAR and pSK.hARLEL) were transformed into

XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene). After large-scale plasmid

145

Androgen Resistance: hAR Arg773Cys or His
preparations, double-stranded DNA was sequenced
by using both T7 and T3 primers, as described in the
Sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemical).
PCR Amplification of Genomic Exons

For exons 2-8, we used conditions and sets of
flanking intronic primers defined by Trifiro et al.
(1991a). Exon 1 of LEL was amplified in sections
according to the method described by Lubahn et al.
(1989), with two modifications: (a) we used primer
1. lB0 (5'GCTCTGGGACGCAACCTCTCTC) in
place of their primer A2; and (b), for the GC-rich
region encoding the glycine tract, we used VENT
polymerase (New England Biolabs) as recommended,
except for 5 mM Mg2+ and 50:150 gM dGTP:7deaza-dGTP (Innis 1990).
Direct DNA Sequencing

This was done exactly according to the method described by Trifiro et al. (1991b) for exons 2-8, and,
for parts of exon 1, it was done by using primers (AlA8) described by Lubahn et al. (1989). In addition,
we used our primers 1. lA (5'GTGGAAGATTCAGCCAAGCT) and 1.lb (5'TTGCTGTTCCTCATCCAGGA) for a region between primers A7 and A8.
7-deaza-dGTP replaced dGTP for sequencing exon 1
regions encoding the glutamine or glycine tracts.
Construction of AR cDNA Expression Vector with Arg773Cys

Both a 147-bp EcoRI-HincII fragment containing
codon 773 from pSK.hARLEL and a 760-bp KpnIHinclI fragment from pGEM-3Z.hARo were ligated
into a KpnI/partial EcoRI-digested fragment of pGEM3Z.hARo, to form pGEM-3Z.hARLEL. pSV.ARo is
a pBR328-based, full-length hAR cDNA expression
vector containing the SV40 early promoter and the
rabbit 3-globin poly-A signal (Brinkmann et al. 1989).
A 1,011-bp KpnI-PvuI fragment of it was replaced by
a homologous insert from KpnI-PvuI-treated pGEM3Z.hARLEL containing codon 773. The exclusive
presence of the C- T substitution was ascertained.
Construction of AR cDNA Expression Vector with Arg773His

Two opposite-sense 20-nucleotide oligonucleotides
synthesized to contain the appropriate singlenucleotide substitution (sense: 5'AATGAGTACCACATGCACAA 3' and antisense: 5'TTGTGCATGTGGTACTCATT 3'). With normal hAR cDNA
used as a template, separate PCRs were conducted: (a)
the sense oligonucleotide with the downstream antiwere

sense primer and (b) the antisense oligonucleotide with
an upstream sense primer. The two products, containing
upstream or downstream sequences, overlapped at the
mutation site. They and the same up- and downstream
primers, were used in a second PCR. The single product was cleaved with ScaI and BstBI to yield a mutated
276-bp fragment that was ligated into the ScaI-BstBItreated expression vector, pBSV.hARo, a form of
pSV.hARo modified to contain a unique BstBI site.
Recombinant clones were tested for resistance to SphI
digestion and were sequenced for exclusivity.
Construction of the MMTV.GH Reporter Plasmid

pMMTV.CAT (Miesfeld et al. 1986), obtained
from J. Drouin (Montreal), was digested with NheI
and HindIII to yield a 1,447-bp fragment containing
its long-terminal repeat (LTR). p4GH, a pUC12 vector (Nichols Institute, Los Angeles) containing the human growth hormone (hGH) gene, was digested with
XbaI and HindIII. The LTR fragment was ligated cohesively into p4GH because NheI and XbaI ends are
sticky. The resulting reporter construct puts the hGH
gene under the regulatory influence of four glucocorticoid/progesterone/androgen response elements
from the LTR of the MMTV.
Transfection of COS- I Cells by Electroporation

COS-1 cells were washed and resuspended in icecold PBS to a concentration of 20 million/ml. A 0.5ml portion of the cell suspension was transferred to a
sterile, cold cuvette (electrode gap 0.4 cm; Bio-Rad),
10-20 gg of plasmid DNA were added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 5 min. The shock parameters were 250 V, 960 RF, and 35 ms. After a 10-min,
postshock incubation on ice, the cells in each cuvette
were resuspended in 1.5 ml of medium (if more than
one cuvette was used, the suspensions were fused),
and 0.5 million cells were placed in each 35-mm petri
dish.
At specified times after transfection, various concentrations of androgen were added to the medium,
the specific androgen-binding activity in the cells was
characterized, and, when applicable, the concentration of growth hormone in the medium was measured
radioimmunometrically as recommended by the assay
kit (Nichols Institute, Los Angeles).
Western Analysis of the AR in Transfected COS- I Cells
Confluent monolayers ("'5 million cells) in 60-mm
petri dishes were washed twice with PBS and were

lysed with 80 il of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 100 mM DTT, and
100 gg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/ ml. Thereafter, preparation of the cell extracts, SDS-PAGE, western transfer, by electroblotting, and blocking were
performed according to the methods described by
Sambrook et al. (1989). The nitrocellulose filters were
incubated overnight at 4°C, with a monoclonal antibody (F39.41) to a peptide (SP61) corresponding to
amino acids 301-320 in the N-terminal portion of the
hAR (Zegers et al. 1991). The antibody was diluted
1/400 in 10 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mM
NaCl (Tris-buffered saline, [TBS]). After three washes
in TBS, the filters were incubated with a 1 / 1,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G for 1 h at room temperature. After
three more washes each in TBS with and without 0.5 %
Tween-20, the blots were developed with 4-chloro-1naphthanol in the presence of H202 for 15 min.

Results
Androgen-binding Activity

The genital skin fibroblasts of LEL (family 1) and
TML (family 2) had negligible specific androgenbinding activity (i.e., receptor negative) at 37°C, as
previously reported by Kaufman et al. (1976) and Pin-

sky et al. (1977). In contrast, those of 30285 (family
3) and 6779 (family 4) had activities in the normal
range (12-50 fmol/mg protein). The AR in 30285's
fibroblasts had previously been reported (a) to have a
subnormal affinity for androgen, by both Scatchard
analysis and off-rate analysis, (b) to form thermolabile
A-R complexes, and (c) to resist up-regulation during
prolonged incubation with the nonmetabolizable androgens, mibolerone, and methyltrienolone (Gottlieb
et al. 1987). The cells of 6779 also failed to up-regulate, and they formed A-R complexes that dissociated
at abnormally fast rates, identical to those of 30285

(fig. 1).
Identification of the Mutations

Major AR gene disruption was ruled out, both by
Southern analysis after digestion with BamHI, EcoRI,
and HindIII and the use of various cDNA probes
(Trifiro et al. 1991a) and by northern analysis that
revealed normal amounts of an "-'10-kb AR mRNA in
the fibroblasts of LEL and 6779 (fig. 2).
The Arg773Cys mutation. - Reflecting a C-to-T transition (fig. 3), this mutation was identified first in LEL by
indirect sequencing of the androgen-binding domain
(exons 4-8) after PCR amplification of her cDNA. It
was confirmed by directly sequencing both strands of
PCR-amplified genomic exon 6 (fig. 4). Its apparent
uniqueness was demonstrated by sequencing exons
1-4 in like manner.

Kpnl analysis of the Arg773Cys mutation. -The nucleotide alteration predicted ablation of a unique KpnI
restriction site at the intron 5-exon 6 boundary (fig.
4). Southern analysis of KpnI-digested genomic DNA
uncovered only TML among 11 unrelated subjects
with complete androgen insensitivity. She and LEL
have a band of "415 kb in place of ones at "410 and
5-kb (fig. 5). KpnI digestion of PCR-amplified exon 6
showed that the affected sister of LEL had only KpnIresistant exon 6 in her peripheral lymphocyte DNA
(fig. 6, left panel). It is surprising that two different
samples of their mother's DNA yielded only KpnIsensitive exon 6. Hence, she is a somatic-germ cell
mosaic. We were not permitted to pursue this. TML's
mother, also an obligate heterozygote, does have the
two fragments representing KpnI sensitivity of the normal exon 6 allele (fig. 6, right panel).
The Arg773His mutation. -Representing a G-to-A
transition (figs. 4 and 7, top), this mutation was discovered in both 30285 (family 3) and 6779 (family

uniqueness was defined by sequencing the other exons
and not finding any abnormality in them.
Sphl analysis of the Arg773His mutation. -The nucleotide alteration predicted ablation of an SphI site (fig.
4). As expected (fig. 7, bottom), 30285 only had the
parental product of PCR-amplified exon 6, and we
discovered that her mother was probably heterozygous: her DNA had the mutant SphI-resistant allele

Expression of Mutant AR cDNAs and Transactivational
Activity of Mutant ARs

When pSVhAR.LEL (Arg773Cys) is transfected
into COS-1 cells, they acquire a normal amount of AR
protein (fig. 8), but their A-R complexes dissociate 15
times faster than normal, even at 220C, and they have
a low specific androgen-binding activity that is profoundly thermolabile (table 1). Furthermore, when incubated with 3 nM mibolerone (MB) after cotransfection with pMMTV.GH, insignificant amounts of GH
are produced (table 2).
When pSVhAR.30285 (Arg773His) is transfected
into COS-1 cells, they acquire abundant androgenbinding activity because of an AR with a lower than
normal affinity for androgen (figs. 9 and 10). When
cotransfected with pMMTV.GH and incubated for
72 h with <6.4 nM MB, they reached maximal GH
production at 3.2 nM; replicates transfected with the
normal AR cDNA needed <1 nM (fig. 11, left). We
also measured the androgen-binding activity of
transfected COS-1 cells after (a) continuous incubation with various concentrations of MB for 72 h ("regulated") or (b) incubation for only 2 h, at 70-72 h

'v2,000 fmol of "basal" binding activity/mg protein,
at 6.4 nM MB, whether transfected with the normal
or mutant AR cDNA (fig. 11, right); however, during
prolonged incubation with MB, the normal binding
activity went up, while the mutant's went down.
Discussion
A fully sequenced hAR cDNA, knowledge of flanking intronic sequence, and PCR have enabled us to
identify, in two pairs of unrelated families with complete androgen insensitivity, either a single C- T transition or a single G- A transition in codon 773 (CGC)
of exon 6 (or exon G), a transition that changes its
sense from Arg to Cys (TGC) or His (CAC), respectively. Strong circumstantial evidence pointed to the
pathogenicity of these substitutions. First, we did not
find either substitution in the AR of 10 normal X chromosomes or in conjunction with another proved or
putative pathogenic sequence alteration in any of 39
other families with complete or partial androgen in-

sensitivity. Second, the positions homologous to AR
Arg773 are occupied by Arg or Lys in the three other
receptors of the AR subfamily, and it is in a region of
the androgen-binding domain of the AR that shares
85% amino acid identity with the homologous region
in their respective steroid-binding domains. Third,
Arg differs markedly from Cys or His, physiocochemically.
To prove pathogenicity, we created recombinant
hAR cDNA expression vectors containing each of the
transitions, and we transiently transfected one or the
other into COS-1 cells. At 37°C the AR made in these
cells had either barely measurable androgen-binding
activity (Arg773Cys) or an abundant amount of an
abnormal form of it (Arg773His). These results
matched those for genital skin fibroblasts of the subjects. Furthermore, the Arg773His AR required a
higher concentration of androgen to achieve the same
maximum GH reporter gene response as was achieved
by the normal AR. This could be explained easily both
by its decreased affinity for androgen and by the increased turnover of its A-R complexes in the pro-

longed presence of androgen. In addition, the intrinsic
transactivational competence of these complexes may
be subnormal.
The strikingly different mutant AR phenotypes of
the two codon 773 substitutions will help to elucidate
several physicochemical properties of the AR. For instance, Arg773Cys may disrupt androgen binding and
retention more, and may cause greater AR thermolability, than does Arg773His, because Cys forms intramolecular disulfide bonds (Wilson et al. 1986).
Marcelli et al. (1991la) compared a natural Cys substitution with an artificial methionine one at Arg773.
In extracts of transfected cells, both caused thermal
instability of androgen binding, but only the former
affected its affinity. It should be noted that the genital
skin fibroblasts of their subject with Arg773Cys appear to have a sevenfold-reduced steady-state level of
AR mRNA, and they consider this a factor in the
pathogenesis of their subject's clinical phenotype of
complete androgen insensitivity, partly in view of the
mutant's 4%-8% residual transactivational capacity
as observed with the MMTV-CAT system. In contrast, we found normal levels of AR mRNA in the
cells of subjects with either Arg773 mutation, and
Arg773His produces complete androgen insensitivity
while disturbing the androgen-binding function of the
AR much less than does Arg773Cys.
The AR needs Arg773 to support augmentation
(up-regulation) of androgen-binding activity in normal genital skin fibroblasts during extended incubation with androgen (Kaufman et al. 1983; Gottlieb et
al. 1987). The fact that prolonged androgen exposure

Rates of dissociation, and 340C, of MB-, DHT- and MT-receptor complexes formed in COS-1 cells transfected with
pSVhAR (unblackened symbols) or pSVhAR.Arg773His (blackened symbols). In other experiments, the slower rate of dissociation of
mutant MT-receptor complexes at 340C permitted observations at several time points that were perfectly coordinate with the single one
shown here.

augments androgen binding in COS-1 cells containing
a normal hAR cDNA controlled by the SV40 early
promoter affirms the view (Krongrad et al. 1991) that
the mechanism is posttranscriptional, very probably
by AR stabilization. Indeed, the loss of binding observed, under replicate conditions, when Arg773His
is transfected instead indicates, in contrast, that formation of mutant A-R complexes destabilizes the AR.
In this light, the intrinsic transregulatory competence
of mutants such as Arg773His will only be measurable

by systems of cotransfection or in vitro transcription
that nullify-or, at least, weigh the complication ofmutant A-R complex instability.
Both codon 773 mutations described here involved
G:C-A:T transitions. This coincides with the propensity of cytosines at CpG dinucleotides to methylate
and to spontaneously deaminate to thymines (Barker
et al. 1984). That they are mutational hot spots is
supported by our identification of four mutations at
this site among the first 19 families with complete

Androgen Resistance: hAR Arg773Cys or His
androgen insensitivity in whom we have defined AR
mutations. Indeed, of all such mutations known, Arg773Cys has been among the earliest to be reported
from the United States (Brown et al. 1990; Tilley et
al. 1990), France (Mebarki et al. 1990), and Canada
(Trifiro et al. 1989).
Somatic and germinal mosaicism for single-gene
mutations in humans has become well documented
recently, thanks to the tools of molecular genetics. For
X-linked disorders, affected males and females have
been recognized (Maddalena et al. 1988; Gitschier et
al. 1989; Bakker et al. 1989). The mother of family
1 must be a somatic-germinal mosaic, because her peripheral lymphocyte DNA does not carry the Arg773Cys mutation, although she had two 46,XY daughters
affected with it. Since her sister's menarche was delayed to age 18 years, which occasionally is a sign of
heterozygosity due to random X-chromosome inactivation, it is probable that she herself was a heterozygous zygote whose mutant gene back-mutated (reverted) to the normal allele. Unfortunately, we were
not permitted to prove this.
Note added in proof. - We have discovered that the
transfected Arg773Cys AR is thermostable at 370C in
the absence of androgen and that its thermolability
at 370C in the presence of androgen is reversible at
220C.
