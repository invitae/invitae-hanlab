n inherited type of amyloidosis was suspected in an individual of Italian descent
who presented with vitreous opacities. Although no family history of amylOidosis
was apparent, the patient's transthyretin gene was examined and found not to possess
any of the known transthyretin mutations. Complete DNA sequencing revealed a substitution of adenine for thymine in the second base of codon 84 causing an amino acid
change of asparagine for isoleucine. The mutation was confirmed by demonstrating the
loss of an Sfa N1 restriction endonuclease site. Allele-specific DNA amplification by
polymerase chain reaction also was used to confirm the mutation. Either of these tests
can be used for diagnosis. Asparagine 84 represents the second mutation associated
with amyloidosis to occur at codon 84. Ophthalmology 1992;99:503-508

that have the extracellular deposition of insoluble fibrils
in a number of organ systems. The diseases are classified

of deposition (systemic or localized) of the amyloid fibrils
(Table 1). The systemic forms of amyloidosis generally
correspond to defined clinical patterns termed primary,
secondary, hereditary, and dialysis-associated amyloidosis. 1 Primary (also termed AL) amyloidosis is a plasma
cell dyscrasia usually accompanied by an M-component
in the serum or urine. The amyloid deposits are composed
of immunoglobulin light chains or fragments thereof.
Secondary (also termed AA) amyloidosis develops in some
persons after years of a chronic infectious or inflammatory
disease. The amyloid deposits are composed of AA protein, which is a fragment of the acute phase protein, serum
amyloid A protein. Familial amyloidosis occurs as an autosomal dominant disease most frequently associated with
a mutant form of the protein transthyretin (also called
prealbumin).2 Other more rare inherited forms of amyloidosis are caused by deposition of fragments of mutant
forms of plasma gelsolin (in Finnish polyneuropathy with
lattice corneal dystrophy), apolipoprotein AI, and cystatin
C. 3-5 Still other amyloidoses include those due to fj2-microglobulin deposition in patients on chronic hemodialysis, and several localized forms where amyloid fibril
deposition occurs in endocrine organs and the brain.

The transthyretin hereditary amyloidoses are the most
likely of all of the forms to be seen by ophthalmologists.
Vitreous opacities are frequent findings, and a scalloped
pupil also has been noted. 6 ,7 The disease onset is usually
after the third decade and associated with findings of
polyneuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and vitreous opacities.
Death occurs 5 to 15 years later due to cardiomyopathy
or complications of autonomic neuropathy.
Amyloid fibrils are composed of a mutant form ofthe
protein transthyretin, which is a tetrameric protein in
serum. Its monomer contains 127 amino acids, and its
secondary structure is predominantly beta pleated sheet. 8
A number of mutations resulting in single amino acid
substitutions have been identified that lead to amyloidosis,
including val-30-met, val-30-ala, phe-33-ile, phe-33-leu,
ala-36-pro, leu-58-his, thr-60-ala, ser-77-tyr, ile-84-ser, his90-asn, leu-Ill-met, and val-l 22-ile. 9-20
In this study, we examined a woman ofItalian descent
in whom there was no family history of amyloidosis. Her
disease manifestations of vitreous opacities and cardiomyopathy led us to suspect the hereditary form of amyloidosis. A new transthyretin mutation was found in
her DNA.

Materials and Methods
Family Study
The proband was referred to the Clinical Research Center
at age 67 for an evaluation of amyloid disease after a
vitrectomy revealed amyloidotic vitreous opacities. At age
62, the patient first noted clouding of her vision. Approximately 2 years later, her visual acuity was 20/400 in
the right eye. She underwent a pars plana vitrectomy on
her right eye and postoperatively her visual acuity corrected to 20/50. Subsequently, similar findings prompted
a vitrectomy on her left eye. She has very few other manifestations of amyloid disease, with only a mild cardiomyopathy and a carpal tunnel syndrome (now at age 73).
She does not have autonomic neuropathy, renal disease,
or gastrointestinal disease. Her bone marrow is normal
and a serum protein electrophoresis does not show an Mcomponent.

The proband (11-5) is from a large American family of
northern Italian descent (Fig 1). There is no family history
of amyloidosis. Her mother was well until age 90, when
she died of a stroke. Her father died suddenly at age 62.
One sibling, 11-3, died of a heart attack at age 50. The
other siblings were not examined by us, but none report
symptoms suggestive of amyloidosis.
The proband's presenting finding of vitreous opacities
was strongly suggestive of a diagnosis of familial amyloidosis due to a mutant TTR, even though no family
history was apparent. Her DNA was examined for the
known TTR mutations that occur in exons 2 and 3 and
cause familial amyloidosis. Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) amplification of the exons was carried out, followed
by appropriate restriction endonuclease digestion and gel
electrophoresis. No mutation was found. The members
of this family gave informed consent for examination of
their DNA under a protocol approved by the Institutional
Review Board.

DNA Isolation and Amplification
Blood was collected from the proband and six of her siblings. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood
by the method of Skare et al. 2l Exons 2,3, and 4 of the
transthyretin genes were amplified by PCR using 20-base
oligonucleotides as primers (Oligo's Etc. Inc, Guilford,

bromide and photographed under ultraviolet light. Exon
3 PCR products from 6 of the proband's siblings were
similarly digested and examined.

Asymmetric PCR Amplification

To confirm the mutant DNA sequence, a mutation-specific primer (TCATGGAATGGGGAGT) (Oligos Etc.
Inc, Guilford, CT) complementary to positions 166 to
181 was used to amplify the proband's genomic DNA
(Table 3). Two hundred nanograms of genomic DNA were
mixed with 100 ng of the primer from the 5' end of exon
3 and 100 ng of a mutation-specific primer. Gene Amp
reagents were added for a total reaction volume of 30 JLl.
There were 30 cycles consisting of 30 seconds at 94°C,
60 seconds at 60° C, and 30 seconds at 70° C. Additional
amplifications were performed at annealing temperatures
of 55° C and 65° C. Eight microliters of each reaction
mixture were electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide gels,
stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed under
ultraviolet light.

Two microliters ofPCR product were removed and mixed
with 200 ng of the sense primer and 4 ng of the antisense
primer (ratio of 1:50) and the GeneAmp DNA amplification kit reagents to a final reaction volume of 100 JLl.
This mixture was amplified for a total of 30 cycles as
described above. Phenol and chloroform extraction was
followed by spin dialysis using the Centricon 30 microconcentrator (Amicon, Danvers, MA), according to the
technique of Nichols et al. 14 Approximately 50 JLI of singlestranded PCR product were collected at the end.
DNA Sequencing
DNA sequencing was performed from both ends of each
amplified exon using a modification of the dideoxy termination sequencing technique of Sanger et al. 23 For each
sequence, 10 JLI of the single stranded PCR product was
added to lOng of the appropriate primer and the reactions
performed as previously reported. IO,12,13,18

Hydrophilicity Profile
Hydrophilicity profiles for normal TTR and for mutant
TTR were generated based on the known amino acid sequence using the DNA Inspector 11+ computer program
(Textco, W Lebanon, NH).

RFLP Analysis
DNA sequencing revealed a heterozygosity at codon 84,
which would eliminate a restriction site for Sfa N1. This
was tested by incubating 200 ng of the proband's doublestranded PCR product from exon 3 with 0.5 units of Sfa
N1 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The products
were electrophoresed on a 13 cm, 6% polyacrylamide gel

Results
Asymmetric PCR amplification of exons 2, 3, and 4 of
the proband's TTR gene (which encode amino acids 4127 of the mature protein) was performed followed by
DNA sequencing. A single heterozygous substitution of

adenine for thymine was found in the second base of codon 84 (Fig 2). The amino acid change at this position
was predicted to be asparagine for isoleucine.
The DNA mutation created the loss of a restriction site
for the enzyme Sfa N 1. Figure 3 shows the results of amplified exon 3 digested with Sfa N 1. DNA from the proband shows uncut DNA of260 bp as well as two fragments
of 172 bp with a 4 base tail and 84 bp with a 4 base tail
indicating the proband had both normal and mutant
transthyretin (Fig 3h). Normal DNA shows only the two
fragments (Fig 3g).
Sfa Nl will cut DNA at a recognition site composed
of the nucleotides OCATe. In transthyretin exon 3, these
5 nucleotides encompass the last 2 bases of codon 83 and
all 3 bases of codon 84. Thus, the loss of this restriction
site is not specific for the T to A change in the second
base of codon 84 present in our proband but could occur
with 15 different base changes reflecting 10 different amino
acid substitutions including the previously characterized
ser 84.24
To confirm the specific DNA sequence change an allele-specific oligonucleotide primer was prepared and used
for PCR. When an annealing temperature of 55° C was
used, a 181 bp band was evident in the proband's amplified DNA (Fig 3e). In addition, several large bands unrelated to transthyretin were present. At an annealing
temperature of 60° C, a more prominent 240 bp band
was noted with a lessening oflarger unrelated DNA bands
(Fig 3c). At an annealing temperature of 65° C, no PCR
product was synthesized (Fig 3a). DNA from six of the
proband's siblings retained the Sfa Nl restriction site and
had no transthyretin PCR product using the allele-specific
primer (data not shown).

The origin of the extraneous bands was investigated
by blot hybridization using 32P-labeled transthyretin
cDNA probe. As seen in Figure 4, only the doublestranded and single-stranded allele-specific PCR products
hybridized with the transthyretin cDNA. The extraneous
bands are not derived from the transthyretin gene. These
bands serve as an indication that the PCR functioned,
even in those cases where no allele-specific transthyretin
product was synthesized.
The substitution of asparagine for isoleucine increased
the hydrophilicity of the mutant transthyretin (Fig 5). We
have discovered similar changes in the hydrophilicity with
other amyloidogenic transthyretin mutations. 13 ,18

Discussion
In this article, we report the first transthyretin substitution
of asparagine for isoleucine at position 84 of the 127 amino
acid transthyretin molecule. It is associated with amyloidosis in a patient of Italian origin in whom no family

Vitreous opacities are recognized complications of
amyloid disease. 6 When a family history is not apparent,
vitreous opacities have often been called a manifestation
of primary amyloidosis. However, it has never been
proven that the amyloid fibrils of vitreous opacities are
composed of immunoglobulin light chain proteins, which
would confirm their identity as deposits typical of primary
amyloidosis. In fact, in a large study by Doft et al,25 vitreous opacities were most frequently associated with
transthyretin amyloidosis.
Transthyretin functions as a carrier of thyroid hormone
and vitamin A via retinol binding protein. The transport
of vitamin A to the retina via transthyretin may predispose
the vitreous to higher concentrations of transthyretin than
other body fluids and thus create a site for amyloid fibrillogenesis to occur. A number of different transthyretin
mutations have resulted in vitreous opacities as a prominent symptom of the disease. Notably, a different DNA
mutation of thymine to guanine in the same (second) base
of codon 84 has resulted in a different amino acid substitution (serine for isoleucine) in a kinship of Swiss origin
who live in Indiana and have amyloidosis. 24 Like our proHydrophilicity Plot

history is apparent and disease expression was first noted
as vitreous opacities.
It is of interest but not unusual that no family history
is apparent in patients with transthyretin mutations associated with amyloidosis. Often, as in our patient, relatives in other countries have lost contact. Also, an older
age of disease expression may mean family members die
of other causes before symptoms are apparent or diagnoses
may not be recognized as associated with an inherited
condition. Our patient presented with vitreous opacities
and had minimal or no symptomatology that is usually
associated with hereditary amyloidosis. Thus, older onset,
lack of contact with relatives, and minimal symptomatology may contribute to lack of apparent family history.
It is likely that the proband's mutation was new within
her family. The lack of the transthyretin DNA mutation
in 6 of our proband's siblings supports this, since the
chance that only she inherited the abnormality from a
parent is 1 in 64. This statistic of chance is not biased by
examining only healthy surviving siblings, as the presence
of the trait would not be expected to be associated with
an early death in family members with no history of
symptoms. One of the living siblings has not yet been
tested. It is possible that the proband's father might have
carried the trait and died before it was expressed.

band, the Indiana Swiss kindred had relatively late onset
disease and suffered from cardiomyopathy and carpal
tunnel syndrome as well as from vitreous opacities.
We propose that other patients with vitreous opacities
also may have the mutant transthyretin hereditary form
of amyloidosis, and that patients with visual opacities
should be checked for transthyretin gene mutations even
when there is no clear family history of the disease.
