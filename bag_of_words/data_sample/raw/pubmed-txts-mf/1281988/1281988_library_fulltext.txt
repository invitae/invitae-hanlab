Since direct
sequencing
of the products
from cDNA of patient
JT revealed
only the mutant
"T" at position
1141, the patient
could
be either
homozygous
for the mutation
or a compound heterozygote
with a second mutant
allele
that is not transcribed
or results
in
unstable
mRNA.
To distinguish
between
these
possibilities,
the
area containing
the G1141+T transition
in genomic DNA was amplified
and sequenced.
The result
demonstrated
that
in JT genomic
DNA,
only "TV' was present
at the site corresponding
to the cDNA position
1141; whereas
in control
(B142) genomic
DNA only lVGVVwas present
(data not shown).
It is concluded
that
the transition
of G1i4i+T
in JT is homozygous.
If JT is homozygous
for the G1141+T transition,
then parents
must be heterozygous.
Unfortunately,
cells
from father
JT could
not be obtained.
However,
analysis
of cDNA (Fig.

DNA (not shown) from mother JT revealed
her to be heterozygous

stop codon was described
in seven other
fucosidosis
patients
and a
deletion
of at least
2 exons at the 3'-end
of the a-L-fucosidase
gene was reported
in two additional
patients
(2-4).
The mutant

gene of JT cells

synthesis
of a-Lfucosidase
protein
and result
in production
of a truncated
mutant
polypeptide
with a molecular
mass about 10,000 lower than the wild
type control
enzyme.

contradiction
can be reconciled
by the occurrence
of either
of two
natural
phenomena
that have been described
in high eucaryotes
(18-20).
One is a +1 or -1 frameshift,
permitting
reading
in the
region
of the mutant stop codon.
However,
this would result
in the
generation
of additional
stop codons shortly
downstream
from the
frameshift.
Thus, the occurrence
of a frameshift
is unlikely.
The
other
is the
reading
of the
stop
codon
by an aminoacyl-tRNA
resulting
in insertion
of an amino acid and suppression
of the stop
signal.
This could
result
in synthesis
of a mutant
readthrough
polypeptide
with a molecular
size indistinguishable
from wild type
on an electrophoresis
gel.
No a-L-fucosidase
activity
was measurable
in cultures
of JT
lymphoid
cells
which
contained
sufficient
intracellular
immunoreactive
a-L-fucosidase
protein
(4% of
control)
to
be
detected
by the enzyme assay (6).
This can be explained
if Glu-375
in the normal
protein
is essential
for enzyme activity
and this
residue
was replaced
in the mutant readthrough
protein
by an amino
acid not compatible
with enzyme function.
Our data suggests
an apparent
readthrough
of the mutant
stop
codon in JT lymphoid
cells.
A review
of the literature
indicates
that
these data are the first
evidence
of this
for a human genetic
disease
(18).
This may reflect
a natural
mechanism
attempting
to
correct
deleterious
mutations,
but which obviously
failed
in the
case at hand.
