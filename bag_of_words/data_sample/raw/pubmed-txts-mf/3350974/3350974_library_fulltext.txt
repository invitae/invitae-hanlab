Abstract
Antithrombin Rouen-II, a new inherited variant of antithrombin-III, was found in two members of a family with no definite
history of thrombosis. The subjects had normal antigenic concentrations of antithrombin and normal progressive inhibitory
activity. However, the variant had defective heparin and heparan -sulfate cofactor activities, and was not activated by a
synthetic pentasaccharide representing the minimum heparin
sequence.

The abnormal antithrombin was isolated using heparinSepharose chromatography, and on electrophoresis at pH 8.6
migrated more anodally than normal. Two-dimensional peptide
mapping of tryptic and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease
digests was performed and the abnormal peptide was located
by tryptophan staining. Amino acid sequence studies demonstrated a substitution of arginine at residue 47 by a serine.
Evidence strongly suggests that arginine 47 is a prime heparin binding site in antithrombin and that it forms part of a
proposed positively charged linear site (to which heparin
binds) that stretches across the surface of the molecule from
the A to the D helix.

Introduction
Antithrombin (antithrombin-III) a member of the serpin superfamily (1), is the major inhibitor of thrombin and several
other coagulation seine proteases. It plays an important physiological role in controlling the coagulation cascade. Inherited
quantitative deficiencies of antithrombin result in an increased
risk of thromboembolic disease (2).
The formation of the inactive protease-antithrombin complexes is greatly accelerated by commercial heparins or by
endothelial, heparin-like substances (3) which are most likely
to be one of the heparan sulfates (4).
The mechanism by which heparin activates the protease
inhibitory activity of antithrombin remains puzzling, but

some illuminating data have recently emerged. The antithrombin binding sequence in heparin is a unique specific
pentasaccharide (5) bearing at least four sulfate groups that
play an essential role in this interaction (6). On the other hand,
the localization of the heparin binding site on antithrombin
remains uncertain. The first clues have come either from
chemically modified antithrombins or from molecular characterization of natural mutant inhibitors. In vitro alteration of
the tryptophan 49 (7) or of lysine residues (8) prevent the
heparin acceleration of the inhibitory activity without affecting the progressive protease inhibitor interaction when the
mucopolysaccharide is absent. Only five variants of antithrombin with impaired heparin binding ability have been
extensively studied. In four of them, arginine at residue 47 is
replaced either by a cysteine in antithrombin Toyama (9),
Tours (10), and Alger (11), or by a histidine in the vanant
Rouen-I we recently reported (12). The fifth one, antithrombin Basel, has a Pro to Leu substitution at residue 41 (13).
We describe in this paper the qualitative investigations and
the molecular characterization of a new inherited antithrombin mutant, Rouen-II. Rouen-II has normal progressive inhibitory activity but defective heparin binding and low heparin
and heparan sulfate cofactor activities which occur as a result
of the replacement of arginine 47 by seine. This variant provides new evidence that arginine 47 is a prime site in antithrombin for the binding of heparin and endothelial mucopolysaccharides.

Methods
Case report. The propositus, a 40-yr-old man suffering from hypertriglyceridemia, was admitted to hospital because of a sudden myocardial infarction that lacked extensive coronary artery disease (this was
found out through angiography). As a result of standard investigations

he was found to have an abnormal antithrombin. There was no previous familial history of thrombosis, but his 13-yr-old daughter displayed the same antithrombin abnormality.
Antithrombin measurements in plasma. Antithrombin concentration was quantified by Laurell electroimmunoassay (14). Qualitative
determinations were carried out by amidolytic methods using synthetic chromogenic substrates ofthrombin (IIa) or Factor Xa. Progressive anti-Ila activity was assayed with S2238 from Kabi (Flow, Puteaux, France) and human Ila, as proposed by Aiach (15), progressive
anti-Xa activity was evaluated with CBS 3139 (Serbio, Asnieres,
France) according to Odegard (16). Antithrombin activity was evaluated in the presence of heparin using the reagent kit of Diagnostica
Stago (Asnieres, France) on a discrete analyzer as recommended by
Aiach (17): 5 ,ul of plasma were diluted in 500 j,l of pH 8.7, Tris buffer

containing an excess of bovine thrombin and 3 IU/ml heparin. After a
20-s incubation time, 100 l of chromo-thrombin was added and the
increase in absorbance recorded during 40 s. Antithrombin activity
was also measured in the presence of purified heparan sulfate (HS Ila),
obtained from B. Casu (18), using an end-point method: 200 Al of
plasma (diluted 1:10 in Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 8.4, containing 2.25 US
Pharmacopeia U/ml heparan sulfate) were incubated with 200 z1 bovine thrombin during 30 s; 200 Al of CBS 3447 was added and the
reaction was stopped after 60 s. Anti-Factor Xa activity was evaluated
in the presence of 3 IU/ml heparin or 1 I.C. anti-Xa U/ml synthetic
pentasaccharide (IC 851589; a gift from Institut Choay, Paris, France)
with the same conditions as for heparan sulfate cofactor activity, but in
the presence of bovine Factor Xa and CBS 3139 (from Stachrom
heparin reagent kit, Diagnostica Stago). Results are expressed in percentage of control plasma, which comprised a pool of 20 normal
plasmas.

Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of antithrombin. This was
achieved according to Sas' method (19), with or without the addition in
the first dimension of 25 IU/ml unfractionated heparin or of 25 antiXa I.C. U/ml low molecular weight heparin (CY 222; Institut Choay,
mean molecular weight, 2,500).
Purification and characterization of antithrombin. Antithrombin
was isolated on heparin-Sepharose as previously described (12). Electrophoresis on agarose and SDS polyacrylamide, '4C-carboxymethylation and proteolytic digestion with trypsin and S. aureus V8 protease,
thin layer peptide mapping, HPLC peptide separations, and peptide
sequencing were performed as previously described ( 12).
Antithrombin activation studies. These were performed using purified normal and propositus antithrombins, adjusted to equal antigenic
concentration by varying both the heparin concentration (0.1, 0.5, 5.0
IU) and the ionic strength of the phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (isotonic, 2x
isotonic, 3x isotonic). 0.2 Mg of purified antithrombin was added to
600 Al of buffer, pH 7.4, which contained heparin. Excess thrombin
(10 Al of Parke Davis, Detroit, topical bovine thrombin diluted 15 ,l to
1 ml) was added and, after 20 min, 25 MA of Chromozym-TH (5 mg/ml)
was added and the increase in absorbance was monitored at 405 nm.

Results
The propositus and his daughter both demonstrated the same
antithrombin abnormality in their plasmas (Table I). Immunoreactive levels and progressive activities of antithrombin
were within the normal range, whereas heparin cofactor activities measured by antithrombin or anti-Factor Xa assays were
decreased to 64-70% of the control, and heparan sulfate coTable L Antithrombin Levels* in the Propositus

factor activity evaluated by an anti-Ila measurement was
equally low at 60 and 68%, respectively, of the control. In the
same way, the pentasaccharide only partially potentiated inhibition of Factor Xa in the patient's plasma.
Normal patterns were obtained by crossed immunoelectrophoresis in the absence of heparin. But in the presence of
unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin, normal antithrombin migrated as a major, more anodal peak,
while both abnormal plasmas displayed a double-peak pattern;
one peak had the same fast mobility as the control, the other
had the same slower migration as antithrombin in the absence
of heparin (gels not shown).
The results of heparin-Sepharose chromatography of the
patient's plasma at pH 7.4 show heterozygosity for an antithrombin of decreased heparin binding affinity (Fig. 1). The
variant antithrombin eluted with 0.45 mol/liter NaCl compared with the normal antithrombin which eluted at 0.95
mol/liter. Quantitation by electroimmunoassay confirmed the
presence of an excess of variant compared with the normal
component (Table II). The activities of the two separate fractions were also compared (as seen on Table II) using the experimental conditions described for the plasma measurements.
The abnormal fraction had normal progressive inhibition activity but defective heparin or pentasaccharide cofactor activities.
The thrombin inhibitory activity of purified Rouen-II and
normal antithrombin were compared in PBS that was two or
three times its isotonic strength with varying amounts of heparin (Fig. 2). This showed that the variant antithrombin was
incompletely activated in the presence of low levels of heparin
when there was sufficient competition from the sodium and
chloride ions for the charged groups on heparin and antithrombin. At the concentrations of heparin used in the experiment there was no significant difference between Rouen-II
and normal antithrombin-III under isotonic conditions. However, at 2x isotonic concentration Rouen-II showed < 50%
activity at the low heparin level. The difference in activity
between normal antithrombin and Rouen-I1 is even more dramatic in 3X isotonic strength buffer. Here Rouen-I1 with 5.0 U
of heparin had less activity than normal antithrombin with 0.5
U of heparin.
Electrophoresis in agarose at pH 8.6 showed that the abnormal antithrombin migrated faster (more anodally) than
normal, implying that the variant had an increased negative
charge. SDS-PAGE showed the molecular weight of normal
and abnormal antithrombins to be identical at 56,000.
A series of peptide maps were prepared of both the normal
and abnormal antithrombins. These were identical apart from
a consistent finding in both tryptic and V8 protease maps of a
shifted tryptophan-containing peptide. Normal tryptic maps

showed three tryptophan-staining peptides whereas Rouen-II
had only two. This suggested that the abnormality had occurred within residues 47-53. The V8 maps gave two tryptophan peptides from both normal and abnormal antithrombins, with the peptide corresponding to residues 43-50 being
shifted. The amino acid composition of the implicated peptides showed an arginine to be missing in the variant, but the
identity of the new amino acid could not be unequivocally
determined from the peptide maps. The tryptic peptide, residues 47-53, was isolated from both normal and Rouen-II digests by reversed phase HPLC using 49-mmol/liter phosphate
buffer, pH 2.9, and an increasing concentration gradient of
acetonitrile. The peptide was rerun on reversed phase HPLC in
0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with increasing acetonitrile. The peptides were monitored at 215 nm, and to detect the tryptophan-peptides, also at 280 nm. Amino acid sequence studies
were performed on these peptides. These showed that arginine,
which was at position 1 in the normal tryptic peptide, had been
replaced by a serine. This corresponds to position 47 in the
intact protein.

Discussion

Rouen-II is a new genetic variant ofantithrombin with normal
progressive inhibitory activity, but decreased cofactor activity,
with both unfractionated or synthetic pentasaccharide heparins. As demonstrated by crossed immunoelectrophoresis with

both types of heparin, and also by heparin-Sepharose chromatography, this dysfunction is due to impaired heparin binding
as has been previously demonstrated in other analogous variants (9-13, 20-23). The biochemical defect in Rouen-II was
demonstrated by repeated peptide maps of both tryptic and V8
protease digests on thin layer plates, and by HPLC. These
showed a single consistent difference in peptides overlapping
residue 47. Sequence analysis showed this difference to be due
to the replacement of the arginine normally present at position
47 by a serine. This mutation incidentally creates an unused oligosaccharide attachment site at position 45, i.e., Asn-

Arg-Ser.

The identification of the mutation in antithrombin
Rouen-II as 47 arginine to serine, is not a surprise. Among the
seven other genetic variants so far identified (9-13, 24, 25)
four with impaired heparin binding involve mutations of arginine 47: to cysteine in the independently observed variants
Toyama (9), Tours (10), and Alger (11), and to histidine in
Rouen-I (12). One reason for this recurrence of mutations at
position 47 may be the susceptibility of the DNA codon for
this arginine, CGT, to base substitutions; in particular, the
replacement of arginine 47 by a cysteine is due to a thymine
for cytosine substitution, a particularly frequent DNA mutation (26). Recurrent mutations in hemophilia A also provide
evidence that CG dinucleotides are "hotspots" for mutations
in man (27). However, the occurrence of three different mutations at the one site (to cysteine, to histidine, and to serine) all
provide evidence of the critical role played by arginine 47 in
the binding of heparin by antithrombin.
The results shown in Fig. 2 support the deduction that

heparin binds to antithrombin by ionic bonding (salt-bridges)
between the negatively charged sulfates of the heparin and
positively charged basic amino acids (arginines and lysines) of
antithrombin. Increasing salt concentrations compete for
these bonds and diminish the heparin affinity particularly in
the absence of arginine 47 in Rouen-II.
Several recent reports provide evidence that antithrombin
can be activated on vascular heparin-like substances. This
pathway could be responsible, in part, for the nonthrombogenic properties of endothelium (28). Among these substances,
heparan sulfate proteoglycans bind with high affinity via sulfated saccharides similar to those of the unique pentasaccharide sequence of commercial heparin (29). The activation of
Rouen-II by anticoagulantly active heparan sulfate is defective
and from this we deduce that arginine 47 is also a prime site for
binding to endothelial proteoglycans. As we previously noticed
(30), the incidence of thrombosis in heterozygous antithrombin variants with defective heparin binding is very low compared with that observed in quantitative defects or other types
of variants. In the Rouen-II family, there is no definite history
of thrombosis; the variant antithrombin retains its progressive
activity, and as shown in Fig. 2, also has the potential to be
activated by heparin though less readily than normal antithrombin. The observation of a greater concentration of the
variant vs. the normal antithrombin (Table II) suggests increased consumption of the normal component and hence
decreased functional activity of the variant. It is possible that
this decreased in vivo functional activity of antithrombin
Rouen-II was a factor that contributed to the coronary thrombosis of the propositus. Indeed, the homozygous patient for
antithrombin Alger, with complete loss of heparan sulfate
binding, does suffer from thromboembolic disease (22).

The results shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that the defect in
the Rouen-II variant is one of heparin (or heparan) binding
and not of heparin activation. The identification of Rouen-II
together with other variants of arginine 47, led us (with P. C.
Christey and D. R. Boswell) to look at other basic residues that
are uniquely conserved in the two heparin-activated serpins,
antithrombin and heparin cofactor-II, and which might therefore be involved in the binding of heparin (31). Using computer alignments ofthe serpin family it is possible to determine
homologous residues and project them (1) on the known crystallographic structure of the archetype of the family, alpha- 1antitrypsin (32). Seven such basic residues occur and five of
them, including arginine 47, are plotted in Fig. 3 to give a
proposed binding site for heparin. Further evidence for this
binding site is given by the identification of asparagine 135 as
the site of the oligosaccharide chain whose absence gives the
increased natural affinity variant, beta-antithrombin (33), and
also by the independent evidence of Blackburn that lysine 125
is directly involved in heparin binding (34).
The proposed binding site, as shown in Fig. 3, primarily
involves the A and D helices, and is projected on the cleaved,
postcomplex structure of alpha-l-antitrypsin (32). Reconstruction of the native structure in both antitrypsin and antithrombin involves a change in conformation but observations based on space-filling models make it unlikely that this
transition is accompanied by gross alterations of the A and D
helices (31).
Altogether then there is good evidence that heparin (and
inferentially heparan) bind to a positively charged linear site
extending across the molecule from arginine 47, as shown in
Fig. 3. There is as yet no direct evidence as to how the binding

Christey, and Boswell, with permission, reference 31). Positively
charged residues uniquely conserved in antithrombin and heparin
cofactor-II form a positive site stretching across the molecule from
the A helix (47 Arg) to the D helix (125 Lys, 129 Arg, 132 Arg) and
adjacent 133 Lys. Loss of the negatively charged oligosaccharide at
position 135 gives increased heparin affinity (33). The crystallographic skeleton is that of alpha- I -antitrypsin cleaved at its active
center. The arrows show, to the left, the position of the active center

native inhibitor.

of heparin activates the inhibitory function of the molecule;
presumably there is an accompanying conformational change.
Evidence for the events involved in this activation will come
from the study of variants that bind heparin but do not activate it, and ultimately from crystallographic studies of antithrombin that show its three-dimensional conformation in
the presence of heparin.
