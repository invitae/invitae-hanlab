The sterol storage disorder cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is characterized by abnormal deposition of cholesterol and cholestanol in multiple tissues.
Deposition in the central nervous system leads to neurological dysfunction marked by dementia, spinal cord
paresis, and cerebellar ataxia. Deposition in other tissues causes tendon xanthomas, premature atherosclerosis, and cataracts. In two unrelated patients with
CTX, we have identified different point mutations in
the gene (CYP27) encoding sterol 27-hydroxylase, a
key enzyme in the bile acid biosynthesis pathway.
Transfection of mutant cDNAs into cultured cells results in the synthesis of immunoreactive sterol 27hydroxylase protein with greatly diminished enzyme
activity. We have localized the CYP27 gene to the q33qter interval of human chromosome 2, and to mouse
chromosome 1, in agreement with the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of CTX. These findings underscore the essential role played by sterols in the central
nervous system and suggest that mutations in other
sterol metabolizing enzymes may contribute to diseases
with neurological manifestations.

to involve either a sterol 27-hydroxylase (7) or a sterol 24hydroxylase (8).The mechanism by which a defect in hepatic
bile acid synthesis leads to the
diverse symptoms observed in
CTX is at present not known (4); however, the pleiotropic
nature of the disease does not appear to be related to hypercholesterolemia as a majority of CTX patients have normal
serum cholesterol levels (4).
To gain insight into this disease and to explore the link
between bile acids, sterols, and the nervous system, we recently isolated cDNA clones for the rabbit (9) and human
sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNAs (10). The enzyme encoded by
these cDNAs is a mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 that together with two protein cofactors, adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase, hydroxylatesa variety of sterols at theC-27
position (9-11). In thebile acid synthesis pathway, sterol27hydroxylase catalyzes the first step in the oxidation of the
side chain of sterolintermediates (12, 13).Hybridization
studies using thecloned rabbit cDNArevealed that sterol27hydroxylase mRNA was present in many different tissues and
that the mRNAwas encoded by a singlecopy gene (9). In this
paper, we describe the use of the human sterol27-hydroxylase
cDNA to determine a molecular basis for CTX and to map
the chromosomal locationof the gene.

and indicate that the CYP27 gene maps to thedistal portion
(q33-qter) of the long arm of chromosome 2. Thus CPY27 is
asyntenic with genes for 12 other subfamilies of cytochrome
P-450s and with the adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase
genes (26,30,31). Inexperiments not shown, the CYP27 gene

a large syntenic group of genes that have homologs on human
chromosome 2 (32).

autosomal localization of this gene to chromosome 2 in the
human and chromosome 1in the mouse.
In patient CTX1, a mutation encoding a cysteine in place
of an arginine was found (Fig. 3). The novel cysteine is located
at position 446 and is two amino acids away from a ubiquitously conserved cysteine of cytochrome P-450 proteins that
serves as aligand for the heme cofactor (33). In patientCTX2,
another arginine to cysteine encoding mutation was found
(Fig. 3). In thiscase, the novel cysteine occurs at position 362
in a sequence that is highly conserved among mitochondrial
cytochrome P-450s and that is thought to bind the adrenodoxin cofactor (34). Thus, in both cases, the observed mutationsarepresentinfunctional
domains of the sterol 27hydroxylase and would beexpected to disrupt enzyme activity.
This expectation was met in expression studies involving
cDNAs harboring the CTX mutations (Fig. 4). Interestingly,
both CTX mutationsoccurred in CG dinucleotides, which are
thought to be hypermutable in the human genome (35).
Although it is not yet certain that all forms of CTX are
caused by mutations inthe CYP27 gene, the results presented
here, together with previous physiological (36), biochemical
(7,37), andimmunochemical results (38) obtained with other
CTX subjects, suggest that this conclusion is warranted. On
the basis of our data, molecular assays can now be developed
for early diagnosis and carrier detection of CTX in populations like Sephardic Jews of Moroccan descent in whom the
frequency of this disease is very high (39, 40). Such assays
should prove especially valuable in CTX, since early treatment with bile acids can retard or even reverse the course of
the disease (41).
The presence of sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA in a variety
of tissues (9) suggests that this enzyme plays a multifaceted
role in sterol metabolism that extends beyond the synthesis
of bile acids in the liver. The deposition of sterols in the
neural tissues of CTX patients together with the occurrence
of a progressive neurological dysfunction (4) suggest that this
enzyme performs avital function in the nervous system.
Evidence for such a role is bolstered by the observation that
other sterol storage disorders that do not involve disruption
of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene, such as sistosterolemia (4),
are not characterized by central nervous system defects (42).
Sterol 27-hydroxylase may facilitate reverse sterol transport (43) in neural tissues or participate inthe redistribution
of sterols among cells of the central nervous system (44).
Alternatively, the enzyme may play a key regulatory role in
maintaining sterolhomeostasis, disruption of which maylead
to sterol accumulation (10). Data to support thesehypotheses
may come from the future analysis of sterol 27-hydroxylase
expression in extrahepatic tissues and in otherdisease states
with neurological manifestations.
