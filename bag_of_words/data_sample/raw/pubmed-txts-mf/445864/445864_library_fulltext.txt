In Finland, 19 children, born 1964-1977, from 13 families, have been diagnosed as suffering from nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH). This gives an incidence for NKH in the
Finnish population of 1:55,000 newborns. The majority of these children were born in the
northern part of the country, where the incidence is 1:12,000. The geographical distribution of the birth-places of the grandparents also seems to point towards an enrichment
of the gene in northern Finland. An autosomal recessive mode of inheritance for this
disease seems probable, since the corrected proportion of affected siblings (Apett’s a priori
method) is 0.288. Abnormally high plasma glycine concentration and elevated glycine
urinary excretion in the parents of the NKH-children suggest the existence of a minor
metabolic defect in heterozygotes of this disease. Some of the healthy siblings of the
NKH-patients also show similary elevated levels. However, a definite diagnosis of the
NKH-heterozygote state cannot easily be made on the basis of these laboratory findings,
as the levels in some individuals are very close to, or even overlap corresponding values
in a normal material.

Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) is a n
often lethal disorder of amino acid metabolism, characterized by rapidly progressing
neurological symptoms which generally appear during the first days of life, and are
probably caused by defective degradation of
glycine in brain tissue (Ando et al. 1968,
de Groot et al. 1970, Perry e t al. 1977).
T h e disease is a very rare one. I n addition
to 19 known Finnish patients with N K H ,
only some 50 cases have been reported
from other parts of the world (v. Wendt et
al. 1978b).
The initial clinical findings in a patient
suffering from N K H can b? confusingly
similar t o those in a number of other, more

frequently occurring disorders of the neonatal period, and the diagnosis can be confirmed only by biochemical analysis. Pathognomonic of N K H , and not encountered in
any other neurological disease, or even in
the secondary hyperglycinemias (such as
beta-ketolthiolase
deficiency,
isovaleric
acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia and propionic acidemia) is a very high level of
glycine in the cerebrospinal fluid in combination with a lowered plasma-CSF ratio for
this amino acid (Ando et al. 1971, Bachm a n et al. 1971, Morrow 1974, Perry e t al.
1975, Scriver & Sprague 1975). Nonketotic
hyperglycinemia differs from other types of
hyperglycinemia also in the lack of hemato-

logical disturbances, ketosis, metabolical
acidosis and osteoporosis (Baumgartner et
al. 1975, Corbeel et al. 1975). The prognosis for these children is poor; in the Finnish series only seven out of 19 children
survived the first year of life.
Although the clinical course has been as
rapidly progressive in most of the published
case-reports, seven patients have shown
only mild developmental delays (Bank &
Morrow 1972, Frazier et al. 1978, Holmgren & Blomquist 1977). Various therapeutic approaches to this disease have been
made, but as the underlying biochemical
defect has not been identified at an enzymatic level, no specific and effective
therapy has as yet been developed (de
Groot et al. 1970, Krieger et al. 1977,
Spielberg et al. 1976). Recent reports suggest, however, that the administration of
the glycine-antagonist, strychnine, improves
the condition of the NKH-patient (Chien
et al. 1978, Gitzelmann et al. 1977).
As the main therapeutic problems of
nonketotic hyperglycinemia are still unsolved, efforts should be directed towards
prevention, early detection of new cases
and genetic counselling of families with
NKH-children. In this paper, calculations
based on the 13 Finnish faminies with this
disease, and relating to the incidence, geographical distribution and mode of inheritance, are presented. Using a method, originally suggested by Tada & Ando (1964)
(who demonstrated elevated fasting glycine
plasma levels and a pathologic oral glycine
loading test in the parents of the first
Japanese child with hyperglycinemia), we
have evaluated the possibilities for the detection of NKH-heterozygotes (Tada &
Ando 1965).
Material and Methods

The equipment and methods necessary for
screening and diagnosing metabolic disease

are available in only two laboratories in
Finland. Samples from patients suspected
of suffering from metabolic disease are
therefore sent to these two centers in Helsinki and Oulu from all parts of the country.
The information on the 19 Finnish patients, born 1964-1977, was collected mainly by studying the records of these laboratories. As the methods for confirming the
diagnosis of NKH have undergone considerable development during the last decade,
slightly variable diagnostic criteria had to be
accepted. Thus, as definite cases of NKH
(Fig. l), we have considered all those 15
patients who fulfil at least four of the following criteria: a typical case-history, a 5fold increase of the CSF-glycine concentration and a lowered plasma-CSF glycine
ratio; a 2-fold elevation of plasma glycine
content; a 5-fold increase of urine glycine
excretion, and no signs of organic acidemia.
In the remaining four infants, the diagnostic procedures were incomplete, but
their inclusion in this material is justified
by the fact that an infant with a definite
diagnosis of NKH was later born into these
families (v. Wendt et al. 1978b).
Information necessary for studying the
genetic aspects of this disease was obtained
from parish records, and it was possible to
trace ancestors back five to ten generations.
Informed consent to participate in the
study of the possible detection of NKH
carrier state was obtained from 19 out of
26 parents.
Blood plasma and urine samples were
obtained from 13 out of 17 healthy siblings
of the patients. In order t o make calculations of glycine clearance, both samples
were collected during the same day. Diurnal urine was collected a t home, the blood
samples were taken at the nearest doctor’s
practice, and the analysis was performed
in our laboratory. Glycine was determined

test, the neurologic status remains normal
during the First few hours of life (de Groot
et al. 1977, Krieger et al. 1977).
In the Finnish cases, and in other reported cases, symptoms are usually observed during the first 2 days. The first
clinical signs of the disease are hypotonia
and lethargy, followed by myoclonic convulsions and lack of response to painful
stimuli (v. Wendt et a1 1978b.). A major
cause of death in the first weeks of life
seems to be a severe, progressive respiratory
depression, which if treated by assisted ventilation is reversible. At the time of this
study four Finnish patients suffering from
NKH are still alive and are all showing
signs of severe psychomotor retardation.

Incidence and Geographical Distribution
Calculations based on the 19 known cases
of NKH in Finland reveal a mean incidence
among Finnish newborns of 1:55,000. The
distribution is very variable throughout the
country, since the incidence in the two
northern-most districts (Lapland and the
district of Oulu) is 1:12,OOO. The birthplaces of the grandparents show a similar
geographical distribution (Fig. 3).

n priori method serves as a suitable correction for the proportion of siblings not affected. When taking into account all 1 9
cases, the figure derived is 0.288, which is
close enough to the theoretical value of
0.250 t o support the hypothesis that the
mode of inheritance for this disease is autosoma1 recessive.

Inheritance

All parents are of Finnish origin, except
one who belongs to a minor ethnic group,
the Skolt-Lapps. The ratio of affected males
to females is 1.4, and consanguinity could
be demonstrated in three out of 13 families
(Fig. 3). No ancestral connections could
be found between different families.
Bearing in mind the statistical limitations
of a small series, it can be assumed that
there is a close approach to complete truncate ascertainment, and therefore Apert's

GENETICS OF NKH

Heterozygotes
Considered as groups, both parents and
siblings of the NKH-patients exhibit a
pathologic fasting plasma glycine level and
high urinary excretion of glycine (Table 1).
A clearly abnormal tubular reabsorption
for glycine (RT9") was observed in only
one parent (52.8 %). The mean value for
tubular reabsorption of glycine was: in
parents 91.5 k 6.2 70;in siblings 92.2 5
4.9 %, with a normal range of 92.9-99.0 70
(Scriver & Davies 1965). If a plasma glycine
level exceeding the mean
2 SD (>348
pmoV1) is considered pathologic, I7 out of
19 parents fall into this group. Using an
identically constructed upper normal limit
(257 pmoV1) for children, 9 of the 13 siblings would be considered as probable
heterozygotes for the disease. The considerable overlap between plasma glycine values
of definite heterozygotes and healthy controls shows, however, that this analysis cannot be used as a definitive test for the
NKH-heterozygote state (Fig. 4). This overlap was not reduced by using other parameters, such as urinary excretion or renal
clearance of glycine. Furthermore, estimations of other amino acids in the body fluids
of these heterozygotes did not reveal the
significant abnormalities which have been
observed in Finnish NKH-patients (v. Wendt
et al. 1978a). Finally, in contrast to the
findings in the Japanese family with a
hyperglycinemic child, we were unable to
demonstrate any significant difference
between healthy controls and Finnish
heterozygotes when using the glycine loading test (0.2 g/kg body weight) (Tada &
Ando 1964).

ported from other countries, it can be assumed that nonketotic hyperglycinemia is
another metabolic disease with a high frequency in the Finnish population. The pattern of geographic distribution seems to
point towards an enrichment of the gene
in the northern part of the country, a phenomenon encountered in several other inherited metabolic diseases in Finland
(Norio et al. 1973). The diagnosis of NKH
is easily missed, as the disease is rapidly
progressive and, in a confusing way, mimics
other more frequently occurring diseases of
the newborn period (such as intraventrkular
hemorrhage, septicemia and meningitis). It
is therefore likely that NKH is underdiagnosed in Finland, as well as in other parts
of the world, which means that the true
incidence is probably higher than the calculated one. The high incidence of metabolic disease in the Finnish population has
given rise to the practice of performing
metabolic screening in newborns, even
when there is only a vagu5 suspicion of
such a disease. This fact, although there is no

416

routine screening programme for metabolic
disease in Finland, may contribute t o the
high incidence of N K H in this country.
T h e high plasma concentrations and elevated urinary excretion of glycine in the heterozygotes probably reflect a minor defect
of glycine metabolism.
I t might not be correct t o compare these
findings with the data on the parents of the
first Japanese infant reported with hyperglycinemia, since the published laboratory
findings d o not conclusively exclude the
possibility that this child might represent
a secondary or ketotic type of hyperglycinemia (Tada et al. 1963). Although the overlap of plasma glycine values between definite heterozygotes and healthy individuals
observed in this study reduces the discriminative efficacy of this test, a high
plasma level of glycine points strongly towards the carrier state of nonketotic hyperglycinemia. Since the basic enzymatic defect of N K H still remains unknown, there
is no method for confirming the diagnosis
of an N K H heterozygote state, although
defective degradation olf glycine has been
demonstrated in histologic specimens of
the liver and brain tissue of homozygotes
(de Groot et al. 1970, Perry et al. 1977).
As very severe pathologic changes are observed in the brain tissue of patients with
NKH, and minor intellectual dysfunction
has recently been reported in heterozygotes
of another metabolic disease (phenylketonuria), some preliminary observations
of slight abnormalities of CNS function in
Finnish heterozygotes of N K H could be
explained as the results of slightly abnormal metabolism of glycine in the nervous
system of these individuals (Bachmann et
al. 1971, Thalhammer 1978).
