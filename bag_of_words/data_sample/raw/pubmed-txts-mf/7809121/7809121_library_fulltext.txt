Electrophysiological evidence exists for a functional defect
in the skeletal muscle Na+ channel in patients with both HYPP
and PC (4-7), and recent genetic studies have confirmed that
HYPP and PC are allelic disorders of the skeletal muscle
voltage-gated sodium channel a-subunit gene (SCN4A,
17q23.1-q25.3) (8-10). There have been 14 missense SCN4A
mutations found in patients with either HYPP or PC; at least
five are associated with a typical PC phenotype (11-17). Many
of these identified mutations occur in regions of the Na+
channel protein for which little or no structure-function correlation exists. Therefore, the relationship between these
various genotypes and specific phenotypes is not immediately
obvious.
To improve our understanding of these diseases we have
studied six of these SCN4A mutations using the recombinant
human skeletal muscle Na+ channel (hSkMl) (18) expressed
heterologously in a mammalian cell line. We find that all of
the PC mutants exhibit similar changes in channel inactivation and that these changes are distinct from those that
characterize the in vitro behavior of the expressed HYPP
mutation. These observations provide solid evidence that the
biophysical behavior of Na+ channel alleles that cause PC
differs from that of HYPP mutations.

ABSTRACT
Mutations in the skeletal muscle voltagegated Na+ channel a-subunit have been found in patients with
two distinct hereditary disorders of sarcolemmal excitation:
hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP) and paramyotonia
congenita (PC). Six of these mutations have been functionally
expressed in a heterologous cell line (tsA201 cells) using the
recombinant human skeletal muscle Na+ channel a-subunit
cDNA hSkMl. PC mutants from diverse locations in this
subunit (T1313M, L1433R, R1448H, R1448C, A1156T) all
exhibit a similar disturbance in channel inactivation characterized by reduced macroscopic rate, accelerated recovery, and
altered voltage dependence. PC mutants had no significant
abnormality in activation. In contrast, one HYPP mutation
studied (T704M) has a normal inactivation rate but exhibits
shifts in the midpoints of steady-state activation and inactivation along the voltage axis. These findings help to explain the
phenotypic differences between HYPP and PC at the molecular
and biophysical level and contribute to our understanding of
Na+ channel structure and function.

Sodium channels are integral membrane proteins that exist in
most excitable cells and are primarily responsible for the
rapid depolarization characterizing the initial phase of an
action potential (1). In skeletal muscle, Na+ channels are
essential for the propagation of action potentials along the
muscle fiber surface and into the t-tubular system, triggering
events that ultimately lead to contraction. Functional disturbances in muscle Na+ channels are associated with unusual disease phenotypes generally categorized as the periodic paralyses and nondystrophic myotonias (2).
Paramyotonia congenita (PC) is a rare, autosomal dominant hereditary disease characterized by painless stiffness
(myotonia) of voluntary muscles that occurs upon exposure
to cold or following strenuous exercise (3). The disorder is
clinically heterogeneous, and some patients exhibit episodic
weakness and other features resembling another rare disorder, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP). The clinical
features of both PC and HYPP can be attributed to abnormal
skeletal muscle membrane excitability, and symptoms can be
correlated with either sarcolemmal hyperexcitability or inexcitability. In HYPP, the dominant clinical presentation is
that of episodic muscle weakness or paralysis. Paralysis in
this setting occurs concomitantly with a failure of the sarcolemma to initiate and conduct action potentials (inexcitability) (4). In contrast, PC patients primarily have symptoms of

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Construction and Expression of hSkMl Mutants. Sitedirected mutagenesis was performed using the Altered Sites
mutagenesis system employing the plasmid vector pSELECT
(Promega) as described (19). For creation of mutants A1156T
and T1313M, an additional pSELECT-hSkMl construct was
made by directionally subcloning a 1564-bp Sac I/HindIll
fragment (nt 2488-4051) of wild-type (WT) hSkMl into the
vector in the antisense orientation, and single-stranded DNA
was rescued using R408 helper phage. For T704M, a 1909-bp
BamHI/Sph I fragment (nt 327-2235) was subcloned into the
vector. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were as follows: A1156T,
5'-GCCCTCCTAGGCACCATCCCCTCCA-3'; T1313M, 5'ACCTCTTTATGATGGAGGAACAGA-3'; L1433R, 5'GATCAGGTCAGAGCGGGCAAGGCCCAC-3'; T704M,
5'-GGGTAACCTGATGCTGGTGCTGGC-3'; R1448H and
R1448C were as described (19). All mutations were verified
by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Following mutagenesis,
full-length mutant hSkMl constructs were assembled in the
mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV, and introduced
into tsA201 cells by transient transfection (calcium phosphate
precipitation method) as described (19). Cells were used for
recording 24-60 hr after transfection.

Electrophysiology. Standard whole cell recordings were
obtained as described (19). We compensated 80% of the
series resistance, which was always <3 Mfl. The series
resistance errors were <4 mV. Patch electrodes contained (in
mM) 35 NaCl, 105 CsF, 10 EGTA, and 10 Cs-Hepes (pH 7.4).
The bath contained 150 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and
10 Na-Hepes (pH 7.4). The data were filtered at 5 kHz and
acquired using the program PCLAMP (Axon Instruments,
Foster City, CA). Solution components were obtained from
Sigma. Temperature was controlled by a Peltier unit using a
TC-10 controller (Dagan Instruments, Minneapolis). Except
where indicated, currents were measured at 21-22°C.
Whole cell data were analyzed by a combination of PCLAMP
programs and SIGMAPLOT (Jandel, San Rafael, CA). Steadystate inactivation curves were fit to the equation I/Imax = 1/{1
+ exp[SiF (V- Vo.5)/RT}, where Imax is the current measured
at the most negative prepulse potential (usually -140 mV),
Vo.5 is the midpoint of the curve, Si is the slope factor, and
RT/F = 25 mV. A Boltzmann curve was also fit to conductance-voltage curves obtained from peak current after a
depolarization. Recovery from inactivation was fit to a single
exponential decay, and the time constants at each recovery
potential were fit to r(V) = r(O) * exp(8rVF/RJ), where Sr is
the slope of the curve and r(0) is the time constant for
recovery at 0 mV. Each experiment was performed on four
to six cells, and the data are presented as mean + SEM. Two
independent clones for each mutant were characterized to
decrease the possibility that the observed effects were due to
inadvertent mutations.

RESULTS
PC Mutations Slow Na+ Channel Inactivation. WT hSkMl
Na+ channels and five PC mutants constructed in the hSkMl
background were expressed transiently in tsA201 cells and
the resulting Na+ currents were examined by patch clamp
electrophysiology in the whole cell configuration. Fig. 1
shows sodium currents obtained by whole cell recording for
these six alleles. The currents from all clones show a typical
pattern of rapid voltage-dependent activation followed by
inactivation. However, all of the PC mutant channel currents

differed from WT in showing variable slowing in channel
inactivation.
Normalized plots of peak current vs. membrane potential
are superimposable for all six clones (Fig. 2A), suggesting
that the voltage dependence of activation is unaffected by PC
mutations. The kinetics of activation are also normal in the
PC mutants. Superimposed scaled plots of the inward current
at -10 mV for each clone show the striking effect of PC
mutations on inactivation with little change in the kinetics of
activation (Fig. 2B). A similarity in activation time course for
WT and PC mutants was obtained at all membrane potentials,
as measured by the half-time from the onset of the depolarization to the time of the peak current (Fig. 2C).
We quantified the slowing of inactivation for PC mutants
by fitting the decay of sodium current, after a depolarizing
voltage step, to a single exponential function with a time
constant, rh. In general, a single exponential provided a good
fit to the data, and the currents decayed to zero during
sufficiently long depolarizations. These time constants are
plotted in Fig. 3A as a function of membrane potential. All PC
mutants had rh values significantly greater than those observed in the WT over the entire voltage range from -40 to
+80 mV.
The voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation for the
five PC mutants is also significantly altered (Fig. 3B). Table
1 shows that this voltage dependence, as indicated by the
slopes obtained from Boltzmann curves fit to the data,
decreases in the following order: WT > T1313M > A1156T
> R1448H > L1433R > R1448C. Furthermore, mutants
R1448H, L1433R, and R1448C exhibit large shifts in the
midpoints of steady-state inactivation, when compared with
the WT (Fig. 3B; Table 1). The midpoints are shifted in the
hyperpolarizing direction for the two mutants in the S4
segment of domain 4 (S4/D4), R1448H and R1448C, and in
the depolarizing direction for the S3/D4 mutant L1433R.
These differences imply that a single mechanism may not
explain the alterations in channel gating characteristics of PC
mutants.
PC Mutations Accelerate Recovery from Inactivation. Despite having slowed inactivation, all of the PC mutants that
we examined had a faster rate of recovery from inactivation

in mammalian cells by other investigators (21, 22). The
currents generated by these HYPP mutations differ substantially from those we describe here for PC mutants. One report
showed a small noninactivating component of macroscopic
sodium current after a depolarization (21), whereas the other
report emphasized a 10- to 15-mV hyperpolarizing shift in the
peak current-voltage relationship (22). Neither study reported significant changes in the time constants for fast
inactivation. In contrast, the PC mutants we studied all have
voltage dependences of activation indistinguishable from WT
and show a pronounced slowing of fast inactivation. However, our data were obtained with the human muscle Na+
channel (hSkMl) rather than the rat muscle channel used in
the above studies. We therefore constructed the HYPP
mutant T704M in hSkMl and examined its properties under
the same conditions as above, to test if PC and HYPP
mutations truly produce distinct functional abnormalities in
hSkMl.
Fig. 4A shows a family of sodium currents from the HYPP
mutant T704M. The peak current-voltage relationship of
these currents is compared with the WT in Fig. 4B. These
data show two properties consistent with the previous studies
using this mutation in rSkMl, a small increase in noninactivating current, especially seen at positive voltages in our
experiments, and a hyperpolarizing shift in the peak currentvoltage relationship (21, 22). When compared with WT,
T704M showed no difference in Th (Fig. 4C) or recovery from
inactivation (data not shown). However, in contrast with the

than the WT channels (Fig. 3C). The voltage dependence of
the recovery rate was also affected in the PC mutants. The
slopes of the regression lines of the semilogarithmic plot of
Fig. 3C (expressed as an equivalent charge; see Materials
and Methods) are a direct measurement of the voltage
dependence of the recovery rate. Table 1 shows that this
voltage dependence has the same relative order among the six
mutants as we observed for steady-state inactivation. The
reduction in voltage dependence is most severe in mutants
R1448H, L1433R, and R1448C. These three mutants are all in
domain 4 and are located near the extracellular surface of the
channel, according to a standard topological interpretation of
the structure of the sodium channel (20). This raises the
possibility that R1448 and L1433 are located within structures
that are important for inactivation.
Temperature Sensitivity of PC Mutations. One of the clinical features of PC is the exacerbation of muscle stiffness by
cold, and many investigators assumed that the corresponding
Na+ channel mutations would prove to be temperature
sensitive (15). We previously found little difference between
the temperature dependence of Th in WT and that observed
in the PC mutants at residue R1448 for temperatures between
14AC and 30°C (19). We obtained similar measurements for
the PC mutant T1313M and again found little difference from
the WT over this temperature range (data not shown).
Biophysical Differences Between PC and HYPP. Two HYPP
mutations, T704M and M1592V, have been constructed in

results of Cummins et al. (22), steady-state inactivation in
T704M was shifted 12.8 mV in the depolarizing direction (Fig.
4D). Thus, it would seem that this mutation produces a more
severe phenotype when expressed in hSkMl than in rSkMl.
The combination of a 9.1-mV hyperpolarizing shift of activation with a depolarizing shift of inactivation (Fig. 4D)
creates a range of voltages (-65 to -30 mV) over which a
steady-state sodium current will flow.

DISCUSSION
Understanding the molecular basis for gating of ion channels
by membrane potential has been the subject of intense
investigation. A unique opportunity now exists to examine
previously unexplored regions of the voltage-gated Na+
channel by using two unusual genetic diseases of muscle, PC
and HYPP, as models for channel dysfunction. In these two
distinct, but related, disorders of muscle membrane excitability, mutations in the gene encoding the skeletal muscle
Na+ channel a-subunit disturb gating of the channel in unique
ways.
In our experiments using the human muscle Na+ channel
hSkMl, the HYPP mutant T704M shifts the midpoints of
steady-state activation and inactivation along the voltage axis
without affecting the rate or voltage dependence of either
process. These functional abnormalities can lead to persistent Na+ current at voltages where the activation and inactivation curves overlap (Fig. 4D). The occurrence of this
"window current" will tend to cause depolarization of skel-

A

etal muscle cells in HYPP patients. In contrast, Na+ channel
mutations found in PC exhibit normal activation kinetics but
share three characteristic disturbances in inactivation: (i)
reduced rate and voltage dependence of inactivation, (ii)
altered voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation, and
(iii) increased rate and decreased voltage dependence of
recovery from inactivation.
Alterations in either the kinetic or the steady-state properties of inactivation may have significant effects on muscle
excitability. The kinetic effects seen with PC mutations, a
decreased rate of inactivation and an increased rate of
recovery from inactivation, would increase excitability during and following action potentials. By contrast, the steadystate properties of inactivation will determine the number of
Na+ channels available to open during a depolarization. It is
in this regard that the PC mutants differ dramatically among
one another. Our data show hyperpolarizing shifts in steadystate inactivation for mutations of R1448 but depolarizing
shifts for all other mutants, especially L1433R (Fig. 3B; Table
1). However, individuals with either the R1448 or the L1433
mutation have a similar PC phenotype (12, 13). Thus, the final
clinical expression of these mutations seems unrelated to the
direction and magnitude of the shifts they produce in steadystate inactivation. Since all of the PC mutations studied
produce similar abnormalities in the kinetics of inactivation,
the kinetic effects are likely to be the most important in
determining phenotype.
The hyperpolarizing shifts in steady-state inactivation for
R1448 mutants cannot be explained by a slow inactivation of
the channel during the 500-ms prepulse we used for measuring steady-state inactivation, because similar experiments
with R1448C using 25-ms prepulses produced data with the
same midpoint as we observed in Fig. 3B (data not shown).
A possible explanation for this is that the rate of entry into an
inactivated state is faster for these mutants than WT at
potentials more negative than -60 mV. This is the expected
result of the extrapolation of Th vs. voltage curves (Fig. 3A)
to voltages more negative than -40 mV. For example, the Th
of R1448C is almost completely voltage independent below 0
mV (see figure 2B in ref. 19), whereas Th for WT increases
strongly with hyperpolarization (Fig. 3A). Therefore, even
though R1448C channels recover faster from inactivation
than WT channels at voltages more hyperpolarized than -80

mV (Fig. 4C), the entry into inactivated states will be much
more frequent for R1448C than WT and hence a greater
degree of steady-state inactivation at these voltages.
The PC mutations that we studied all affect channel inactivation. We speculate that they either alter the structure of
the inactivation gate or its receptor or modify the kinetics of
inactivation by affecting conformational transitions elsewhere in the channel protein. The inactivation gate has been
postulated to be the cytoplasmic linker between D3 and D4
(23, 24). One of the PC mutants, T1313M, is in this linker and
its neighboring residues (isoleucine, phenylalanine, methionine) are known to play a critical role in fast inactivation (25).
Ofthe other four PC mutations, one, A1156T, is located in the
cytoplasmic loop between S4 and S5 in D3. The corresponding segment in voltage-gated potassium channels is believed
to be part of the receptor for the inactivation gate (26). The
remaining three mutations are located at a distance from
either the inactivation gate or its putative receptor in current
models of Na+ channel structure (L1433R, D4/S3; R1448H
and R1448C, D4/S4). One possibility that would account for
the similar phenotype of these mutants is that, through
allosteric effects, they indirectly modify the conformation of
the gate or its receptor. Another hypothesis is that these
mutants affect a part of the molecule that must undergo a
critical conformation change during the steps leading to
gate-receptor interaction. Such mutations might have a profound effect on the macroscopic rates of channel inactivation
without directly affecting the binding affilnity of the gate for
its receptor site on the cytoplasmic surface of the protein.
Finally, since the Na+ channel 181 subunit is known to have
significant effects on hSkMl inactivation (27), mutations that

disrupt the association of a and 81 subunits could produce
slowed inactivation similar to that observed for PC mutants.
We feel this is not a likely explanation for our data since
absence of,1 subunit would result in slowed recovery from
inactivation as well (28), not accelerated recovery as observed with PC mutations. However, mutations that affect
the interaction of a and P1 subunits in a more specific fashion
might produce phenotypes similar to those seen for the PC
mutants described here.
