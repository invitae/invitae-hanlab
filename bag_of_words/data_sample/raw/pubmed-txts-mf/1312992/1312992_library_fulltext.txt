Summary. Details are given concerning the phenylketonuria (PKU) mutations R408Q and F299C. Both mutations were identified among 47 PKU patients, derived
from the Norwegian PKU registry. A novel PKU mutation (R408Q) was identified, by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, on six out of eight mutant
haplotype 12 chromosomes and on none of the other
PKU chromosomes. The F299C mutation occurred exclusively on mutant haplotype 8, and was the only mutation associated with this haplotype (on six chromosomes).
One patient homozygous for each mutation was found.
The patient homozygous for F299C manifested severe
PKU, whereas the R408Q homozygote exhibited a mild
PKU variant. Pedigree analysis of these families has not,
so far, revealed consanguinity. Information on the place
of birth of the relevant grandparents of the PKU patients
with these mutations suggests that each of these mutations in Norway has originated from a common gene
source.

Introduction
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by the loss or severe
reduction of the enzymatic activity of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxytase (PAH). The observed
clinical heterogeneity among PKU patients is thought to
be a reflection of genetic heterogeneity at the molecular
level (Gfittler et al. 1987; Rey et al. 1988). It is possible
to recognize more than 50 different restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotypes at the PAH
locus (Woo 1988). Several deleterious mutations in the
P A H gene have been shown to be strongly associated
with individual haplotypes. In Caucasians, these include
the mutations in haplotype 1 (R261Q: Abadie et al.
1989; R408W: John et al. 1990; P281L: Dworniczak et
al. 1991), haplotype 2 (R408W: DiLella et al. 1987),

haplotype 3 (IVS-12: DiLella et al. 1986), haplotype 4
(R158Q: Okano et al. 1990a), and haplotype 7 (G272X:
Apold et al. 1990). In addition to these haplotype-specific associations, some mutations occur on more than one
haptotype as a result of recurrent mutation, gene conversion or cross-over events (e.g., mutation R408W: John
et al. 1990; Okano et al. 1990b).
We have previously described a PKU mutation that is
associated with haplotype 7, and that occurs particularly
frequently among Norwegian PKU patients (G272X:
Apold et al. 1990). Moreover, mutant haplotype 12 occurs more frequently among Norwegian PKU chromosomes (comprising 8% of all mutant genes; Apold et al.
1990) than among Norwegian non-PKU chromosomes
(2% of all; Apold et al. 1990), or other European PKU
chromosomes (an average of 2% ; Daiger et al. 1989).
No PKU mutation has so far been reported in association with haplotype 12 alleles. We therefore launched a
directed search for haplotype 12 mutations. We first constructed tests based on the potymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and restriction enzyme cleavage for all the ethnically relevant, previously published mutations (Eiken
et al. 1991). After having excluded the previously known
mutations from the mutant haplotype 12 chromosomes,
we continued the mutation search with single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analyses. This search,
followed by direct sequencing of PCR products, led to
the characterization of a novel mutation in exon 12 of
the P A H gene.
The mutant haplotype 8 also occurs relatively frequently in Norwegian PKU patients (comprising 6% of
mutant genes), whereas it is rare among other European
PKU patients (Apold et al. 1990). Normal haplotype 8
genes have not been observed in any European population. We have found that all mutant haplotype 8 chromosomes carried the F299C mutation. Although this
mutation has been briefly described (Okano et al. 1989),
its haplotype association and phenotypic data have not
previously been reported.

Materials and methods

were digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme for 4 h, and
analyzed in 3% NuSieve agarose (FMC, Rockland, USA).

PKU families
Forty-seven Norwegian PKU patients (age 1-19 years) and their
parents were investigated. All patients studied had been given the
PKU diagnosis on the basis of having pretreatment serum phenylalanine levels above 600 gmol/1; dietary treatment had then been
initiated. The patients and their PAH RFLP haplotypes have been
described previously (Apold et al. 1990). The maximum pretreatment
serum phenylalanine value was chosen as a parameter of the severity
of the disease (Grittier et al. 1987), and was the highest neonatal
phenylalaninevalue measured before dietary restriction was initiated
(for 5 cases this value was noted after the first month of age).

S S C P analysis
SSCPs were detected by the method described by Orita et al.
(1989a, b). All exons of the PAH gene from patients with mutant
haplotype 12 were amplified by PCR and analyzed for SSCPs.
Exon 12 and its flanking regions were amplified in a 245-bp DNA
fragment (with PCR primers 12A and 12B; DiLella et al. 1988).
The PCR reaction mixture (100 gl) contained 10ram TRIS-HC1
pH 8.3, 50 mM KC1, 1.5 mM MgCI2, 0.01% (w/v) gelatin, 0.12 mM
of each dNTP, 0.6 ~tM of each primer, 0.1 gl (32p)dCTP (3000 Ci/
mmol), 0.1 gg genomic DNA, and 1 unit Taq polymerase (Perkin
Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, USA). PCR was performed, in a Thermal
Cycler (Perkin Elmer Cetus), for 30 cycles consisting of DNA denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and primer
extension at 72°C for 60 s, :followed by an incubation at 72°C for
7 rain. A 1-gl sample of the PCR reaction was diluted with 9 gl
95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromophenol blue, and
0.05% xylene cyanol. The samples were heated to 95°C for 2 min,
and 2 gl of the heated samples were loaded into each well on a
neutral 5% acrylamide-TBE (89mM TRIS-HC1, 89mM boric
acid, 2 mM EDTA) gel with dimensions 35 cm × 45 cm x 0.4 mm.
Electrophoresis was performed at 50 W in a cold-room for about
3 h. The gel was then transferred to moist Whatman 3 MM filter
paper, wrapped in Saran film, and finally autoradiographed with
an intensifyingscreen at -80°C for 12-24 h.

DNA sequencing of PCR products of P A H exon 12
Direct DNA sequencing of asymmetric PCR products was performed as recently described (Apold et al. 1990).

Results
Identification o f a novel mutation in exon 12
o f the P A H gene

The Norwegian haplotype 12 chromosomes did not host
any of the hitherto published mutations occurring in
Caucasian populations. SSCP screening analyses were
therefore applied in an attempt to identify new mutations. We found gel shifts in exon 12 of genomic D N A
from PKU patients with at least one mutant haplotype 12
allele (Fig. 1). Six out of eight mutant chromosomes contained an aberrantly migrating fragment. Direct genomic
sequencing of DNA from a patient homozygous for haplotype 12, and for the gel shift, revealed a transition of a
G to an A in position 1445 of the gene (Fig. 2). A sub-

6) and a normal control (lane 7) have the normal pattern

Restriction-enzyme-based mutation assays
A set of assays for 18 PKU mutations was developed on the basis
of the present findings and published data (Eiken et al. 1991).
These assays are based on PCR amplification combined with enzymatic cleavage of naturally occurring or amplification-created
restriction sites (ACRS).
DNA sequence data indicated that the novel R408Q mutation
disrupted a naturally occurring HaeIII recognition site. The F299C
mutation could be detected by an ACRS assay using the restriction
enzyme HindIII. Exons 12 and 8 were amplified from all 47 index
cases. The reaction mixture (100 gl) contained 0.1-0.5 t~g genomic
DNA, 10mM TRIS-HC1 pH 8.3, 50raM KCI, 1.5mM MgC12,
0.01% (w/v) gelatin, 0.12ram of each dNTP, 0.6gM of each
primer and 2.5 units Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer Cetus). A
total of 30 cycles were carried out at 94°C for 30s, 55°C for 30s,
and 72°C for lmin, followed by incubation at 72°C for 7min
(Thermal Cycler, Perkin Elmer Cetus). The exon 12 primers were
the same as those used for the SSCP analysis. The primers used in
ACRS were a modified 8A299HindIII primer (5'-CCTTGTTTCAGATCGAAGCTT-3') and the exon 8B primer (S.L.C. Woo,
personal communication). Samples of 15 gl of the PCR reactions

Further haplotype associations and Mendelian transmission
of the mutations F299C and R408Q
We then tested all 47 index cases for the presence of
both mutations. The F299C mutation was found on all
the six haplotype 8 chromosomes, and on two chromosomes whose haplotype could not be assigned (the F299C
mutation comprising 8.5% of all mutant genes). T h e result was confirmed by SSCP analysis of exon 8 combined
with D N A sequencing (results not shown). The R408Q
mutation occurred on six out of eight mutant haplotype
12 chromosomes (6.4% of all mutant genes), and only
on this haplotype background. The genotypes and haplotypes are shown in Table 1.
The Mendelian transmission of the mutations in P K U
families is shown in Fig. 3 and 4.

value (823 ~tmol/1), and her clinical course was essentially
normal with no dietary treatment beyond the first year
of life. The patient who is homozygous for the F299C
mutation (ID no. 27) had a high pretreatment phenylalanine value (2300 gmol/1), but a normal psychomotor
development on a strict dietary regime. However, two
older sibs of the latter index case, born before the screening program was established, exhibited severe mental retardation.
Geographic distribution o f the R408Q
and the F299C mutations

The district of origin of the two mutations can be ascertained from the birthplaces of the relevant grandparents,
one of whom must have passed on the mutation (see Fig.
5). In contrast to both the overall distribution of PKU
mutations and the general population density in Norway, the ancestries of the F299C and R408Q mutations
appear restricted to the western and northern coastal
districts.

Discussion

We have, by using the SSCP technique, been able to
identify a novel mutation in codon 408 in the P A H gene.
Furthermore, we report the haplotype associated with
the F299C mutation mentioned by Okano et al. (1989).
High incidences of both the novel R408Q mutation (6.4%)
and the F299C mutation (8.5%) have been observed in
Norway. On the basis of the observed haplotype associations for both mutations, we suggest that the frequencies
of these mutations in other Caucasian populations are
low, with an overall frequency of haplotype 8 in European populations of 1.5% and of haplotype 12 of 2.1%
(Daiger et al. 1989).
The ancestries of both the F299C and the R408Q mutation can be traced back to sparsely populated coastal
districts of northern and north-western Norway. There is
no known consanguinity or interrelationship among these
families, but the striking geographic distribution nevertheless suggests a founder effect for each of these mutations several generations back. The data support the
hypothesis that the major mechanism for the spread of
phenylketonuria in Europe is based on multiple founders (Woo et al., in preparation).
The novel R408Q mutation is relatively benign, as assessed from the low pretreatment serum phenylalanine
values and the clinical picture of the disease, both in the
essentially untreated patient homozygous for the R408Q
mutation, and in all compound heterozygotes with this
mutation, The range of the pretreatment serum phenylalanine values in the four compound heterozygotes is
881-1230 gmol/1, whereas the value for the R408Q homozygote is 823 gmol/1 (Table 1). These are typical values for non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia.

612
The p r e t r e a t m e n t serum phenylalanine values in 4
P K U patients who are compound heterozygotes for the
F299C mutation in combination with other mutations
thought to be highly deleterious (G272X, R158Q, R408W,
and R243X) ranged from 2212gmol/1 to 4631 ~tmol/1.
These data, in addition to the p r e t r e a t m e n t value of 2300
gmol/1 for the patient homozygous for the F299C mutation, indicate that this is a severe mutation. Two informative secondary cases (sibs of the patient who is homozygous F299C~299C; Fig. 4) received no treatment, and
developed severe mental retardation, which would suggest a residual P A H enzyme activity of less than 1% of
normal values (Scriver et al. 1988). In contrast, in one
patient who is compound heterozygous for the F299C/
Y414C genotype, the pretreatment phenylalanine value
was 1026 gmol/1. This suggests that the latter mutation is
mild, an observation that is in agreement with that of
O k a n o et al. (1991).
Our data show some consistency between the R408Q
and the F299C mutations and their respective resulting
clinical expression. These findings indicate that lesions
in the P A H gene are the major determining factors with
respect to the resulting P K U phenotype. However, recent enzymatic studies suggest that other mechanisms
m a y influence P A H activity ( T h o m p s o n and Halliday
1990), indicating that additional genetic determinants
are at work. This is s u p p o r t e d by a report of widely different clinical phenotypes in patients with presumably
identical P A H genotypes (DiSilvestre et al. 1991). Further studies are needed to show the extent to which the
determination of P K U genotype may improve the prediction of the clinical course of the disease and may better define the necessity of dietary treatment of patients.
