Abstract
Two mutations of the porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase gene
resulting in cross-reacting immunological material (CRIM)
positive forms of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) have been
identified by in vitro amplification of cDNA and cloning of the
amplified products in a bacterial expression vector. Both mutations resulted from G to A transitions in exon 10 of the gene
and produced arginine to glutamine substitutions in the abnormal protein. Expression of mutant cDNA in Escherichia coli
reveals that one but not the other of these amino acid changes
results in a striking decrease of the optimal pH of the mutated
enzyme. One or the other of these two mutations accounted for
the defect causing AIP in six unrelated patients among the
eight patients evaluated with the CRIM positive subtype of
this disorder. (J. Clin. Invest. 1990. 86:1511-1516.) Key

Introduction
Porphobilinogen (PBG)' deaminase (hydroxymethylbilane
synthase, EC 4.3.1.8.) is the third enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, and catalyzes the polymerization of four molecules of PBG to give the linear tetrapyrrole hydroxymethylbilane (1). A partial deficiency of this enzyme is responsible for
acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). This disease, inherited in
an autosomal dominant fashion, is characterized by acute attacks of neurological dysfunction with abdominal pain, hypertension, tachycardia, and peripheral neuropathy (1). The clinical manifestations are accompanied by the abnormal excretion of products derived from the heme pathway, mostly
5-aminolevulinic acid and PBG. Most individuals with PBG
deaminase deficiency trait remain asymptomatic, but acute
attacks of the disease are often precipitated by additional factors such as drugs, alcohol, and caloric deprivation.
Early detection of gene carriers is important in the prevention of acute attacks, as they can be advised to avoid precipitating factors (1). Because asymptomatic carriers do not consisReceivedfor publication 13 April 1990 and in revisedform 9 July 1990.

tently excrete excess amounts of heme precursors, the usual
screening method in AIP families is based on the determination of PBG deaminase activity in erythrocytes. Erythrocyte
PBG deaminase levels, however, are affected by additional
factors such as erythrocyte age and the presence of other diseases, resulting in some overlap between values for normal
individuals and AIP patients (1, 2). These limitations
prompted us to undertake the study of the mutations responsible for AIP at the DNA level.
The molecular heterogeneity of the mutations producing
AIP is indicated by the existence of several phenotypic subtypes at the protein level (3, 4). In the more common forms of
AIP, in which a PBG deaminase deficiency involves all cell
types, different investigators documented the existence of two
subgroups of patients based on the measurement of crossreacting immunological material (CRIM) in erythrocytes, referred to as CRIM negative and CRIM positive mutations (1,
3, 4). Moreover, DNA studies of the PBG deaminase locus
have demonstrated that AIP mutations are associated with
different restriction haplotypes (5, 6). We have previously
identified two different mutations accounting for another subgroup of AIP families in which the expression of the enzymatic
defect is restricted to nonerythropoietic cells (7, 8). Recent
work in our laboratory has revealed the molecular abnormality
responsible for acute intermittent porphyria in a patient with
excess CRIM in lymphoblastoid cells (9), a point mutation in
exon 12 of the PBG deaminase gene which results in defective
splicing and leads to the formation of a shortened mRNA.
Here we report the identification of two additional point
mutations resulting in the synthesis of mutant PBG deaminase
proteins in which arginine residues are replaced by glutamine
residues at positions 167 or 173 of the protein. The consequences of these mutations on enzymatic function has been
evaluated through expression of the mutant cDNA in Escherichia co/i.

Methods
Patients. Eight patients with CRIM positive and 20 patients with
CRIM negative forms of AlP were studied. The diagnosis was established on the basis of the clinical symptoms of the disease accompanied
by increased urinary excretion of PBG and aminolevulinic acid and
normal fecal porphyrin excretion. Diminished activity of PBG deaminase was also observed in erythrocytes of these patients.
CRIM determination. The CRIM phenotype was determined in
either lymphoblastoid cells or erythrocytes from one or two members
of seven families with AIP and one normal control as previously described (4, 9).
RNA and DNA isolation. Total cellular RNA was prepared from
lymphoblastoid cells, DNA was isolated from either lymphoblastoid
cells or peripheral white cells as previously described (9).
Amplification of cDNA. One microgram of total cellular RNA was

reverse transcribed. The resulting cDNA was amplified in vitro as
previously reported (9) except that the primers were modified to introduce a Nco I restriction site in the 5' primer and a Hind III site in the 3'
primer. The 5' primer differed from the sequence in exon 1 by a T to C
change after the initiating ATG, the 3' primer corresponded to a 3'
untranslated region in exon 15 and contained at its 5' extremity a 7
bases addition including a Hind III site. The sequences ofthese primers
are as follows:
5' primer: 5'GAGCCATGGCTGGTAACGGCAATGC 3'
3' primer: 5'CCCAAGCTTCTGTGCCCCACAAACCA 3'.
Cloning and sequencing of the amplified cDNAs. The amplified
cDNAs were phenol extracted, ethanol precipitated, digested with Nco
I and Hind III and purified through spun-down chromatography using
sephacryl S200 (Industries Biologiques Franpaises, Clichy, France).
The purified fragments were ligated into the corresponding sites of the
plasmid expression vector PKK 233 (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals,
Uppsala, Sweden) and subcloned in E. coli DH5. Cloned DNA was
sequenced using a Sequenase sequencing kit (United States Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Two of the sequencing primers hybridized to the vector, one
on each side of the insertion site (PKKI and PKK2) and four primers
hybridized to either the coding (PHEl and PHE6) or the noncoding
strands of the cDNA (PHEO0 and PHE15). The sequence of the different primers is given below:

cDNA. The PCR-amplified products from seven AIP patients with
CRIM positive mutations (lanes 1-7) and from a normal control
were studied by either restriction analysis or hybridization with
ASOs. (A) Restriction map of the amplified cDNA. The arrow indicates the position of the Msp I restriction site suppressed by the mutation at position 518. The numbers indicate the size of the expected
fragments. (B) Agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products after
cleavage with Msp I and ethidium bromide staining. The G to A
transition at position 518 supresses a Msp I site. The digestion of a
normal amplified cDNA yields two fragments of 513 and 520 bp that
migrate at the same position and a fragment of 84 bp (not seen on
the gel). In lanes 5 and 6, the presence of an additional 597-bp fragment reflects the absence of the Msp I site abolished by the mutation. (C) Dot-blot analysis of amplified cDNA using ASOs for the G

and from a normal control were hybridized in duplicate with probes
corresponding to the normal sequence (N) and to the mutated seof amplified sample
quence (M). For hybridization analysis, 10
were processed as previously described (9). Zetaprobe nylon filters
were prehybridized in 5X SSEP, SX Denhardt's solution (lX SSEP

same temperature for 12 h with 106 cpm/ml of radiolabeled oligonucleotide. The probe was labeled at the 5' end with r 32-P ATP to a
specific activity of 1 X I09 cpm/Mug. Blots were washed at room temperature in 2X SSEP for 30 min then at 53°C for 4 min and autoradiographed at -70°C with one lightning-plus intensifying screen

Amplification of genomic DNA. DNA amplifications were carried
out according to Saiki et al. (10) in the presence of Taq polymerase
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The two primers used were designed to
match a genomic sequence in intron 9 of the gene (CCGACACTGTGGTCCTTAGCAA) for the sense primer and in exon 11 (AGCATACATGCATTTCTCA) for the antisense primer, allowing the amplification of a 720-bp segment containing the site of the mutation.
The samples were incubated sequentially at 940C for 1 min, 50'C for 1
min, and 720C for 1.5 min for 30 cycles.
Separation of human PBG deaminase from E. coli. Bacteria were
grown for 24 h in 2 liters of LB medium, harvested by centrifugation at
4°C for 10 min at 1,500 g, and washed 3 times with Tris-HCl buffer ( 10
mmol/l, pH 8.0). The cells were resuspended in the same buffer and
disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation for 30 min at 12,000 g,
the supernatant was filtered (0.22 gim) and loaded onto a Mono Q
ion-exchange column (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals). The human PBG
deaminase was separated from the E. coli enzyme using a FPLC system
by elution in a NaCI gradient under conditions described by de Rooij et
al. (11). The presence of human PBG deaminase was detected by
ELISA using specific antibodies against human PBG deaminase (4).
PBG deaminase assay. To determine the PH optimum of the normal and mutated PBG deaminase expressed in E. coli, enzymatic
activity was measured at different pH in phosphate buffer. PH was
controlled by mixing various volumes of 50 mmol/l Na2HPO4 and 50
mmol/l H3PO4 both containing 20 mmol/l Histidine, 0.02% NaN3 and
1.2 g/liter BSA. Each reaction mixture contained 50 ,l of sample and
500 gl phosphate buffer. The reaction was started by the addition of 50
gl PBG in H20 (2.4 mmol/liter) and stopped by adding 600 gl TCA
(1.5 mmol/liter). The quantification of uroporphyrinogen formed was
performed as previously described (1 1).

functional consequences of these mutations, we decided to
clone cDNAs from patients in a procaryotic expression vector.
To do so, we isolated mRNA from lymphoblastoid cells, produced cDNA by reverse transcription, and amplified a fragment containing the complete coding region. Three patients
with CRIM positive mutations were studied and several independent clones that failed to express human PBG deaminase
activity were sequenced from each patient. Two clones from
one patient and four clones from a different patient contained
a base change G to A at position 500 of the cDNA from the
translation initiation codon (12). Three clones studied from a
third patient exhibited a G to A transition at position 518.
These two mutations are located on exon 10 of the gene

(Fig. 1).

From a total of nine clones that we sequenced, four additional base changes were found but not confirmed by sequencing other clones from the same patient. These "sporadic" changes were therefore attributed to errors introduced
by the Taq Polymerase during the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), a rate of misincorporation consistent with previous
reports ( 13).
The G to A transitions at positions 500 and 518 were confirmed by direct study of the PCR products, and identical
mutations were sought in other patients with the same phenotype. This was done using restriction analysis for the 518 mutation, which results in the suppression of a Msp I restriction
site (Fig. 2 B), and by hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASO) for the 500 mutation (Fig. 2 C). Four additional unrelated patients were studied in this way.
To facilitate the screening of these mutations using DNA as
starting material, we identified primers that can be used to
amplify a genomic fragment of 720 bp containing exon 10 of
the gene. The PCR products were probed with two pairs of
ASO, each used to detect a specific mutation. Within each set
of ASO, one oligonucleotide corresponded to the normal sequence and the other to the mutated sequence. The orientation of the oligonucleotide was chosen to obtain maximal de-

to exon 11 of the PBG deaminase gene were obtained from genomic DNA of the same AIP patients and normal control as in Fig. 2. The amplified products were dotted onto a Zeta-probe
membrane in quadruplicate then hybridized to
four probes: 500N, 500M, 51 8N, 51 8M corresponding respectively to 1 7-mer oligonucleotides
matching either the normal (N) or the mutated
(M) sequence centered on the mutated bases. The
sequences of the probes are as follows:

500N: 5'GGTTT-CCCCGCTGTGGA 3'
(noncoding strand)

(coding strand)

of Fig. 2.

normal proteins encoded by cDNAs bearing either of the mutations displayed some residual activity that was readily detectable after separation from the bacterial enzyme using mono Q
ion-exchange chromatography. Their specific activities were
estimated to be 0.7 and 0.6% of the normal human PBG
deaminase specific activity for mutations 500 and 518, respectively, when measured at pH 8. However, the optimal pH of
the abnormal protein corresponding to mutation 500 was dramatically decreased as compared to either the normal enzyme
or the other mutant (Table II). This finding was in agreement
with the data obtained evaluating the mutated enzyme isolated
from erythrocytes of one such patient (F. de Rooj, K. Hamer,
A. Edixhoven, and J. Wilson, manuscript in preparation).

stabilization of imperfectly matched duplexes (14). The results
of these studies confirmed the data obtained evaluating the
cDNA fragments (Fig. 3). Screening of 20 additional patients
with the CRIM negative phenotype yielded negative results in
all cases, but one more patient with the CRIM positive phenotype was identified who had the G to A mutation at position
500 (not shown). Therefore, from a total of eight unrelated
patients with the CRIM positive phenotype, four had the 500
mutation, two had the 518 mutation while two others had
neither of these mutations.
The two mutations reported here result in an arginine to
glutamine substitution in the protein. Both mutated proteins
reacted with antibodies directed against human PBG deaminase and had a migration in SDS polyacrylamide gels similar
to that of the normal enzyme as demonstrated by Western
blots (Fig. 4). The availability of the mutant proteins overexpressed in E. coli allowed us to study some of the consequences
of the amino acid substitutions on protein function. The ab-

Rabbit-specific antibodies against the human enzyme were used to screen fractions for the presence of mutant PBG deaminase.

acterize two new mutations leading to the synthesis of catalytically defective but immunochemically reactive enzyme. These
two mutations are located in close proximity to each other on
exon 10 of the PBG deaminase gene. In both cases, G to A
transitions were found within CG dinucleotides. Such mutations are thought to arise from the oxidative deamination of
methylated cytosines and have previously been detected with a
high frequency in several genetic diseases (15, 16).
The strategy that we have followed here to determine AIP
mutations has several features that should be discussed. First,
starting with mRNA allows to amplification in vitro of the
entire coding sequence in a single step of PCR, but some of the
possible mutations may not be detected in this way, since the
success of this approach requires that the mutant gene is transcribed and that the resulting abnormal mRNA is present in
the cells. For this reason, we have chosen first to investigate
patients with CRIM positive mutations, since the presence of
an abnormal protein in these cases is an indication of the
presence of the mutated mRNA. It is likely, however, that
many CRIM negative mutations can also be detected using
mRNA, including most splicing mutations and amino acid
substitutions that result in protein instability.
Second, although several techniques have been described
for direct sequencing of PCR products, we found cloning the
amplified fragments before sequencing to be more reliable.
Since patients with AIP are heterozygous for the mutation, the
use of an expression vector allowed an easy distinction between clones derived from the mutant and normal mRNA,
based on the determination of the enzymatic activity present
in E. coli cultures. The major drawback to this approach is the
isolation of clones containing base changes resulting from
errors of the Taq polymerase. This problem can be easily circumvented by confirming the presence of the mutation in
several independent clones.
Finally, the expression in E. coli facilitates the isolation of
mutated proteins from overexpressing strains. This allows further characterization of the effect of the mutations on the enzymatic function.
The two mutations that we have described here result in
the presence of glutamine residues instead of arginines in the
abnormal proteins. Functional studies of the two mutant pro-

teins have demonstrated some residual activity in both cases
and a marked decrease in the optimal pH in one of them. It is
of interest to note that the two arginines are highly conserved
amino acids since they are present in PBG deaminase from
many species for which sequence data are available including
rat, mouse, E. coli, and Euglena gracilis (17, 18, 19, 20). A
recent report indicates that modification of one of two conserved lysine residues (Lys-55 and Lys-59) of the PBG deaminase from E. coli results in inactivation of the protein (21).
Other perfectly conserved arrangements of two basic amino
acid residues separated by three to five residues occur at several
sites in this protein. This raises an interesting possibility that
these pairs of positively charged amino acids are part of the
active site and that each ofthem interacts through ionic bonds
with the negatively charged acetic and propionic side chains of
the pyrroles participating in the synthesis of hydroxymethylbilane (20).
Previous work indicated that AIP is a heterogenous disease
at the molecular level and that point mutations rather than
large deletions are likely to account for most of the cases (5).
Five different mutations including the two mutations reported
here have been already identified (7, 8, 9). These results have
practical implications for genetic counseling since gene carriers could be detected by DNA analysis. The efficiency of this
approach will ultimately depend on the extent of the heterogeneity of these mutations. In this respect, it is interesting to note
that one or the other of the two arginine mutations were detected in six of eight of unrelated AIP patients with CRIM
positive forms of the disease. Such phenotype may represent
from 15 to 50% of AIP families according to various reports (3,
4). However, it is likely that both the proportion of patients
with CRIM positive mutations and the frequency of the different mutations among these patients will differ between different ethnic groups. The patients that we have investigated
here were all Caucasians from either France or Holland. Further work is clearly required to define the molecular epidemiology of these mutations in various countries.
