ABSTRACT
Mutations in the genes encoding two proteins of the retinal rod phototransduction cascade, opsin and
the j3 subunit of rod cGMP phosphodiesterase, cause retinitis
pigmentosa (RP) in some families. Here we report defects in
a third member of this biochemical pathway in still other
patients with this disease. We screened 94 unrelated patients
with autosomal dominant RP and 173 unrelated patients with
autosomal recessive RP for mutations in the gene encoding the
a subunit of the rod cGMP-gated cation channel. Five mutant
sequences cosegregated with disease among four unrelated
families with autosomal recessive RP. Two of these were
nonsense mutations early in the reading frame (Glu76End and
Lysl39End) and one was a deletion encompassing most if not
all of the transcriptional unit; these three alleles would not be
expected to encode a functional channel. The remaining two
mutations were a missense mutation (Ser316Phe) and a
frameshift [Arg654(1-bp del)] mutation truncating the last 32
aa in the C terminus. The latter two mutations were expressed
in vitro and found to encode proteins that were predominantly
retained inside the cell instead of being targeted to the plasma
membrane. We conclude that the absence or paucity of
functional cGMP-gated cation channels in the plasma membrane is deleterious to rod photoreceptors and is an uncommon cause of RP.

The genomic structure and sequence of the 10 exons encoding
the a subunit have been determined (12, 13), allowing one to
screen this sequence for defects in patients. This a subunit can
also be expressed in vitro and its channel activity can be
quantified (9, 13).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ascertainment of Patients. Patients were categorized by the
inheritance pattern of the disease as described (14). A set of
96 unrelated individuals without known photoreceptor degeneration were recruited as normal controls. After informed
consent, blood samples were collected from each patient and
normal control, and leukocyte DNA was purified.
Screening for Mutations. The single-strand conformation
polymorphism technique was used to screen for point mutations or other small-scale sequence changes (15). The PCR was
carried out in 96-well microtiter plates with the following sets
of primers (sense/antisense): exon 3, TTCTCCTCAGATATGAAACT/TAAATTAAAGAACITGTAGCT; exon 4, CTG-

CAGTGGTTGAAAACATT/GCACCAAGGGATGGATCATA; exon 5, TATTGTGATTTCACTGCATG/GATTCAGATATATTCCTACA; exons 6 and 7, AAATAAGAGTGGAAGACTGT/GGAAAATCATCCCTGCATCT7; exon 8,
TTCTTGTATCTTGGTAACTA/TGAACTTGGAAACTAGAAAT; exon 9, TTTATTTATACAAGTGTTTC/AAATATTCAAAACTGAACAT; exon 10a, AAGGAGAAA-

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a genetically heterogeneous set of
diseases in which affected individuals develop progressive
degeneration of the rod and cone photoreceptors. Patients
typically experience night blindness by age 20 followed by
progressive loss of peripheral visual field and later central
visual field that leads to blindness usually in middle age. Oral
vitamin A supplementation slows the course of the disease in
most cases (1). Dominant, recessive, X chromosome-linked,
and digenic patterns of inheritance are exemplified by families
with RP, and even among the families with the same inheritance pattern, there is nonallelic heterogeneity. More than 15
genes have been implicated by linkage studies, five of which
have been identified to date. Two of these genes encode
proteins known to function in the phototransduction pathway
[namely, rhodopsin (2) and the ,3 subunit of rod cGMPphosphodiesterase (3)], two are photoreceptor-specific proteins of unknown function [peripherin/RDS (4-6) and ROM1
(6)], and one is an unconventional myosin (7).
Here we report the analysis of the gene encoding the a
subunit of the rod cGMP-gated cation channel, which is the
protein involved in the last stage of the phototransduction
pathway (for review, see ref. 8). The rod cGMP-gated cation
channel is a heterooligomer composed of two homologous
subunits (a and (3), each with cytoplasmic N and C termini, six
putative transmembrane domains, and a pore region (9-11).

exon 10e, CAGTAGACCTCCITGCAAACC/CATGTCCCTGTTAATGACCA. Variant bands were evaluated by direct
genomic sequencing of the corresponding PCR-amplified
DNA segments (16). Sequence variations expected to affect
protein sequence or expression were evaluated by the singlestrand conformation polymorphism technique for cosegregation with the disease in the relatives of the respective
probands.
In selected cases, Southern blot analysis was used to screen
for gene deletions or rearrangements with radiolabeled cDNA
fragments (probe pCNCG) derived from the human a subunit
of the cGMP-gated channel gene (13).
Expression of the Ser316Phe and Arg654(1-bp del) Alleles
in Vitro. The cDNA encoding the a subunit of the human
cGMP-gated cation channel was inserted into the polylinker
site of pCIS (17). In vitro mutagenesis of the wild-type channel
cDNA to produce the Ser316Phe and Arg654(1-bp del) mutations identified in patients was carried out with standard
procedures with single-stranded DNA and oligonucleotides.

For expression of the proteins, cultured human embryonic
kidney cells (HEK-293) were transfected with a mixture of
expression plasmid (10 ,ug), carrier DNA (pBluescript, 10 ,ug),
and simian virus 40 tumor antigen expression plasmid (RSVTAg, 1 ,g) by the calcium phosphate method (18).
Electrical Recordings. At 48-72 hr after transfection, patchclamp recordings were made from excised inside-out membrane patches of transfected HEK-293 cells at room temperature. The patch pipette contained "O-Ca2+" solution (140 mM
NaCl/5 mM KCl/1 mM Na2-EGTA/10 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH
7.6). The bath perfusate before establishment of a membrane
seal was Ringer's solution (140 mM NaCl/5 mM KCl/10 mM
HepesNaOH/2 mM CaCl2/1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.6). Before
excision of the patch, the bath perfusate was switched to
"0-Ca2+" solution. Appropriate concentrations of cGMP were
added to the bath solution.
Immunocytochemistry. Transfected cells were harvested
from a culture dish, centrifuged, and, after resuspension,
pipetted onto a poly(D-lysine)-coated microscope slide. The
cells were fixed overnight in 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in
100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.3) at 4°C and then washed
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Triton X-100 (0.1%) was

genes, and among the patients with recessive RP were 6 known
to have pathogenic mutations in the rhodopsin, ROM1, RDS,
or the rod f3-phosphodiesterase genes. We identified two
categories of deviations from the published sequence (13). The
first group of anomalies were deemed polymorphisms or rare
variants unrelated to disease because (i) they were predicted
not to alter the sequence of the encoded protein, (ii) they did
not cosegregate with RP in families carrying them, or (iii) they
were found with approximately equal frequency among patients with dominant disease, recessive disease, or no disease
(i.e., unaffected individuals who served as controls). In this
category of presumably nonpathogenic sequence variations
were three silent changes in the coding region (affecting
codons Glu-100, Thr-469, and Phe-540), two missense changes
(Arg28Gln and Aspll4Asn), two single-base variations in
introns (A vs. T 29 bp upstream of exon 4 and C vs. T 26 bp
upstream of exon 6), and a variation in the length of a poly(A)
repeat in intron 8 (see Table 1 for allele frequencies).
The second group of anomalies all altered the sequence or
expression of the encoded protein and were ultimately interpreted as pathogenic mutations. Of the five mutations in this
group, three clearly were null alleles: two nonsense mutations
occurring early in the reading frame (Glu76End and
Lysl39End, Fig. 1 A and B) and a deletion of most or all of the
transcriptional unit that was indicated by the reduced intensity
of hybridizing bands by Southern blot analysis (data not
illustrated). Although the remaining two mutations altered the
sequence of the encoded protein, it was not obvious from
inspection whether they would interfere with the protein's
function. These were a missense mutation (Ser3l6Phe, Fig.
1C) in the fifth putative transmembrane domain and a frameshift mutation [Arg654(1-bp del), Fig. ID] near the end of the
reading frame that leads to the alteration of aa 654 and
truncation of the C-terminal 32 aa residues.
Cosegregation Analysis. Four families with autosomal recessive RP each segregated one or two of the five mutations.
In three of the families, the affected individuals were either
homozygous for a mutation [Arg 654(1-bp del) in family 6162,
Fig. 1E] or were compound heterozygotes (Lys139End and
Ser316Phe in family 7067, Fig. iF; Ser316Phe and gene
deletion in family B162, Fig. 1G). Unaffected relatives either
had no mutation or were heterozygote carriers for only one
mutation. Based on the cosegregation of these mutations with
the disease and the results from the expression of the
Ser316Phe and Arg654(1-bp del) mutations in vitro (see below), we concluded that these mutations are the cause of RP
in these three families.
In the fourth family with recessive RP (family 6829, Fig. lH),
the nonsense mutation Glu76End was present heterozygously
in the two affected sisters and in their unaffected father. No
mutation was detected in the maternally derived allele in the
two affected sisters. In fact, analysis with the polymorphism

Aspll4Asn showed that they received different alleles at this
locus from their mother (Fig. 1H). Because of the absence of
a pathogenic mutation in the maternally derived alleles in
these two sisters, it is possible that there is a pathogenic
mutation in a gene encoding another subunit of the channel
protein or some other protein that interacts with the a subunit
and that the combination of the two defects is the cause of RP.
This explanation would be reminiscent of the digenic inheritance that has been previously discovered among some families
with RP in which affected members are double heterozygotes
for mutations in the unlinked peripherin/RDS and ROMI
genes (6). An alternative possibility is that this mutation is not
the cause of RP in this family.
One individual with autosomal dominant RP carried the
Ser316Phe mutation heterozygously. Five available affected
members of the corresponding family (6003) had been previously found to carry heterozygously the rhodopsin missense
mutation Pro347Leu (20), whereas the channel protein mutation was present only in two affected siblings and their
unaffected mother. There was no clear difference in phenotype
between the relatives who carried only the rhodopsin mutation

and the siblings who carried both the rhodopsin and the
channel protein mutations. We concluded that the rhodopsin
mutation was the cause of the siblings' retinitis pigmentosa and
that in addition they carried the recessive channel protein
mutation Ser316Phe by chance and without obvious effect.
Expression of the Ser316Phe and Arg654(1-bp del) Alleles
in Vitro. To check for any functional defects in the Ser316Phe
and Arg654(1-bp del) mutant proteins that might support their
role in RP, we introduced these mutations into a rod channel
cDNA sequence and transiently expressed the mutant proteins
in cultured HEK-293 cells. Inside-out patches of plasma
membrane were excised from transfected cells and tested for
sensitivity to bath-applied cGMP. With either mutant, the
frequency of detecting functional cGMP-activated channels
was extremely low. With the Ser316Phe point mutation, only
3 out of a total of 85 patches tested responded to cGMP. Two
of these responsive patches apparently had a single cGMPgated channel, while the third had perhaps 7 channels, as
judged from the size of the macroscopic current at a saturating
cGMP concentration. In parallel transfections with the wildtype cDNA, 15 out of 28 tested patches were responsive to
cGMP; the induced current was also generally much larger,
indicating the presence of a much greater number of channels
(between 8 and 470). With the Arg654(1-bp del) mutation,
only 1 out of 83 patches responded to cGMP, and it again had
a single channel; in contrast, 17 out of 37 patches in parallel
experiments with the wild-type channel responded to cGMP
with much larger currents (equivalent to between 13 and 170
channels per patch). Despite the low frequency of detected
mutant channels in the plasma membrane, these channels
nonetheless did not show significant deviations from the
normal channels in either the open-channel current or the
dependence on cGMP concentration. In Fig. 2 Left, singlechannel openings of the wild-type and the two mutant channels
are compared. In all three cases, the single-channel current at
+60 mV was -1.8 pA. The open times also appeared to be
comparable, though this parameter has not been examined
closely. In Fig. 2 Right, the dose-response relations between
current activation and cGMP concentration are plotted. There
is good agreement in this relation between wild-type channel
and the Arg654(1-bp del) mutant. The deviation in this
relation between wild-type and the Ser316Phe mutant also
may not be significant, because the sample size for the mutant
is too small; K112 values for the wild-type channel have been
observed to be as large as 100 ,uM (10, 13). The possibility that
the cGMP-gated channels on the plasma membrane of cells
transfected with the mutant cDNAs represented endogenous

channels on HEK-293 cells seems unlikely because previous
work using mock-transfected cells (18) or cells transfected with
the channel 3-subunit cDNA alone (10) has not detected these
open-channel events.
To examine whether the paucity of expressed mutant channels on the plasma membrane of HEK-293 cells is due to poor
expression of the proteins or their failure to reach the surface
membrane, we stained the transfected cells with the monoclonal antibody PMc 2G11 (19), which recognizes an epitope
on the C-terminal segment; this epitope is still present in the
Ser316Phe and Arg654(1-bp del) proteins. Confocal microscopic images of the stained cells clearly show the wild-type
protein located almost exclusively on the surface membrane
of the HEK-293 cells (Fig. 3A), whereas the mutant proteins
appear to be predominantly trapped inside the cell (Fig. 3 B
and C). Collected data leading to a similar conclusion are
presented in Table 2. Mock-transfected cells were also
examined, and they did not show any staining (data not
shown). Thus, the mutant proteins were expressed, and the
rare presence of functional channels as assayed electrophysiologically appeared to be due to their failure to reach the
plasma membrane.

DISCUSSION
We have presented evidence that mutations in the gene
encoding the a subunit of the cGMP-gated channel protein are

tions). The nonailelic heterogeneity in RP is highlighted by the
recognition that '80% of cases are still without an identified
cause. Since three of the six identified genes code for proteins
in the phototransduction cascade, it is likely that genes encoding other members of this pathway will be found to be the
cause of some of the remaining cases.

of autosomal recessive RP. Three of the mutant alleles
(Glu76End, Lysl39End, and a deletion of the gene) are null
either because they would encode a protein without the
transmembrane domains and the pore forming region (Fig. 4)
or because they would encode no protein at all. When expressed in vitro, the remaining two alleles [Ser316Phe and
Arg654(1-bp del)] encoded channels that, while functional,
mostly failed to reach the plasma membrane. Based on these
observations, it is likely that the pathogenesis of photoreceptor
degeneration due to these mutations is a consequence of the
paucity or lack of cGMP-gated channels on the plasma membrane of the rod outer segments. An alternative explanation,
at least for the Ser316Phe and Arg654(1-bp del) mutant
proteins, would be that these mutant proteins cause disease by
accumulating inside the rod inner segment and by interfering
with protein processing or the general metabolism of the
photoreceptors, as thought to be the case for some rhodopsin
mutants causing autosomal dominant RP (21, 22). However,
this latter explanation does not seem likely in view of the
recessive nature of these channel mutations. The molecular
basis for the intracellular retention of the Ser316Phe and
Arg654(1-bp del) mutant proteins remains to be identified.
In normal rod photoreceptors, wild-type channels close in
the light due to a reduction in cytoplasmic cGMP. In patients
with RP due to these recessive null mutations, the rod photoreceptors would functionally mimic wild-type photoreceptors exposed to constant bright light because there would be
few or no open cGMP-gated channels. It remains undetermined whether this predicted perturbation in the physiology of
photoreceptors is actually the cause of their degeneration.
Mutations associated with the a subunit of the cGMP
channel were found to be responsible for only 3 or 4 out of 173
unrelated cases of recessive RP and none of 94 cases of
dominant RP. Since about half of all cases of RP are due to
autosomal recessive mutations, the gene encoding the a subunit of the channel protein accounts for only -1% of cases of
this disease. If one includes both dominant and recessive
mutations at the six RP loci so far identified, one locus
(rhodopsin) accounts for -10% of all cases (20) and the
remaining five loci together (peripherin/RDS, ROMI, the
subunit of cGMP-phosphodiesterase, myosin VIIA, and the a
subunit of the cGMP-gated channel) account for another
-10% of cases (refs. 3, 6, and 23 and unpublished observaa cause
