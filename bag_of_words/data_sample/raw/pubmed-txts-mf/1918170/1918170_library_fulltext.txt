Transforming Activity of Mutant Human
p53 Alleles

Mutant formsof the p53 gene have been shown to cooperate with an activated ras
gene in transforming primary cells in culture. The aberrant proteins encoded by
p53 mutants are thought to act in a dominant negative manner in these assays. In
vivo data, however, reveal that where p53 has undergone genetic change in
tumors, both alleles have been affected. We previously identified a case of h u m a n
acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in which both alleles of the p53 gene had
undergone independent missense mutations (at codons 135 cys to ser and 246 met
to val). In these blasts, p53 mutations appear to be acting recessively. We have
assayed the transforming potential of these p53 mutations, as well as that of
another mutation at codon 273, also identified in a human neoplasm. Both
mutations from the AML blasts (codon 135 and codon 246) confer transforming
ability on the mutant protein. While transformation assays may define functionally
different subsets of p53 mutations, the overexpression phenotype of mutants in
this assay may not accurately reflect the pathological effects of p53 mutations in
vivo.

cDNA prepared from the primary blasts of a patient
with acute myelogenous leukemia (Slingerland et al.,
1991). p53va1246H differs from pECH53 in having a
point mutation a t codon 246 that changes methionine
to valine. It was constructed by replacing a 372 bp
Bsu36I/StuI fragment in pECH53 with a corresponding
fragment from double stranded mutant p53 cDNA
prepared from AML blast cells. p53ser135H bears the
patient’s original arginine polymorphism (Matlashewski et al., 1987; Harris et al., 1986) a t codon 72,
while p53va1246H bears the proline polymorphism
encoded by pECH53 a t codon 72. p53his273H is a
human p53 cDNA vector with a mutation at codon 273
that converts a n arginine to histidine. This was derived
by the ligation into pECE of a 1.9 kb EcoRIiXbaI
fragment from pR4-2 (Harlow et al., 1985), a p53 cDNA
clone from a human vulvar carcinoma cell line. All
vectors were sequenced to verify the presence of the
mutations.

Transformation assay
Rat embryo fibroblasts (REFs) were prepared from
14-day-old Fisher rat embryos as described (Rovinski
and Benchimol, 1988); 3 x lo5 tertiary passage REFs
were plated on dishes 60 mm in diameter in 5 ml of
alpha minimal essential medium (a-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and transfected on the following day. The calcium phosphate
precipitate (Graham and Van der Eb, 1973; Wigler
et al., 1978) contained 10 pg of NIH3T3 carrier DNA,
with or without 2 pg of pEJ6.6 and with or without 4 pg
of p53pro193 or 2 pg of human p53 cDNA expression
vectors. Sixteen hours post-transfection, the cells were
washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fresh medium applied. Approximately 36 hours post-transfection, cells were trypsinized and replated onto three 60
mm dishes. Foci were scored 10-14 days after transfection.
Transient expression assay
The transfection protocol was modified to allow assessment of transient expression of transfected vectors in the human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line
SKOV-3. This cell line lacks endogenous g53 mRNA
and protein (Johnson et al., 1991); 5 x 10 cells were
plated on 60 mm dishes. On the next day they were
transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation of 12.5
pg of pECE based human cDNA vector and 10 pg NIH
3T3 carrier DNA. Cells were assessed for p53 protein
synthesis 40 to 48 hours post-transfection.
Antibodies
PAb419 is a n anti-SV40 large T antigen monoclonal
antibody that crossreacts with a 35 kD protein in
mammalian cells (Harlow et al., 1981). PAb421,
PAb240, PAb1620, and PAb1801 are anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies. PAb421 (Harlow et al., 1981) recognizes a denaturation resistant carboxy-terminal
epitope of p53 from several species (including rat and
human). PAb240 is specific for mutant p53 from several
species and was obtained from D. Lane (Gannon et al.,
1990). PAb1620 recognizes rodent and human p53
protein and was obtained from J. Milner (Milner et al.,
1987). PAbl801, which recognizes human p53 protein,
was obtained from L. Crawford (Banks et al., 1986).

Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation
Cells were metabolically labeled with [35S1-methionine and p53 protein was immunoprecipitated from cell
lysates a s previously described (Slingerland et al.,
1991). The lysis buffer was modified to include 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 50 pgiml aprotinin.
Pulse chase
Pulse chase analysis of [35S]-methioninelabeled p53
protein in AML blasts was a s described (Slingerland
et al., 1991).

RESULTS
Protein analysis
As reported previously, leukemic blast cells from a n
AML patient (patient D) were found to contain two
mutant p53 alleles. One allele bore a missense mutation a t codon 135, while the other allele bore a missense
mutation a t codon 246. The p53 protein expressed in
patient D blasts was very stable, with a half-life (t,)
exceeding 12 hours on pulse chase analysis (Fig. 1).
This is in contrast to the t of 1 hour reported for p53
expressed in normal activated human T lymphocytes
(Lubbert et al., 1989). The increased t of the mutant
p53 protein was reflected by its high steady-state level,
allowing detection by Western blotting (Slingerland
et al., 1991). Metabolic labeling revealed that the p53
protein expressed in these primary blasts was recognized by PAb240, a monoclonal antibody t h a t is believed to recognize only mutant forms of p53. Unexpectedly, binding of p53 protein to PAb1620 was also
seen (Fig. 2). This antibody is believed to recognize the
wild-type form of p53 protein, and in this regard is
similar to another monoclonal antibody, PAb246, that
preferentially recognizes the wild-type conformation of
mouse p53 protein (Cook and Milner, 1990).
To clarify the immunological phenotype of the proteins encoded by each mutant p53 allele, p53 cDNA
expression vectors bearing mutation at either codon
135 (p53ser135H) or codon 246 (p53va1246H) were
constructed. These were separately transfected into
SKOV-3 cells, a cell line lacking endogenous p53
expression. Forty to forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were metabolically labeled and p53
protein was immunoprecipitated from lysates. The
p53ser135H vector encodes a protein recognized by
the mutant-specific PAb240 but not by PAb1620.
p53va1246H encodes a protein that resembles wild-type
p53 in its ability to bind PAb1620 (Fig. 2); longer
exposure of the gel revealed a relatively weak, but
detectable reactivity with PAb240. When p53his273H
was transiently expressed in SKOV-3, the resulting
mutant protein also reacted with both PAb1620 and
PAb240 (data not shown). Reactivity of mutant human
p53 protein with both PAb1620 and PAb240 has been
noted previously (Rodrigues et al., 1990; Bartek et al.,
1990).

1990). It has been suggested that missense mutations

that confer transforming activity on the p53 gene
represent dominant negative mutations. Thus, certain
aberrant p53 polypeptides may participate in cellular
transformation by interfering in trans with the endogenous wild-type rat p53 protein.
The two mutant alleles detected in the blast cells of
patient D provided a n opportunity to test this model. In
these leukemic cells, the presence of two mutations

indicates that the mutations are recessive in vivo. At
least one of the mutations (whichever one occurred
first) cannot be a true dominant negative since mutation of the second allele favored clonal outgrowth of
these blasts in vivo. Moreover, the observation that one
of the mutant alleles (codon 246) encoded a PAb1620positive protein suggested that it might lack transforming activity and be truly recessive. We, therefore,

394

wished to assess whether or not either of the p53
missense mutant alleles from patient D encoded a
protein capable of the “dominant-negative” transforming phenotype when overexpressed with a n activated
ras gene in REFS.
The results of several repeated transfection experiments are shown in Table 1. Cotransfection of
p53va1246H with ras produced three- to elevenfold the
number of foci relative to transfection with ras alone.
The p53ser135H was also weakly transforming on
cotransfection with ras, with a three- to sixfold increase
in the number of foci over background. The p53his273H
vector produced no significant increase in the number
of foci over ras alone and resembled the wild type
human p53cDNA vector, pECH53, in its lack of transforming activity. The murine genomic p53 mutant,
p53pro193, cooperated with activated ras very effectively in the focus forming assay a s reported previously
(Munroe e t al., 1990) and served as a positive control in
this series of experiments.

DISCUSSION
Two mutant p53 alleles that behave recessively in
vivo are shown in this study to have dominantly
transforming activity when tested separately in REF
transformation assays. In the leukemic blasts of patient D, both p53 alleles contain single point mutations.
This patient did not have a germ-line p53 mutation
since neither mutation was detected in mononuclear
cells from a bone marrow sample obtained early in
disease remission. Only the codon 246 mutation could
be detected in a marrow sample obtained later in the
same remission, while both were detected a t disease
relapse, raising the possibility that the codon 246
mutation preceded that a t codon 135 (Slingerland et al.,
1991). Regardless of which mutation arose first, it is
unlikely that the first mutation conferred a fully
dominant negative phenotype. This would have obviated the growth advantage to be gained by mutation of
the second allele.
p53 gene mutations have been found in a broad
spectrum of human malignancies. When these mutations are detected, the wild-type allele is commonly not
present. This loss of heterozygosity supports the idea
that p53 missense mutations behave recessively in vivo
and are consistent with our data showing compound
heterozygous p53 mutations in primary blasts from a
leukemic patient.
In the evolution of malignancy, a proliferative advantage may be gained by a decrease in the cellular
concentration of wild-type p53 protein resulting from
negative mutation of one allele. Alternatively, certain
missense mutations may produce proteins that interfere with the wild-type product, either by bindinginactivation of the wild-type p53 protein or through
competition for binding sites on target molecules. Some
of these may be truly dominant negative, while in
others, the inhibition of wild-type function may be
incomplete. It has also been suggested that certain
missense mutations may provide p53 with novel
growth or tumor promoting properties (Wolf et al.,
1984). In most cases, however, disruption of the remaining wild-type allele may be a prerequisite for tumor
progression.

‘In these experiments, two independent transfections were performed on the same

It is interesting to note that the constitutive p53 gene
mutations found thus far in families with the LiFraumeni syndrome cluster between codons 245 to 258
(Malkin et al., 1990; Srivastava et al., 1990) and
bracket the codon 246 mutation we have described. In
this syndrome, the constitutive p53 mutations are
clearly not acting as true dominant negatives, a s
tumors arise in only certain tissues and, when tumors
occur, they are always accompanied by loss of the
wild-type p53 allele (Malkin et al., 1990).
The idea that certain missense p53 mutations behave
as dominant negatives is derived from and supported by
transformation assays of rat cells growing in culture.
As we and others (Munroe et al., 1990; Finlay et al.,
1988; Halevy e t al., 1990; Hinds et al., 1990) have
shown, not all the mutants behave similarly in this
type of assay. Different mutants vary in their transforming activity. p53his273H lacks transforming activity in the REF assay and may be a truly negative (loss
of function) mutant. Our observation that two mutant
p53 alleles (one encoding a PAbl620-positive protein
and the other a PAbl62O-negative protein) that behave
recessively in vivo have weak but reproducible transforming activity in transformation assays was unexpected and raises the possibility that transformation
assays may not accurately reflect the consequences of
mutant p53 expression in primary tumors. The overexpression of mutant p53 in transformation assays resulting from the presence of strong constitutive promoters
driving multiple gene copies may play a critical role in
eliciting morphological change. This degree of overexpression is unlikely to occur in primary tumors. The
significance of assessing the transforming activity of
human and mouse p53 alleles in cells of a different
species (rat) is also unclear and needs to be addressed.
