EXPERIMENTALPROCEDURES

Ornithine&aminotransferase
(OAT’; ~-ornithine:P-oxoacid aminotransferase; EC2.6.1.13) is a mitochondrial matrix
enzyme which catalyzes the reversible conversion of ornithine
and a-ketoglutarate to glutamate semialdehyde and glutamate. OAT monomers are synthesized as 49-kDa precursors
and processed to 45 kDa upon entry into the mitochondrial

Ornithine &Aminotransferase Mutations
Plasmids, Probes, and Cloning Vectors
Unless otherwise indicated pGEM4 (Promega) wasused for all
cloning manipulations. A plasmid containing human OAT cDNA,
phuOAT6, was used as the starting material for site-directed mutagenesis. This clone includes the complete (1317 bp) open reading
frame, 60 bp of 5'-nontranslated and the entire 635 bp of the 3'nontranslated region (4). The eukaryotic expression vector p91023b
was a gift of R. Kaufman, Genetics Institute (16). The plasmid,
pCH110, contains the Escherichia coli lac2 gene and produces
@-galactosidaseactivity in eukaryotic cells (17). pm@5is a full length
mouse @-tubulincDNA clone (18).
Restriction endonuclease digestion was used to isolate DNA segments for probe preparation. The desired restriction fragments were
gel purified and labeled with [a-32P]dCTPby random hexamer priming (19).

RNase A Protection
Detection of single nucleotide mismatches in RNA-RNA hybrids
was performed as previously described (12, 21, 22). Riboprobes were
made from three phuOAT6 subclones: EcoRI-BamHI (bp -60 to 660),
HinfI-SmaI (bp 608 to 1282),or HinfI -Hind111 (bp 608 to 1386) which
span the protein coding region of the wild type OAT mRNA (12).
The products of the RNase protection reaction were separated on a
6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (23) and their size was used to
predict the location of the mismatched bases.
Single Strand ConformationalPolymorphism (SSCP)
SSCP analysis was performed on the products of PCR amplification of OAT exons plus flanking splice sequences from genomic DNA
as described by Orita et al. (24) with the modification that
dATP and [a-35S]dCTPwere incorporated during the amplification
reaction.
Confirmation of Mutations
Any exon with a putative mutation was amplified at least twice
and sequenced in both directions. The presence of a mutation was
confirmed in genomic DNA by demonstration of a restriction site
alteration, if this was a predicted result of the mutation, and/or by
allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to slot-blotted products
of additional PCR amplification of the genomic DNAof the proband
and other available members of the pedigree (25,26).
Mutant cDNA Construction
cDNA Subclones from GA Patient Fibroblast RNA-Mutant OAT
cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of patient fibroblast
RNA (12). DNA cassettes containing the mutations R180T, A184A,
and L402P were synthesized by PCR amplification of the relevant
region of the appropriate cDNA as described (20). The amplified
PCR products were digested at unique restriction sites flanking the
mutation. The mutant cassette was gel purified in a 2% low melting
point agarose gel (BRL), excised, and subcloned into thecorresponding region of phuOAT6. The presence of the mutation and theabsence
of any other alterations was confirmed by sequencing the entire region
corresponding to the mutantcassette and cloning restriction sites in
the recombinant mutant clone.
Cloning of Mutations by Site-directed Mutagenesis-DNA cassettes
containing MlI, R154L, R271K,P417L, and L437F wereconstructed
by site-directed mutagenesis. Oligonucleotides containing the desired
mutation (18 to 56-mers) were synthesized. In the case of M1I and
P417L, both the mutation and a nearby unique restriction site were
included in the oligonucleotide. For each of the other mutations, a
total of four oligonucleotideswere synthesized (Fig. 1). phuOAT6 (10
ng) was used as a template for PCR (100 pl of reaction, Gene AMP

DNA Sequencing
Double stranded plasmid DNAwas alkaline denatured and sequenced with T7 DNA polymerase according the manufacturer's
directions (PharmaciaLKB
Biotechnology Inc.). Sequencing of
cloned PCR material was performed on pools of clones to dilute any
clone with a random Taq polymerase error and to insure representation of both alleles. For direct sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments, the amplified products were passed twice through Centricon30 filters (Amicon) or gel-purified and sequenced directly using either
the PCR primers or internal oligonucleotideprimers and [a-%]dATP
to label the products (20).

the amplification reaction cycled between 94 "C and thepredicted T ,
( T , = 4 "C per G or C nucleotide 2 "C per A or T nucleotide) of
the primer with the lower melting point using a 15-5 dwell-time at
each temperature. After 25 cycles, the products were elongated at
72 "C for 4 min. An aliquot (10 pl) of the reaction was electrophoresed
ona 5% agarose gel (3% Nusieve, FMC, 2% Type I, Sigma) and
visualized with ethidium bromide to evaluate the amplification. To
remove any nucleotides added beyond the template by Taq polymerase
(27), we used the 3' - 5' exonuclease activity of Klenow fragment by
incubating the remainder of the reaction mixture with Klenow fragment (6 units) and deoxynucleotide triphosphate (250 WM each) for
30 min at 37 "C (23). The product was purified with Geneclean (Bio
101), eluted, and the 5' ends phosphorylated with polynucleotide
kinase (15-20 units, as directed by the supplier, Boehringer Mannheim). The reaction mixture was diluted to 50 pl with H,O and a 20pl aliquot digested with appropriate restriction enzymes. Fragments
of the correct size were gel purified in 2% low melting point agarose
and subcloned into theappropriate site of phuOAT6.
For mutations which were not within 50 bp of a unique restriction
site (R154L, R271K, and L437F), themutant cDNAswere constructed as a two-part cassettewith left and right arms (Fig. 1). The
desired mutation was incorporated into one of the two oligonucleotides which form the junction between the arms of the cassette (27).
A triple ligation (vector-unique site 1-left arm-blunt-right arm-unique
site 2-vector) was required to generate the complete mutant cassette
which was then ligated into thecorresponding sites of phuOAT6. To
confirm that thedesired mutation was the only alteration introduced
into the huOAT cDNA, the region corresponding to theentire cassette
and the cloning restriction sites was sequenced. The full-length
recombinant OAT cDNA was removedfrom pGEM4 with EcoRI and
ligated into p91023b for expression.

Transfections
DNA transfection (28) was performed using as the recipient cells
(12) our NC5 subclone of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, CHOK1, which lacks endogenous OAT mRNA, protein, and activity.
Enzyme Assays
Cell lysate OAT activity was measured radiochemically (29). A
standard assay mixture contained 0.7 mM L-ornithine, 0.7 mM aketoglutarate, 16 pM pyridoxal phosphate, 0.1 M KPO, (pH 8.0), 0.10

methods was influenced by several features of the OAT gene.
First, itis a relatively small autosomal gene (11exons of 52793 bp). Second, it is expressed in cultured fibroblasts, so that
mutant OAT mRNA could be isolated and characterized.
Third, by initial Southern and Northern blot analysis in each
GA family (datanot
shown), we foundno
large rearrangements of the OAT gene. Therefore, methods of mutation detection with sensitivity adequate to detectpoint
mutations were required.
For the OAT alleles reported herewe mainly employed two
screening methods to localize mutations, RNase A protection
and SSCP. Although RNase A digestion detects many single
base pairmismatches (34), it requires large amounts of mRNA

and radioactivity and has imperfect sensitivity since some
mismatches are not cleaved (34). We estimate that we detected approximately 50% of the OAT mutations in the cell
lines we studied by RNase A protection. Although the sensitivity of the RNase A technique theoretically could be improved by using each strand of PCR amplified cDNA as the
target sequence, we have largely abandoned this method in
favor of SSCP analysis of amplified exons. This latter technique has proved to be simpler and more sensitive (35).
All the OAT mutations described in this report (summarized in Table I) are subtle alterations in coding regions of
the OAT gene. Most (20) are nucleotide substitutions, including 11transitions andnine transversions, while the remaining

we infer the mutationis pathologic because these alleles were
found only in GA patients and not in 30 unrelated controls
(60 chromosomes). For those missense mutations which we
have not analyzed by expression studies, we cannot exclude
the possibility that theidentified mutation is neutral and the
functionallysignificant mutation was undetected by our
screening methods. However, the observation that 10 of these
12 mutations alter amino acids conserved between Saccharomyces cereuisiae and humanOAT suggests that the mutations
alter residues important for OAT structure and/or function
(see below, Fig. 4).
At the mRNA level most of the OAT mutant alleles have a
normal amount of normally sized message. Four alleles,
H53fs(-1), 1127fs(+l), E318fs(-1), and N334fs(-1), have
markedly reduced levels of fibroblast OAT mRNA. In these,
the open reading frame is truncated to77, 384,983, and 1065
nucleotides, respectively, incontrasttothe
1317-bp open
reading frame of wild type OAT. These truncated open readingframes endin exons 3,4, 9, and 10, respectively, as
compared to wild type OAT, which terminates translation in
the 11th exon. One allele, R396ter, terminates translation
prematurely but still in exon 11 and has normal amounts of
OAT mRNA (G40lter could not be scored because it is present
in a compound heterozygote). Thus, as hasbeen observed in
@-globin(36), dihydrofolate reductase (37), and triose-phosphate isomerase (38), premature termination in the terminal
exon of OAT seems to have no effect on mRNA levels but
termination in the penultimate exon or earlier is associated
with markedly reduced levels of mRNA.
The most common phenotype of the OAT mutation at the
protein level is a lack of immunoreactive OAT peptide. Of the
20 alleles (10 in homozygous individuals) with normal
amounts of OAT mRNA, two (10%) have normal amounts of
OAT antigen.The remainder have little or no detectableOAT
antigen.Interestingly, 12 of these 20 alleles have simple
missense mutations. With the caveat that absence of OAT
protein is defined as a failure to react with an antipeptide
antibody, we tentatively classify these 13 alleles as protein
destabilizing missense mutations. Destabilizing mutations
often result inthe disruption of hydrophobic and electrostatic

five are small (1-3 bp) deletions or insertions. Of the transitions, three represent C d T or G d A mutations a t one of the
26 CpG dinucleotide pairs found in the 1317-bp coding sequence of the OAT gene. Themutationsare
distributed
throughout the OAT protein and have various consequences
on the primary amino acid sequence. The majority (18/25)
are missense mutations: four are frameshifts; two are nonsense mutations; and one is an in-frame deletion of a single
codon. For 12 alleles (Y55H, N89K, C93F, P241L, Y245C,

interactions within the protein core (39). Ten of these destabilizing missense mutations (N89K, P241L, Y245C, A270P,
R271K, G353D,G375A,C393R, L402P, and P417L) effect
residues conserved between S. cerevisiae (40), rat and human
OAT (Fig. 4). The two mutations altering nonconserved res- I
idues (A270P and R250P) both involve proline. This imino
acid forms the least flexible peptide bond (41) so it is not
surprising that substitution by proline at thesepositions
would be deleterious to OAT structure (39). The importance
of A270 is reinforced by the observation that even a conservative substitution at the next residue (R271K) produces an
OAT antigen negative phenotype.
Two of the missense OAT mutations, R180T and R154L,
completely inactivate OAT function without reducing OAT
antigen, In other enzymes whose structure is better understood, mutations which alter function without an effect on
stability often involve residues that participate in the active
site (39,42,43).R180 and R154 are conserved in S. cerevisiae
OAT. We speculate that these residues may be involved in
the active site of OAT.
Curiously, one allele, P417L/L437F, has two missense mutations in cis as shown by sequencing PCR-generated cDNA
clones and pedigree analysis (data not shown).Two missense
mutations in cis have been described in an allele for glycoasparaginase and an allele for glucocerebrosidase, the genes
affected in aspartylglucoseaminuria (44) and Gaucher disease
(45), respectively. To determine if P417L and L437F were
acting in concert or independently to cause OAT inactivation,
we cloned each separately and expressed them in transient
transfection assays. The P417L mutation is mRNA positive,
antigen negative, and activity negative; L437F, by contrast,
had no discernable effect on OAT mRNA, protein, or activity
(Fig. 3). These results are consistent with predictions from
the yeast human OAT homology. P417 is conserved while the
residue in S. cereuisiae corresponding to L437 is an asparate.
The residues at codons 438 and 439of the human enzyme
also have diverged as compared with those in S. cerevisiae.
This suggests that alterations at theextreme C terminus of
the protein aretolerated. We conclude that L437F is a neutral
mutation while P417L inactivates OAT.

Note Added in Proof-Since

submission of this manuscript, we
have had the opportunity to study fibroblasts from a patient homozygous for the P417L/L437F allele. Our results confirm that this is
an mRNA-positive, antigen-negative, activity-negative allele.
