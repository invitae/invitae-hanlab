Argininosuccinate
synthetase catalyzes the conversion
of
citrulline
and aspartate to argininosuccinate
(1). The enzyme
is present in all tissues and cultured cells studied, but the
highest enzyme activity is in the liver where the enzyme
functions in the urea cycle to eliminate ammonia (1). Analysis
of genomic DNA clones indicates the presence of multipleprocessed dispersed pseudogenes
and of a single large expressed gene for argininosuccinate
synthetase
(1, 2). The

expressed gene spans 63 kilobase pairs (kb)l and is composed
of at least 16 exons (1).
Deficiency of this enzyme results in an autosomal recessive
disorder, citrullinemia
(3). Patients with this disorder exhibit
profound
elevations of ammonia and citrulline
in the blood.
The majority of such patients present in the neonatal period
with hyperammonemic
coma. The molecular basis of disease
has been studied and shown to be heterogenous
(1, 4). Sl
nuclease analysis of patients’
RNA suggests one class of
mutation producing RNA with Sl nuclease-detectable
defects
(1, 4). To elucidate the molecular nature of these mutations,
a study was undertaken
of an argininosuccinate
synthetase
mutation
in a fibroblast
cell line of a citrullinemia
patient,
CG; the mutation
was known to be homozygous
for an Sl
nuclease-detectable
defect (4).

The cloned argininosuccinate
synthetase
gene from
a citrullinemia
patient’s
fibroblast
cell line revealed
a
single base substitution
(G to C) within
the splice acceptor site of the last intron.
The mutation
abolished
normal
RNA splicing,
and, by cDNA analysis,
three
abnormal
splicing
pathways
were demonstrated.
The
major
pathway
involved
the activation
of a cryptic
acceptor
site in the last exon that resulted
in a deletion
of seven nucleotides
in the mature RNA. Another
pathway involved
a downstream
cryptic
acceptor
site, that
is 388 nucleotides
downstream
from the first cryptic
site. Northern
blot analysis
showed
that this second
cryptic
site is present
on the minor
2.7-kilobase
mRNA, but not on the major species of argininosuccinate synthetase
mRNA, which is 1.7-kilobases
in length.
Using this aberrant
cDNA as a probe, the cDNA of the
2.7-kilobase
mRNA was isolated and studied. Sequence
analysis
suggests
that this species of RNA is the one
that bypasses the polyadenylation
signal employed
by
the 1.7-kilobase
RNA. Since both transcripts
encounter the same translation
termination
codon, both RNAs
should encode identical
protein.
Furthermore,
a tract
of 22 repeats of d(CA)*(GT)
is found at the 3’ end of
the gene and this repeat sequence is present on the 2.7kilobase
RNA.
The third
pathway
of the abnormal
splicing
revealed
a rare class of transcript
that has the
last intron
retained
in the mature
RNA.
This study
shows that in human
the intron
inclusion
can occur
through
a naturally
occurring
point mutation.
All these
abnormally
spliced RNAs resulted
in a protein

tained the mutated splice acceptor site and intron 15 sequence
(Fig. 3). Besides, the 5’ end of intron 15 which includes the
splice donor site was also present on this cDNA (data not
shown). Thus, it became clear that the large size of this cDNA
was due to the inclusion of intron 15 in the mature RNA (Fig.
3). To examine the percentage of the RNA that retains this
intron, an Sl nuclease mapping analysis was carried out. The
probe was a 5’ end-labeled
genomic DNA fragment
that
covered part of intron 14 to exon 16 (Fig. 4). The size of the
protected fragment in this analysis can be predicted from the
cDNA sequence and was demonstrated
in Fig. 4. Therefore,
if wild type RNA (pbAS1 as template
for in uitro RNA
synthesis) was used in the Sl analysis, the protected fragment
would be 222 nucleotides in length (Fig. 4, lane 4). In mutant
RNA, if the splicing pattern is as in pCGc5, the protected
fragment would be 215 nucleotides
(Fig. 4, lane 5), and if the
entire intron 15 remained on RNA as in pCGc1, the protected
fragment will be about 1800 nucleotides in length (Fig. 4, lane
6). When poly(A+) RNA from a citrullinemia
cell line AC (1),
that is known to be normal in this region of the argininosuccinate synthetase
gene was employed as a control in Sl
nuclease analysis, a fragment of 222 nucleotides in length was
protected as would be expected (Fig. 4, lane 1). However, when

study suggested that citrullinemia
patient
CG has an Sl
nuclease detectable abnormality
toward the 3’ end of the
RNA (4). Therefore, effort has focused on the study of the 3’
end of the mutant gene by screening the CG genomic library
with a unique sequence probe inside intron 14 of the gene.
The use of the intron probe also eliminated
the isolation of
processed pseudogenes (1, 2). By sequencing the intron-exon
junctions
of the isolated genomic clones, a single base mismatch from G- to C- was found to occur at the splice acceptor
site of intron 15, the last intron of this gene. (Fig. 1). The
conserved sequence of the 3’ splice site was changed from AG
to AC.
Analysis of cDNA, pCGc5 from Citrullinemia

study
the effect of the splice acceptor site mutation on RNA processing, the cDNAs of argininosuccinate
synthetase from patient CG were analyzed. The partial restriction
mapping of
cDNA clones pCGc1, pCGc5, and pCGcl3 suggested that they
were reversely transcribed
from different species of argininosuccinate synthetase RNAs. To study their identities,
DNA
sequences of these cDNAs were determined.
Fig. 2 compares
the sequence of wild type cDNA, pAS1, and mutant cDNA
pCGc5. The sequence was identical until the end of exon 15.
After that, there was a deletion of seven nucleotides
at the
beginning
of exon 16 in pCGc5 as compared with the wild
type cDNA. The 3’ end of the deleted sequence was the AG
dinucleotide,
the same sequence as in the normal splice acceptor site. Apparently
a cryptic splice site, seven nucleotides
away from the authentic
site, was activated, resulting
in a
deletion of seven nucleotides on mutant RNA.

RNA from citrullinemia
patient CG was used, a major fragment, 215 nucleotides,
and a minor one, 1800 nucleotides,
were detected (Fig. 4, lane 2). By densitometer
scanning, the
ratio of these two fragments is about 50 to 1. Clearly, most of
the mutant RNA was processed to a cryptic acceptor site on
exon 16 as in pCGc5, whereas a small percentage of RNA was
processed with intron
15 unspliced.
In this study, a 222nucleotide
fragment presumed to be the protected fragment
by the wild type RNA was also detected in lane 2 where RNA
was from citrullinemia
CG. This was due to incomplete digestion by Sl nuclease, since this fragment was also detected in
lane 5 where the in uitro synthesized
RNA from pCGc5
template was employed. No other extra protected fragment
was observed when comparing
the pattern by control RNA
(lane 1) and by mutant RNA (lane Z), suggesting there was
no detectable cryptic acceptor site inside intron 15.

sequence analysis of cDNA, pCGcl3,
showed that the sequence 3’ from the exon 15 is different from the sequence in
pCGc1 and pCGc5 and does not correspond
to any of the
known cDNA sequence. From the result of Sl nuclease analy-

Synthetase

sis in Fig. 4, it was known that there is no cryptic acceptor
site inside intron 15. Therefore, the sequence at the 3’ end of
the cDNA of pCGcl3 could not have come from the intron 15
sequence. Sequence comparison between wild type cDNA and
genomic DNA of argininosuccinate
synthetase indicates that
exon 16 is the last, exon in mature RNA. However, previous
study has shown that there are two species of argininosuccinate synthetase RNA (11): a major one, about 1.7 kb in size,
and a minor one, about 2.7 kb in size (Ref. 11 and Fig. 5A).
The ratio of these two species of RNA is about 50 to 1 (11).
The exact relationship
of these two species of RNA is not
known, but preliminary
results suggest that the size difference
is at the 3’ end of the RNA. Therefore
the possibility
was
explored that RNA of pCGcl3
was produced by aberrant
splicing to a cryptic site, the sequence of which is only present
on the 2.7-kb mRNA. A DNA fragment at the 3’ end of the
pCGcl3 that differed from the wild type cDNA sequence was
used as a probe for Northern
blot analysis with RNA from a
human hepatoma cell line and two citrullinemia
cell lines AC
and CG (Fig. 5). When using pAS1 cDNA as a probe (Fig.
5A), both 2.7- and 1.7-kb transcripts
from a human hepatoma
cell line were hybridized as expected (Fig. 5A, lane I), whereas
a much weaker signal was observed in citrullinemia
cell lines
(Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3). With Northern
blot analysis using a
probe that was derived from the 3’ end of the pCGcl3, it is
clear that this probe hybridized
preferentially
to the 2.7-kb
RNA (Fig. 5B, lane I), suggesting that the 3’ end of pCGcl3
was from this species of RNA. Thus, in RNA of pCGcl3, the
3’ end of the exon 15 was joined to a sequence that was only
present in the 2.7.kb RNA. The hybridization
signal is much
weaker in RNAs from citrullinemia
cell lines than that from
hepatoma (Fig. 5). This is because liver is known to express
much higher argininosuccinate
synthetase mRNA than any
other organ studied (1). The citrullinemia
cell line AC used
in this study is known to involve an RNA negative allele (1).
The finding that the hybridization
signal in CG RNA (Fig.
5A, lane 3) is about twice of that in AC RNA (Fig. 5A, lane 2)
suggests that the splicing defect in the CG cell line does not
significantly
affect its RNA stability. It is of interest to note
that although the major species of 1.7.kb RNA is about the
same size in both hepatoma and citrullinemia
CG (Fig. 5A,
lanes 1 and 3), the minor species of RNA in CG is about 2.3
kb in size which is smaller than the 2.7.kb RNA detected in
human hepatoma (Fig. 5, lanes I and 3).
To elucidate the relationship
between 2.7. and 1.7-kb RNAs
that are both transcribed
from the argininosuccinate
synthetase locus, the cDNA specific to 2.7-kb RNA was isolated

Argininosuccinate

A Splice Acceptor Site Mutation

in Human Argininosuccinate

DISCUSSION

This study demonstrates
that a G- to C- substitution
in
splice acceptor site (AG to AC) of intron 15 of argininosuccinate synthetase is responsible for the deficiency of this enzyme
in citrullinemia
patient CG. The mutation
leads to the production of aberrantly
spliced RNA. By cDNA analysis, at
least three abnormal splicing events can occur because of this
mutation.
This resulted in reading frame-shifting
at the Cterminal
end of argininosuccinate
synthetase. Although
the
mutation
only affects the last 15 amino acids of this 45kilodalton
protein, the resulting protein not only has lost its
enzyme activity but also has no cross-reaction
material being

detected (1). Apparently
the C-terminal
sequence of this
protein is important
for maintaining
its stability.
By Sl nuclease mapping and cDNA analysis (pCGc5), the
major argininosuccinate
synthetase RNA in this cell line is
the one with a seven-nucleotide
deletion in exon 16. The
deletion is the result of aberrant splicing that has joined exon
15 to a cryptic acceptor site, seven nucleotides
downstream
from the authentic splice site. If this RNA is translated, the
mutant protein will replace the C-terminal
14 amino acids
with a 39-amino acid peptide of different sequence.
By cDNA analysis, it was shown that in addition to this
site, another downstream
cryptic acceptor site on the last
exon can also be activated. The resulting RNA joined exon
15 to a sequence that only presents in a 2.7-kb minor species
of argininosuccinate
synthetase
RNA (pCGcl3).
Sequence
comparison
of cDNAs and genomic DNA suggested that this
2.7-kb RNA is the one that bypasses the polyadenylation
signal, ATAAAA
(Ref. 16, Fig. 8). The inefficiency
of this
signal in polyadenylation
may have resulted from its sequence
variation
from the consensus sequence, AATAAA
(17, 18).
Nevertheless,
both 2.7- and 1.7-kb RNA encounter the same

from a human hepatoma cDNA library using the 3’ DNA
fragment of pCGcl3 as a probe. The cDNA obtained is designated as “PAS-L.”
Sequence comparison of pAS1 and PASL, which were cDNA from 1.7- and 2.7-kb RNA, respectively,
showed that the entire 3’ end sequence of pAS1 is within the
sequence of PAS-L (data not shown). This result suggests
that the 2.7-kb RNA is a transcript
that bypasses the polyadenylation
signal employed by the 1.7-kb RNA. The PAS-L,
the cDNA of 2.7-kb RNA, has its 3’ end extended about 800
nucleotides from the 3’ end of pAS1 clone. No open reading
frame longer than 50 amino acids was found within this 800nucleotide region. Within this region, the restriction
enzyme
mapping and DNA sequence analysis showed that the sequence is colinear to that in genomic DNA (data not shown).
The clone, PAS-L, is about 200 nucleotides
short at 3’ end.
Whether
any RNA splicing involved
in this region is unknown. DNA sequence analysis of PAS-L showed that there
is a tract of poly(GT)
at the 3’untranslated
region of this
2.7-kb RNA (Fig. 6). This sequence is located at 23 nucleotides
downstream
from the poly(A) addition site of the 1.7-kb RNA
(Fig. 6). The number of GT unit in this cDNA is 22. However,
length variation was found when genomic clone from another
individual
was sequenced which showed 19 tandem repeats of
the GT unit (data not shown).
In order to understand
the defect in pCGcl3, both pCGcl3
and PAS-L DNAs were sequenced and compared. In pCGcl3,
there is a deletion of 395 nucleotides beginning
at the exon
16 and ending at an AG dinucleotide
(Fig. 7). Apparently,
this
AG dinucleotide
served as a splicing acceptor site. The result
suggests that the production
of the aberrant
transcript
of
pCGcl3 was due to the activation
of a downstream
cryptic
acceptor site. The deleted region includes both translation
termination
codon and the major polyadenylation
signal. If
the RNA is translated, the mutant protein will replace the Cterminal
15 amino acids of the wild type protein with a 55
amino acid peptide of different sequence.

in Human Argininosuccinate

RNAs detected in citrullinemia CG (Fig. 5). If the upstream
cryptic site was also in use in processing the larger species of
RNA in citrullinemia CG, then the 2.7-kb RNA should also
be detected. The fact that only 2.3-kb RNA was detected in
citrullinemia CG suggests that most if not all of the larger
species of RNA was spliced to the downstream cryptic site.
The result supports the hypothesis that machinery of splicing
and polyadenylation communicates to each other at the last
exon.
The study of RNA splicing reaction in vitro has provided
important information on its mechanisms (28). It has been
demonstrated that formation of the 3’ splice complex may be
an essential step in the formation of the stable 5’ nucleoprotein complex and that constructed mutation at the 3’ splice
AG sequence reduced 5’ cleavage and abolishes splicing (29).
However when tested in uiuo, the same mutations elicit efficient splicing at a cryptic, rather than the correct, 3’ splice
site. Our study of acceptor site mutation demonstrated that
indeed the 3’ site mutation does sometimes abolish the splicing reaction in ho. The mutation described here should
provide examples to allow further elucidation of the mechanism of RNA splicing.

translation termination site; therefore, both transcripts
should encode identical proteins. Furthermore, the 2.7-kb
RNA is present in every cell type examined and the ratio of
these two species of RNA is about constant, suggesting that
this bypassing phenomenon is not regulated. Interestingly, a
tract of poly(dCA.dGT) was found at the 3’ end of the gene.
This sequence is located immediately downstream from the
last exon of the 1.7-kb RNA and this sequence is transcribed
and present on the mature 2.7-kb RNA. The poly(dCA. GT)
family has been reported to locate at the 5’ or 3’ end of several
genes (19). However, in those instances, this repeat sequence
is located several kilobases from the stably transcribed portion
of the genes. In this study, length polymorphism of the repeat
unit was found as has been reported (20). However, the length
variation alone is not large enough to serve as a DNA polymorphic marker (20). Poly(dCA . dGT) has a number of unique
physico-chemical properties (21, 22) and has been suggested
to have a regulatory function (19, 23). The role of this sequence on argininosuccinate synthetase expression remains
to be studied.
In this study, a third type of abnormal splicing event was
also detected. DNA sequence analysis suggested that the
intron 15 remained unspliced in this class of RNA. Although
the entire intron in this cDNA has not been sequenced, the
presence of both splice donor and acceptor sites of intron 15
in this cDNA suggests that no small splicing has occurred in
this intron. The result of Sl nuclease analysis further showed
that this RNA is a minor species that is present in only about
2% of mature argininosuccinate synthetase RNA.
This study demonstrated that a naturally occurring splice
site mutation in the last intron of argininosuccinate synthetase gene can result in multiple splicing abnormalities (Fig.
8B). Similarly, the study of the defects in ,&globin genes
present in several forms of @-thalassemia has provided examples of natural splicing mutants (24). Mutations in /3thalassemia that are known to affect the 3’ splice site include
one which is a small deletion involving the 3’ acceptor site
and the upstream polypyrimidine stretch of the first intron;
another is a single base mutation in the splice acceptor (AG
to GG) at the second intron of P-globin gene (25, 26). The
former mutant was shown to abolish splicing of that intron,
whereas the latter resulted in activation of a cryptic acceptor
site in the intron (25,26). The nature of the mutation studied
here resembles the second mutation described in P-thalassemia in that both involved mutation in the 3’ splice consensus
sequence. However, the mutation in the fi-globin gene resulted
in the activation of a cryptic site upstream from the correct
splice site, whereas in the argininosuccinate synthetase mutation studied here, at least three abnormally spliced pathways can be demonstrated (Fig. 8B). At the 5’ end of both
cryptic AG sequences, a conserved branch point region
(UUAAU) and a pyrimidine-rich stretch could be identified
although the cryptic site closer to the authentic site is much
more efficient than the other. It has been suggested that
splicing and polyadenylation machinery communicate across
the terminal exon to direct the spliceosome assembly (27).
Since exon 16 is the last exon in this gene and there are two
polyadenylation signals for argininosuccinate synthetase
RNA, the two cryptic sites may respond to the spliceosome
assembly with respect to individual polyadenylation recognition signals. This may explain why there are two cryptic sites
in use and also their relative efficiencies. In addition, the
RNA analysis showed that there were only 2.3- and 1.7-kb

Synthetase
