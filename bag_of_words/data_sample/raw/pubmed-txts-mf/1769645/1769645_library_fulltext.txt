INTRODUCTION

Classical phenylketonuria
(PKU) is an autosomal
recessive disease that results from severe deficiency of
the liver enzyme phenylalanine
hydroxylase (PAH).
Ever since it was first described by Fijlling in 1934,
PKU has served as a model for understanding
the
biochemical basis of inherited disorders, the heterogeneity hidden behind a common clinical phenotype,
and the impact of genetics on society and public
health. Studies of the molecular genetic basis of the
inability of affected individuals to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine began in 1985, when the structure of
the PAH gene became known (DiLella et al., 1986a).
Initial investigations limited to Danish families suggested that the genetic basis of severe PKU is relatively homogeneous, with a high prevalence of RFLP

Patients
This study included 47 German and 29 Bulgarian
PKU patients. RFLP analysis and haplotype distribution in most of these families have been reported

haplotypes 2 and 3, which were subsequently demonstrated to be linked to specific mutations (DiLella et
aZ., 198613, 1987). Today, there is sufIlcient evidence
that PKU can be caused by multiple allelic mutations
in the PAH gene and that gradients in the geographical distribution
of the major PKU haplotypes and associated mutations exist even on the old continent
(Dwomiczak et al., 1989, 1991; John et al., 1990; Kalaydjieva et aZ., 1991).
A particular pattern emerged from studies of PKU
families from southern Europe, where polymorphic
haplotype 6 was found to be unusually frequent (17 to
40% of mutant alleles), to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with the disease, and to be associated with a
severe phenylalanine
hydroxylase
deficiency (Kalaydjieva et aZ., 1990; Dianzani et al., 1990; Stuhrmann
et al., 1989; Lichter-Konecki
et al., 1989). This suggested linkage of haplotype 6 to a single mutation
whose nature remained unknown.
Here we report the identification
of a G to A transition in intron 10 of the phenylalanine
hydroxylase
gene which is in 100% linkage with mutant RFLP
haplotype 6. In addition, the nucleotide exchange is in
tight linkage to PKU haplotypes 10 and 36, which are
found mainly in the Bulgarian and Turkish populations. The mutation is located 11 bp upstream from
the intron/exon
boundary and activates a cryptic
splice site resulting in an in-frame insertion of 9 nucleotides (nt) between exon 10 and exon 11 of the
processed mRNA.

We report a mutation within the phenylalanine
hydroxylase (PAH) gene that causes aberrant splicing of the mRNA
and that is in tight association
with chromosomal
haplotypes 6,10, and 36. Because of the high frequency of these
particular
haplotypes in Bulgaria,
Italy, and Turkey, it appears to be one of the more frequent
defects in the PAH
gene causing classical phenylketonuria
in this part of Europe. The mutation is a G to A transition
at position 546 in
intron 10 of the PAH gene, 11 bp upstream from the intron
lO/exon 11 boundary.
It activates a cryptic splice site and
results in an in-frame
insertion
of 9 nucleotides
between
exon 10 and exon 11 of the processed mRNA. Normal
amounts of liver PAH protein are present in homozygous
patients, but no catalytic activity can be detected. This loss
of enzyme activity is probably
caused by conformational
changes resulting
from the insertion
of three additional
amino acids (Gly-Leu-Gln)
between the normal sequences
encoded by exon 10 and exon 11. o 1991 Academic P-, I~C.

alleles from German patients and 11 alleles from Bulgarian patients belonged to haplotype 6; 4 Bulgarian
alleles belonged to haplotype 10, and 3 German alleles
belonged to haplotype 36. In addition to the originally
studied patients, 17 haplotype 6 PKU alleles (11 from
Italy, 5 from Turkey, 1 from Lituania) and 5 haplotype 36 alleles from Turkey were analyzed. The clinical phenotypes of the patients carrying haplotype 6,
10, or 36 alleles fitted the criteria for classical PKU as
described by Striver et al. (1989).

LKB according to the instructions of the manufacturer, and extensively digested with DNase I. Aliquots
of the poly(A)+ RNA preparations
were used in reverse transcription reactions. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed following the standard protocol,
using 2 pg of poly(A)+ RNA, 20 pmol of oligonucleotide primer AP410 (Table l), 20 units of AMV reverse
transcriptase (Pharmacia), and 20 units of RNase inhibitor (RNAguard, Pharmacia). A one-tenth aliquot
of the cDNA-synthesis
reaction mixtures was used for
PCR amplification
with AP234 and AP482 as

et al., 1975). In vitro determination of PAH activity was performed
as described
(Bartholome et cd., 1975).
RESULTS

Direct sequence analysis of exon 11 and the flanking introns in a haplotype l/haplotype
6 compound
heterozygote revealed a G to A transition in intron 10
nt 546, located 11 bp upstream from the intron lo/
exon 11 boundary (Fig. 2). Analysis of the parental
alleles traced the mutation to the haplotype 6 PKU
allele and confirmed Mendelian inheritance. No other
mutation within the entire’ coding ‘sequence or exon/
intron boundaries of this particular PKU gene was
detected.
The base substitution creates a sequence motif that
is very similar to the consensus sequence of the cannonical splice acceptor site in eukaryotic
cells
(Breathnach and Chambon, 1981). We therefore assumed activation of a cryptic splice acceptor site in
intron 10 that could cause abnormal RNA processing
and result in a transcript that is 9 nucleotides longer
than the normal product (Fig. 3). Since the reading
frame is not altered, this mRNA would be translated
into a protein with an in-frame insertion of three
amino acids (Gly-Leu-Gln)
between the normal sequences encoded by exon 10 and exon 11.
For testing the “aberrant splicing” hypothesis, the
PCR-amplified
intron
10 sequences (homozygous
normal and homozygous mutant) were inserted at the
correct position between exon 10 and exon 11 of the
PAH cDNA cloned into pSVL (Dworniczak et al.,
1991). In a transient expression experiment, monkey
COS cells were transfected with pSVL/PAH
IVS-1On
and pSVL/PAH
IVS-1Om and the isolated poly(A)+

RNA was used for cDNA synthesis. The correctness
of splicing of the primary transcript was investigated
by direct sequencing of the PCR-amplified
cDNA.
Amplification
of the cDNA derived from cells
transfected with pSVL/PAH
IVS-1On resulted in the
435bp fragment expected from the positions of the
PCR primers (AP234 and AP482, Table 1). Direct sequence analysis of this product confirmed correct
splicing of the inserted intron 10 from the primary
transcript and thus proved the validity of the experimental approach. PCR amplification
of the cDNA
from pSVL/PAH
IVS-1Om produced a slightly longer
fragment,
indicating already the presence of additional nucleotides in the mRNA. In this PCR mixture
only trace amounts of the normal fragment (435 bp)
could be detected by using a sensitive silver stain of
the PCR products separated on a polyacrylamide
gel
(PhastSystem,
Pharmacia;
data not shown). Sequence analysis of the PCR product obtained from
the mutant cDNA confirmed the predicted presence
of 9 additional nucleotides inserted between exon i0
and exon 11, thus proving the predominant
use of the
splice acceptor site created by the mutation (Fig. 4).

the catalytic activity of the resulting translation product was investigated in a liver sample obtained by needle biopsy from a patient homozygous for the mutation. The presence of the protein in the patient’s liver
was shown by Western .blot analysis, where polyclonal rabbit anti-human
PAH antibodies demonstrated
a band comigrating with the normal control and comparable in amount (Fig. 5). The phenylalanine hydroxylase activity assay demonstrated
no conver,sion of
‘*C-labeled phenylalanine
into tyrosine in the patient’s liver, thus proving that despite the presence of
immunologically
reactive PAH protein in substantial
amounts, catalytic activity had been. , abolished (data
not shown).
To establish the ,extent of linkage with chromosomal haplotype 6, the panel of German and Bulgarian PKU families (76 PKU alleles .representing. 14
different RFLP haplotypes and 76 PAH alleles representing 20 different!RFLP
haplotypes) was screened
for the presence of a DdeI restriction site created by
the nucleotide substitution
at nt 546,in intron 10. In
the presence of the mutation the 295bp PCR product
(AP255 and AP264) can be cleaved into two fragments of 246 and 49 bp in length (data not shown).
The ,mutation was not detected on any normal allele
and was invariably present on all German and Bulgarian haplotype 6 PKU alleles (13 of 13), thus suggesting 100% association with this mutant haplotype.
When this screen was extended to 17 haplotype 6 alleles from Italy, Turkey, and Lithuania, tight linkage
of the splicing defect with this particular haplotype
was substantiated, all 17 alleles were positive with respect to the mutation. Surprisingly, this analysis also
uncovered tight association with haplotype 10 (4 of 4)
and haplotype 36 (8 of 8) PKU alleles.

tic splice site and results in an in-frame insertion of 9
nucleotides between exon 10 and exon 11 of the processed mRNA. Analysis of the mRNA obtained from
transfected monkey COS cells showed that despite
the presence of the normal splice acceptor site of exon
il in the primary transcript, the cryptic splice acceptor side is preferentially
used. This is in full agreement with observations that during splicing the acceptor site that is closest to the branch-point
sequence is predominantly
used (Reed and Maniatis,
1986). In addition, the mutant sequence has a closer
resemblance to the consensus splice site (Breathnach
and Chambon, 1981) than to the normal intron lO/
exon 11 boundary of the PAH gene and might therefore represent a stronger splice signal.
From the sequence of the abnormally processed
RNA transcript,
the insertion of three additional
amino acids (Gly-Leu-Gln)
in the protein can be predicted. Analysis of a liver biopsy sample obtained
from. a patient homozygous for the splicing defect in
intron
I,0 demonstrated
that the altered* protein
structure does not change the stability of the protein,
but has a profound effect on catalytic activity. The
enzyme deficiency established in vitro is in full agreement with the severe course of PKU previously reported in patients with mutant haplotype 6 alleles
(Lichter-Konecki
et al., 1989; Dianzani et al., 1990;
Kalaydjieva et aZ., 1990) and also observed in the
group of patients included in.this study. It provides
further evidence in support of the previous suggestion
that the catalytic function of PAH resides within the
carboxyl terminus .of the protein molecule (Kwok et
al., 1985).
,
Screening a panel of PKU patients from different
ethnic origins uncovered that PKU chromosomes of
three different polymorphic
characteristics
(haplotypes 6, 10, and 36) are tightly linked to the IVS-10
splicing defect. Although a recurrent .mutation in different haplotypes of the PAH gene cannot be ruled
out, comparative-studies
suggest another ex.planation
for tight linkage of this mutation to different PKU
haplotypes. Haplotypes
6 and 10 exhibit identical
polymorphic patterns 3’ to the PuuII (b) site in intron
3. With respect to the 5’ end of the PAH gene up to the
polymorphic
EcoRI site in intron 5, haplotype 10 is
identical to the frequent haplotypes 1 to 4. A haplotype 10 allele carrying the mutation could therefore
result from a single recombination
event between a
mutant haplotype 6 chromosome and one of the normal haplotypes 1 to 4. A single mutation that destroys
the polymorphic EcoRI site converts a mutant haplotype 6 allele into the mutant haplotype 36 allele.
These assumptions
appear to be conceivable, although extensive data on the evolution of normal and
mutant PAH alleles are not yet available for further
evaluation.
Molecular analysis of PAH alleles in different Euro-

246

DWORNICZAK

pean countries has revealed that the majority of PKU
alleles are associated with a limited number of haplotypes. However, significant differences in the geographical distribution
of particular haplotypes have
been observed (Daiger et aZ., 1989). In the northern
part of Europe haplotype 3 accounts for a large proportion of PKU alleles, whereas it is nearly absent in
Mediterranean
populations.
In the southern part of
Europe haplotype 6, rarely detected in northern countries, accounts for up to 40% of all PKU chromosomes. Its frequency is outweighed only by that of
haplotype 1 (Stuhrmann et al, 1989; Lichter-Konecki
et al., 1989; Kalaydjieva et al., 1990; Dianzani et al.,
1990), whose molecular heterogeneity is now well documented (Abadie et al., 1989; Dworniczak et al., 1991;
Kalaydjieva et al, 1991).
Existing data on the frequencies of haplotypes 6,
10, and 36 and the 100% association of the defect in
IVS-10 nt 546 with these haplotypes established in
different ethnic groups in this study suggest that this
mutation is one of the more frequent defects in the
PAH gene found in Caucasians and the major cause of
classical phenylketonuria
in southern Europeans.
