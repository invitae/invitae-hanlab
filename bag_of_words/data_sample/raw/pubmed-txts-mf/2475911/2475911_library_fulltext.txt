Identification

the Cystic Fibrosis Gene:
Cloning and Characterization of
Complementary DNA
of

Overlapping complementary DNA clones were isolated
from epithelial cell libraries with a genomic DNA segment containing a portion of the putative cystic fibrosis
(CF) locus, which is on chromosome 7. Transcripts,
approximately 6500 nucleotides in size, were detectable
in the tissues affected in patients with CF. The predicted
protein consists of two similar motifs, each with (i) a
domain having properties consistent with membrane association and (ii) a domain believed to be involved in ATP
(adenosine triphosphate) binding. A deletion of three
base pairs that results in the omission of a phenylalanine
residue at the center of the first predicted nucleotidebinding domain was detected in CF patients.

C

YSTIC FIBROSIS (CF) IS AN AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE GENET-

ic disorder affecting a number of organs, including the lung
airways, pancreas, and sweat glands (1). Abnormally high
electrical potential differences have been detected across the epithelial surfaces of the CF respiratory tract, including the trachea and
nasal polyps, as well as across the walls of CF sweat gland secretory
coils and reabsorptive ducts (2). The basic defect has been associated
with decreased chloride ion conductance across the apical membrane
of the epithelial cells (3). That the defect also appeared to persist in
cultured cells derived from several epithelial tissues suggested that
the CF gene is expressed in these cells (4). More recently, patch
clamp studies showed that this defect is probably due to a failure of
an outwardly rectifying anion channel to respond to phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) or
protein kinase C (5). Although progress has been made in the

isolation of polypeptide components of an epithelial chloride channel that mediates conductance (6), their relation to the kinaseactivated pathway and CF has yet to be established, and the basic
biochemical defect in CF remains unknown.
Molecular cloning experiments have permitted the isolation of a
large, contiguous segment of DNA spanning at least four transcribed sequences from a region thought to contain the CF locus
(7). These sequences were initially identified on the basis of their
ability to detect conserved sequences in other animal species by
DNA hybridization and were subsequently characterized by RNA
hybridization experiments, cDNA isolation, and direct DNA sequence analysis (7). Three of the transcribed regions were excluded
from being the CF locus by earlier genetic or DNA sequence
analyses (7, 8). The fourth one, as shown by genetic analysis (9) and
DNA sequencing analysis presented below, corresponds to a portion of the CF gene locus.
Isolation of cDNA clones. Two DNA segments (E4.3 and
H1.6) that detected cross-species hybridization signals (7) were used
as probes to screen cDNA libraries made from several tissues and cell
types (10). After screening seven different libraries, one single clone
(10-1) was isolated with H1.6 from a cDNA library made from the
cultured epithelial cells of the sweat glands of an unaffected (nonCF) individual (10).
DNA sequencing showed that 10-1 contained an insert of 920
base pairs (bp) in size and one potential, long open reading frame
(ORF). Since one end of the sequence shared perfect sequence
identity with H1.6, it was concluded that the cDNA clone was
probably derived from this region. The DNA sequence in common
was, however, only 113 bp long (Figs. 1 and 2). This sequence in
fact corresponded to the first axon of the putative CF gene. The
short sequence overlap thus explained the weak hybridization signals
in library screening and our inability to detect transcripts in RNA
gel-blot analysis. In addition, the orientation of the transcription
unit was tentatively established on the basis of alignment of the
genomic DNA sequence with the presumptive ORF of 10-1.
Since the corresponding transcript was estimated to be about
6500 nucleotides in length by RNA gel-blot hybridization experiments, further cDNA library screening was required in order to
clone the remainder of the coding region. As a result of several
successive screenings with cDNA libraries generated from the colon
carcinoma cell line T84, normal and CF sweat gland cells, pancreas,

(Fig. 3). The analysis revealed a prominent band, about
size, in T84 cells. Identical results were obtained with
other cDNA clones as probes. Similar, strong hybridization signals
were also detected in pancreas and primary cultures of cells from
nasal polyps, suggesting that the mature mRNA of the putative CF
signals, probably repregene is about 6.5 kb. Minor hybridization

and adult lungs, 18 additional clones were isolated (Fig. 1). DNA
sequence analysis revealed that none of these cDNA clones corresponded to the length of the observed transcript, but it was possible
to derive a consensus sequence based on overlapping regions.
Further cDNA clones corresponding to the 5' and 3' ends of the
transcript were derived from 5' and 3' primer-extension experiments
(Fig. 1). Together, these clones span about 6.1 kb and contain an
ORF capable of encoding a protein of 1480 amino acids (Fig. 2).
It was unusual that most of the cDNA clones isolated here
contained sequence insertions at various locations (Fig. 1).While
many of these extra sequences corresponded to intron regions
reverse-transcribed during the construction of the cDNA, as revealed on alignment with genomic DNA sequences, the identities of
several others were uncertain because they did not align with
sequences at the corresponding exon-intron junctions, namely, the
sequences at the 5' ends of clones 13a and T16-1 and at the 5' and
3' ends of TI1, and the insertions between exons 3 and 4 in 13a and
between exons 10 and 11 in T16-4.5 (legend to Fig. 1). More
puzzling were the sequences corresponding to the reverse complement of exon 6 at the 5' end of1 la and the insertion of a segment of
a bacterial transposon in clone C16-1; none of these could be
explained by mRNA processing errors.
In that the number of recombinant cDNA clones for the putative
CF gene detected in the library screening was much less than would
have been expected from the abundance of transcripts estimated
from RNA hybridization experiments, it seemed probable that the
clones that contained aberrant structures were preferentially retained
while the proper clones were lost during propagation. Consistent
with this interpretation, poor growth was observed for most of our
recombinant clones isolated, regardless of the vector used.
RNA analysis. To visualize the transcript of the putative CF
gene, we used RNA gel-blot hybridization with the 10-1 cDNA as

Fig. 2. Nucleotide sequence of cDNA encoding the CF transmembrane
conductance regulator together with the deduced amino acid sequence.
DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method
(34) with 35S-labeled nucleotides or by the Dupont Genesis2000 automatic
DNA sequencer. Numbers on the left of columns indicate base positions and
numbers on the right amino acid residue positions. The first base position
corresponds to the first nucleotide in the 5' extension clone PA3-5, which is
one nucleotide longer than TB2-7 (12). The 3' end and the noncoding
sequence are shown above [nucleotides 4561 to 6129 plus the poly(A)
tail]. Arrows indicate position of transcription initiation site by primer
extention analysis (11). Nucleotide 6129 is followed by a poly(A) tract.
Positions of exon junctions are indicated by vertical lines. Potential membrane-spanning segments ascertained with the use of the algorithm of
Eisenberg et al. (35) are enclosed in boxes. Amino acids comprising putative
ATP-binding folds are underlined. Possible sites of phosphorylation (21) by
protein kinases A or C are indicated by open and closed circles, respectively.
The open triangle indicates the position at which 3 bp are deleted in CF.
Abbreviations for the amino acid residues are: A, Ala; C, Cys; D, Asp; E,

coding region of the CF locus could be deduced from
overlapping cDNA clones. Since most of the cDNA clones were
apparently derived from unprocessed transcripts, further studies
were performed to ensure the authenticity of the consensus sequence. Each cDNA clone was first tested for chromosome localization by hybridization analysis with a human-hamster somatic cell
hybrid containing a single human chromosome 7 and by pulsed field
gel electrophoresis (7). The ones that did not map to the correct
region on chromosome 7 were not pursued. Fine restriction enzyme
mapping was then performed for each clone. While overlapping
regions were clearly identified for most of the clones, many contained single copy, additional regions not readily recognizable by

The cDNA was fither characterized in gel hybridization experiFive to six different restriction fragments
could be detected with the 10-1 cDNA in Eco RI- or Hind IIIdigested total human DNA and a similar number of fragments with
several other cDNA clones, suggesting the presence of multiple
exons for the putative CF gene. The hybridization studies also
identified the cDNA clones with unprocessed intron sequences
when they showed preferential hybridization to a smaller subset of
genomic DNA fragments with relatively greater intensities. For the
confirmed cDNA clones, their corresponding genomic DNA segments were isolated (7) and the exons and exon-intron boundaries
were sequenced. In all, 24 exons were identified (Fig. 2). Physical
mapping experiments (7) showed that the gene locus spanned about
250 kb.
The 5' terminus of the transcript was determined by primer
extension (11). A modified polymerase chain reaction, anchored
PCR (12), was also used to facilitate cloning of the 5' end sequences.

Fig. 4. DNA sequence around the AF508 deletion. The normal sequence
from base position 1627 to 1651 (from cDNA T16-1) is shown beside the
CF sequence (from cDNA C16-1). The left panel shows the sequences from
the coding strands obtained with the B primer (5'-GTlTlCCTGGATTATGCCTGGGCAC-3') and the right panel those from the opposite strand
with the D primer (5'-GTITGGCATGCTlllGATGACGCITC-3'). The
brackets indicate the three nucleotides in the normal that are absent in CF
(arrowheads). Sequencing was performed as described in (34).

Two independent 5' extension clones, one from pancreas and the
other from T84 RNA, were characterized by DNA sequencing and
differed by only 1 base in length, thus establishing the most
probable initiation site for the transcript (Fig. 2). Since the initial
cDNA clones did not contain a poly(A) + tail indicative ofthe end of
a mRNA, anchored PCR was also applied to the 3' end of the
transcript (12). The results derived from the use of several different
3 '-extending oligonucleotides were consistent with the interpretaRESEARCH ARTICLES

tion that the end of the transcript was about 1.2 kb downstream of
the Hind III site at nucleotide position 5027 (Fig. 2).
The complete cDNA sequence spans 6129 base pairs excluding
the poly(A)+ tail at the end of the 3' untranslated region and it
contains an ORF capable of encoding a polypeptide of 1480 amino
acids (Fig. 2). An ATG (AUG) triplet is present at the beginning of
this ORF (base position 133-135). Since the nucleotide sequence
surrounding this codon (5'-AGACCAUGCA-3') has the proposed
features of the consensus sequence (CC)ACCAUGG(G) of a eukaryotic translation initiation site (13), with a highly conserved
A at the -3 position, it is highly probable that this AUG corresponds to the first methionine codon for the putative polypeptide.

Fig. 6. Alignment of the three most conserved segments of the amino acid
sequences (single letter code) of the extended NBF's of CFTR with
comparable regions of other proteins. These three segments consist of
residues 433 to 473, 488 to 513, and 542 to 584 of the amino-terminal (N)
half and 1219 to 1259, 1277 to 1302, and 1340 to 1382 of the carboxvlterminal (C) half of CFTR. The heavy overlining points out the regions of
greatest similarity. The star indicates the position corresponding to the
phenylalanine that is deleted in CF. Additional general homology can be seen
even with the introduction of very few gaps. The other sequences are of
proteins involved in multidrug resistance in human (hmdrl), mouse (mmdr
1 and 2) (16), and Plasmodium falciparum (pfmdr) (38); the a-factor pheromone export system of yeast (STE6) (39); the hemolysin (hlyB) system of E.

sequences derived from CF and unaffected (N) individuals was next
conducted. Two clones, C16-1 and Cl-1/5, were derived from a CF
sweat gland cDNA library and together they spanned almost the
entire coding region. The most striking difference between CF and
N sequences was a 3-bp deletion (Fig. 4), which would result in a
loss of a phenylalanine residue (position 508) in the predicted CF
polypeptide. This deletion (AF508) was detected in both CF clones.
To exclude the possibility that this difference was due to a cloning
artifact, sequence-specific oligonucleotides were used to screen
DNA samples from CF families. Specific hybridization could be
observed for each oligonucleotide probe with genomic DNA amplified by PCR, confirming the presence of corresponding genomic
DNA sequences (9). Furthermore, the oligonucleotide specific for
the 3-bp deletion hybridized to 68 percent of chromosomes carrying
a CF mutation but not to any of the normal chromosomes (0/198),
an indication that a silent sequence polymorphism was unlikely.
Sequence differences found elsewhere among the different cDNA
clones probably represented sequence polymorphisms or cDNA
cloning artifacts (14).
Predicted protein structure. Analysis of the sequence of the
overlapping cDNA clones (Fig. 2) predicted a polypeptide of 1480
amino acids with a molecular mass of 168,138 daltons. The most
characteristic feature of the predicted protein is the presence of two
repeated motifs, each of which consists of a domain capable of
spanning the membrane several times and sequences resembling
consensus nucleotide (ATP)-binding folds (NBF's) (15) (Figs. 5 and
6). These characteristics are remarkably similar to those of the
mammalian multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (16) and a number
of other membrane-associated proteins (as discussed below), suggesting that the predicted CF gene product is likely to be involved in
the transport of substances (ions) across the membrane and is
probably a member of a membrane protein superfamily (17). For the
convenience of future discussion and to avoid confusion with the
previously named CF protein and CF factor (18), we will call the

Rhizobium (46); FtsE is a protein that contributes to the regulation of cell
division (47). In addition to these proteins that contain this long NBF, there
is a large number of others that contain the two short nucleotide binding
motifs A and B initially pointed out by Walker et al. (48). Further, there are
other proteins containing only motif A or B (49).

putative CF gene product the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).
Each of the predicted membrane-associated regions of CFTR
consists of six hydrophobic segments capable of spanning a lipid
bilayer (19), which are followed by a large hydrophilic region
containing the NBF's (Fig. 5). On the basis of sequence alignment
with other nucleotide-binding proteins, each of the putative NBF's
in CFTR comprises at least 150 residues (Fig. 6). The single residue
deletion (AF508) detected in most of the CF patients is in the first
NBF, between the two most highly conserved segments within this
sequence. The amino acid sequence identity between the region
surrounding the AF508 mutation and the corresponding regions of
several other proteins suggests that this region is of functional
importance (Fig. 6). A hydrophobic amino acid, usually one with an
aromatic side chain, is present in most of these proteins at the
position corresponding to Phe508 of CFTR.
Despite the overall symmetry in the two-motif structure of the
protein and the sequence conservation of the NBF's, sequence
identity between the two motifs of the predicted CFTR protein is
modest. The strongest identity is between sequences at the carboxyl
ends of the NBF's. Of the 66 residues aligned within these regions,
27 percent are identical and 11 percent are functionally similar. The
overall, weak internal sequence identity is in contrast to the much
higher degree (>70 percent) in P-glycoprotein for which a sequence
duplication hypothesis has been proposed (16). The lack of conservation in the relative positions of the exon-intron boundaries in the
CF gene also argues against recent exon duplication as a mechanism
in the evolution of this gene (Fig. 2).
Since there is apparently no signal-peptide sequence at the amino
terminus of CFTR (Fig. 7), the highly charged hydrophilic segment
preceding the first transmembrane sequence is probably oriented in
the cytoplasm. Each of the two sets of hydrophobic helices are
expected to form three traversing loops across the membrane and
little of the sequence of the entire protein is expected to be exposed
to the exterior surface, except the region between transmembrane
segments 7 and 8. It is of interest that the latter region contains two
potential sites for N-linked glycosylation (20).
A highly charged cytoplasmic domain can be identified in the
middle of the predicted CFTR polypeptide, linking the two halves
of the protein. This domain, named the R domain, is operationally
defined by a single large exon in which 69 ofthe 241 amino acids are
polar residues arranged in alternating clusters of positive and
negative charges. Moreover, nine of the ten sites at which there are
consensus sequences for phosphorylation by protein kinase A and
seven of the potential substrate sites for protein kinase C found in
CFTR are located in this exon (21).
Properties of CFTR could be further derived from comparison to
other membrane-associated proteins (Fig. 6). In addition to the
overall structural similarity with P-glycoproteins, each of the two
predicted motifs in CFTR shows resemblance to the single motif
structure of hemolysin B of Escherichia coli (22) and the product of
the White gene of Drosophila (23). These proteins are involved in the
transport of the lytic peptide of the hemolysin system and of eye
pigment molecules, respectively. The vitamin B12 transport system
of E. coli, BtuD (24), and MbpX (25), which is a liverwort
chloroplast gene product whose function is unknown, also have a
similar structural motif. Further, CFTR shares structural similarity
with several of the periplasmic solute transport systems of Gramnegative bacteria, where the transmembrane region and the ATPbinding folds are contained in separate proteins that function in
concert with a third substrate-binding polypeptide (26).
The overall structural arrangement of the transmembrane domains in CFTR is similar to several cation channel proteins (27) and
some cation-translocating adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) (28)

terminus of CFTR shows some identity (12/18) with the raf serinethreonine kinase proto-oncogene product of Xenopus laevis (31).
Finally, a sequence identity (10 of 13 amino acid residues) has
been noted between a hydrophilic segment (position 701 to 713)
within the highly charged R domain of CFTR and a region
immediately preceding the first transmembrane loop of the sodium
channels in both rat brain and eel (32). This feature of CFTR is not
shared with the topologically closely related P-glycoprotein; the
241-amino acid linking peptide is apparently the major difference
between the two proteins.
Relevance to the CF anion transport defect. In view of the
genetic data of Kerem et al. (9) and the tissue specificity and
predicted properties of the CFTR protein, it is reasonable to
conclude that CFTR is directly responsible for CF. It remains
unclear, however, how CFTR is involved in the reg-ulation of ion
conductance across the apical membrane of epithelial cells.
It is possible that CFTR serves as an ion channel itself. For
example, 10 of the 12 putative transmembrane regions contain one
or more amino acids with charged side chains (Fig. 7), a property
similar to that of the brain sodium channel and the -y-aminobutyric
acid (GABA) receptor chloride channel subunits, where charged
residues are present in four of the six, and three of the four,
respective membrane-associated domains per subunit or repeat unit
(32, 33). The amphipathic nature of these transmembrane segments
is believed to contribute to the channel-forming capacity of these
molecules. In contrast, the closely related P-glycoprotein, which is
RESEARCH ARTICLES

not believed to conduct ions, has only two charged residues in all 12
transmembrane domains. Alternatively, CFTR may not be an ion
channel but instead it may serve to regulate ion channel activities. In
support of the latter possibility, none of the recently purified
polypeptides (from trachea and kidney) that are capable of reconstituting chloride channels in lipid membranes (6) appear to be CFTR,
judged on the basis of molecular mass.
. In any case, the presence of ATP-binding domains in CFTR
suggests that ATP hydrolysis is directly involved and required for
the transport function. The high density of phosphorylation sites for
protein kinases A and C and the clusters of charged residues in the R
domain may both serve to regulate this activity. The deletion of
Phe508 in the NBF may prevent proper binding of ATP or the
conformational change required for normal CFTR activity, consequently resulting in the observed insensitivity to activation by
protein kinase A- or protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of
the CF apical chloride conductance pathway (5). Since the predicted
structure of CFTR contains several conserved domains and belongs
to a family of proteins, most of which function as parts of
multicomponent molecular systems (15), the CFTR protein may
also participate in epithelial cell functions not related to ion
transport.
To understand the basic defect in CF, it is necessary to determine
the precise role of Phe508 in the regulation of ion transport and to
understand the mechanism that leads to the pathophysiology of the
disease. With the CF gene (that is, the cDNA) now isolated, it
should be possible to elucidate the control of ion transport pathways
in epithelial cells in general. Knowledge gained from study ofthe CF
gene product (CFIR), both the normal and mutant forms, will
provide a molecular basis for the development of improved means of
treatment of the disease.

10. The cDNA libraries from cultured epithelial cells were prepared as follows: sweat
gland cells derived from a non-CF individual and from a CF patient were grown to
first passage as described [G. Collie, M. Buchwald, P. Harper, J. R. Riordan, In
Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 21, 592 (1985)]. The presence in these cells of an outwardly
rectifying Cl- channel was confirmed (J. A. Tabcharani, T. J. Jensen, J. R.
Riordan, J. W. Hanrahan, J. Membrane Biol., in press), but the CF cells were
insensitive to activation by cyclic AMP [T. J. Jensen, J. W. Hanrahan, J. A.
Tabcharani, M. Buchwald, J. R. Riordan, Pediatric Pulmonol. Suppl. 2, 100 (1988)].
Polyadenylated RNA was isolated [J. M. Chirgwin, A. E. Przybyla, R. J.
Macdonald, W. J. Rutter, Biochemistry 18, 5294 (1979); H. Aviv and P. Leder,
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 69, 1408 (1972)] and used as template for the
synthesis of cDNA according to U. Gubler and B. Hoffman [Gene 25, 263
(1983)]. After methylation of internal Eco RI sites, ends were made flush with T4
DNA polymerase, and phosphorylated Eco RI linkers were added to the cDNA.
After digestion with Eco RI and removal of excess linkers, the cDNA products
were ligated into the Eco RI site of X ZAP (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The same
procedures were used to construct a library from RNA isolated from preconfluent
cultures of the T84 colon carcinoma cell line [K. Dharmsathaphorn, J. A.
McRoberts, K. G. Mandel, L. D. Tisdale, H. Masui, Am. J. Physiol. 246, G204
(1984)]. The numbers of independent recombinants in the three libraries were: 2.0
x 106 for the non-CF sweat gland cells, 4.5 x 106 for the CF sweat gland cells, and

3.2 x 10' from T84 cells. Standard procedures were used for screening [T.
Maniatis, E. F. Fritsch, J. Sambrook, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1982)]. Bluescript plasmids
were rescued from plaque-purified clones by excision with M13 helper phage
(Stratagene). The lung and pancreas libraries were purchased from Clontech Lab
Inc. (Catalog Nos. HL1066b and HL1069h, respectively).
The start point of the CF gene transcript was derived by primer extension
procedures [F. J. Calzone, R. J. Britten, E. H. Davidson, Methods Enzymol. 152,
611 (1987)]. The oligonucleotide primer [positioned 157 nucleotides (nt) from
the 5' end of the 10-1 clone] was end-labeled with [y-32P]ATP (Amersham, 5000
Ci/mmole) and T4 polynucleotide kinase, purified by gel filtration, and annealed
with -5 pLg of T84 poly(A)+ RNA for 2 hours at 60°C. The extension reaction
was performed at 41'C for 1 hour with avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse
transcriptase (Life Sciences, Inc.) and terminated by addition of NaOH to 0.4M
and EDTA to 20 mM, with subsequent neutralization with ammonium acetate
(pH 4.6). The products were treated with phenol, precipitated with ethanol,
redissolved in buffer with formamide, and analyzed on a polyacrylamide sequencing gel.
The anchored PCR procedure [M. A. Frohman, M. K. Dush, G. R. Martin,
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 8998 (1988)] was used to synthesize
cDNA corresponding to the 5' and 3' ends of the transcript. For the 5' end clones,
poly(A)+ RNA from pancreas and T84 cells were subjected to reverse-transcription
with the use of an exon 2-specific primer (11). The first strand cDNA products
were fractionated on an agarose column and the fractions containing large species
were identified by gel electrophoresis after the polymerase chain reaction [R. K.
Saiki et al., Science 230, 1350 (1985)] with a pair of oligonucleotide primers (145
nt apart within the 10- 1 sequence) just 5' of the extension primer. These products
were pooled, concentrated, and treated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
(BRL) and dATP, as recommended by the supplier. Second strand synthesis was
performed with Taq Polymerase (Cetus, AmpliTaq) and an oligonucleotide
containing a linker sequence, 5'-CGGAATTCTCGAGATC(T)12-3'. This linker,
together with another primer (internal to the extension primer) with an Eco RI
restriction site at its 5' end, was then used for PCR. After digestion with Eco RI
and Bgl II, products were purified and cloned in Bluescript KS (Stratagene) by
standard procedures. All the recovered clones contained inserts of more than 350
nt. The 3' end clones were generated with the use of similar procedures. PCR
amplification was carried out with the linker described above and an oligonucleotide with the sequence 5'-ATGAAGTCCAAGGATITAG-3', which is -70 nt
upstream ofthe Hind III site at position 5027 (Fig. 2). The products were digested
with Hind III and Xho I and cloned in the Bluescript vector. Candidate clones were
identified by hybridization with the 3' end of cDNA T16-4.5. All PCR's were
performed for 30 cycles as described by the enzyme supplier.

Other sequence differences were noted between the normal (T16-4.5) and CF (Cl1/5) cDNA clones. At position 2629 (Fig. 2), T16-4.5 contained a C and Cl-1/5 a
T, resulting in a change of Leu to Phe. At position 4555, the base was G in T16-4.5
but A in Cl-1/5 (Val to Met). The differences may be results of cDNA cloning
artifacts or may represent sequence polymorphisms. Specific oligonucleotide
hybridization analysis of patient or family DNA should distinguish these possibilities. Since these changes are conserved amino acid substitutions, they are unlikely
to be causative mutations. Additional nucleotide differences were observed in the 3'
untranslated region between different cDNA clones and the corresponding genomic DNA sequence.

Several large families of integral membrane proteins are known, including: (i) A
number of ligand-gated ion channels of which the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
[R. M. Stroud and J. Finer-Moore, Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1, 317 (1985)] is the
prototype. Receptors for the inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA (33) and glycine
are included in this family. (ii) A family of ion channels with a totally different
structural motif are the voltage-gated, sodium, calcium, and potassium channels
(27). (iii) Involved in the translocation of ions are the structurally related cation
pumps such as the Ca2`-ATPase [C. J. Brandl, N. M. Green, B. Korczak, D. H.
MacLennan, Cell 44, 597 (1986)], the Na+,K+-ATPase [G. E. Shull and J. B.
Lingrel, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 4039 (1987)], and the H+,K+-ATPase
[G. E. Shull and J. B. Lingrel, J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16788 (1986)]. These are but

some functional relation between these short segments of the primary structure of
the Na+ channel and CFIR. Similarities between sequences at the same relative
locations with respect to the COOH-termini of the raf kinase and CFIR suggest
that they may also share at least a small facet of their structures and functions.

Approximately 70 percent of the mutations in cystic
fibrosis patients correspond to a specific deletion of three
base pairs, which results in the loss of a phenylalanine
residue at amino acid position 508 ofthe putative product
of the cystic fibrosis gene. Extended haplotype data based
on DNA markers closely linked to the putative disease
gene locus suggest that the remainder of the cystic fibrosis

mutant gene pool consists of multiple, different mutations. A small set of these latter mutant alleles (about 8
percent) may confer residual pancreatic exocrine function
in a subgroup of patients who are pancreatic sufficient.
The ability to detect mutations in the cystic fibrosis gene
at the DNA level has important implications for genetic

heterozygote advantage (3), genetic drift (4), multiple loci (5), and
reproductive compensation (6), have been proposed in attempts to
explain the high incidence and, indirectly, the nature of the CF
mutations. Although some of these hypotheses could not be further
addressed because of the lack of knowledge about the basic defect in
CF, several important observations have been made during the past
few years through genetic analysis of the families of affected
individuals (7-20).
Extensive linkage analysis provides evidence for the existence of a
single CF locus on human chromosome 7 (region q31) (7-10, 21).
