Detection of more than 50 different CFTR mutations
in a large group of German cystic fibrosis patients

Received: 17 March 1994 / Revised 9 Mai 1994

A b s t r a c t We have conducted a comprehensive study of
the molecular basis of cystic fibrosis (CF) in 350 German
CF patients. A screening approach based on single-strand
conformation analysis and direct sequencing of genomic
polymerase chain reaction products has allowed us to detect the molecular defects on 95.4% of the CF chromosomes within the coding region and splice sites of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
gene. The spectrum of sequence changes comprises 54
different mutations, including 17 missense mutations, 14
nonsense mutations, 11 frameshift mutations, 10 splice
site variants and two amino acid deletions. Eleven of
these mutations have not previously been described. Our
results reflect the marked mutational heterogeneity of CF
in a large sample of patients from a non-isolated population.

Introduction
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common severe disorder of the
exocrine glands (reviewed by Boat et al. 1989). Major
clinical manifestations of the disease are exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and recurrent airway infections with opportunistic pathogens that ultimately lead to destruction of

lung tissue and right heart failure. Pancreatic status and
the risk of airway infection have both been shown to be
subject of a genetic predisposition (Santis et al. 1990;
Kristidis et al. 1992; Kubesch et al. 1993; The CF Genotype-Phenotype Consortium 1993), but a high variability
in the clinical progression of the disease can be seen even
among siblings within the same family (Santis et al.
1990). About 5 % - 1 0 % of the patients can be diagnosed at
birth by a meconium ileus. In most other cases, the clinical diagnosis is based on the observation of fatty bulky
stools, recurrent infections or failure to thrive and is generally confirmed by the measurement of elevated sweat
chloride concentrations.
CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The
frequency of the disease varies among ethnic groups and is
highest in populations of Caucasian descent, where about
1 in 2000 newborns are affected and 1 in 25 individuals are
thought to be heterozygous carriers. The gene responsible
for CF, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, has been localized on chromosome
7q31 and encompasses about 250 kb with 27 exons (Rommens et al. 1989; Zielenski et al. 1991 a). CFTR encodes a
transmembrane protein of 1480 amino acids that is mainly
expressed in epithelial cell types and that has been shown
to function as a low-conductance chloride channel regulated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation and by nucleoside triphosphates (Riordan et al. 1989; Anderson et al.
1991; Cheng et al. 1991; Bear et al. 1992). A single mutation in exon 10 of the CFTR gene, the 3-bp deletion AF508,
has been found on about 70% of Caucasian CF chromosomes (Kerem et al. 1989; Tsui 1992a). More recently, the
concerted action of several groups has revealed more than
300 other CFTR mutations and sequence variations in CF
patients worldwide (Tsui 1992 a, b).
In a few previous studies on Caucasian CF patients, the
analysis of a limited number of mutations has allowed a
detection rate of more than 95% (Ferec et al. 1992; Cheadle et al. 1993; Cuppens et al. 1993), which is frequently
regarded as a threshold for the initiation of large-scale
screening efforts in a particular population (Workshop on
Population Screening for the CF Gene 1990). In this

534
study, we have employed single-strand conformation
p o l y m o r p h i s m (SSCP) analysis for a rapid and sensitive
localization of C F T R mutations prior to direct sequencing
in a group of 350 G e r m a n CF patients. We detected and
identified 54 different C F T R mutations on 668 out of 700
CF chromosomes, corresponding to a detection rate of
95.4%. The spectrum of these mutations and their extragenic and intragenic restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotypes are presented below.

Materials and methods
Patients
Some 350 German CF families took part in this study. In order to
ascertain accurate frequency data for Caucasian chromosomes, patients were not included here whenever family anamnesis revealed
that one parent or grand-parent originated from a non-Caucasian
population, Patient and parental samples were contributed from the
pediatric centers in Hannover, Bonn, Esslingen, Essen, Bremen,
Giegen, Bad Sachsa, Osnabrtick and Kassel. The diagnosis of CF
was based on clinical observations and was confirmed by three
measurements of abnormally high sweat chloride concentrations.
Classification of a patient as pancreatic sufficient required normal
faecal fat excretion for at least three days. Whenever possible, KEDTA-blood samples were obtained from the patient and from the
parents. Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral lymphocytes as previously described (Gross-Bellard et al. 1973).
Polymerase chain reaction amplification
and direct mutation analysis
The 27 exons of the CFTR gene together with their flanking intron
regions were amplified as before (Zielenski et al. 1991 a) with the
exception of exons 1, 14b, 17a and 24. For the latter four exons,
we used different primers, viz. 5"-GGT CTT TGG CAT TAG
GAG CTT G -3" (li-5), 5"-CTC ACC CAA CTA ATG GTC ATC3" (14bi-3), 5"-ATC ACT GAC ACA CTT TGT CCA CT-3"
(17ai-5), 5"-AGT AGA TTA ACA ATA AAG AAT CTC-3"
(17ai-3) and 5"-TCC ATG AGG TGA CTG TCC C-3" (24i-3).
Screening for the AF508 mutation was performed by heteroduplex
analysis in 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)
(Rommens et al. 1990). Haplotype analysis and direct testing of
further common CFTR mutations were carried out as published
elsewhere (D~Srket al. 1992a). The intron mutations 3849 + 10 kB
C-+T and 1811 + 1.6 kB A--+G were separately screened according to the instructions of W. E. Highsmith jr. et al. and M. Chillon
et al. (personal communications to the Cystic Fibrosis Genetic
Analysis Consortium).
SSCP analysis
Approximately 0.5 btg genomic DNA was included as the template
in a 50-btl polymerase chain reaction (PCR) containing 20 btM
dNTPs, 0.5 gM of each oligodeoxynucleotide primer, 50 mM KCI,
1.5 mM MgC12, 10 mM TRIS/HCI pH 8.0, 1.5 U Taq DNA polymerase. After 20 PCR cycles had been performed, a 20-1al aliquot
was transferred into a fresh tube containing 1 btl 20 gM dCTP,
dGTP, dTTP and I laCi o~-33p-dATP(Amersham Buchler). Fifteen
additional PCR cycles were then performed in parallel with both
tubes, and the unlabeled PCR product was run on an agarose gel as
a control. In order to obtain DNA fragments with a favourable
length of 100-300 nucleotides, the labeled PCR product was digested with an appropriate restriction enzyme (New England BioLabs) prior to SSCP analysis. At least two different digests were
performed for each analysed region; the most frequently used enzymes were Hinfl (for exons 2, 3, 4, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14a, 15 and 24),

DdeI (exons 6b, 7, 11, 13, 16, 18 and 19), Rsal (exons 2, 9, 14a,
15, 17b and 18), HphI (exons 1, 11, 12, 20 and 23) and ScrFI (exons 6a, 14b, 16 and 22). The digested PCR product was mixed
with an equal amount of loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mM
EDTA, 0.05% bromophenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF), denatured at 95~ for 3 min and immediately chilled on ice. The samples were then loaded onto a precooled 40-cm polyacrylamide
wedge gel consisting of 5% acrylamide, 1 x TBE (0.09 M TRISborate, 0.002 M EDTA, pH 8.3), 5% glycerol. Electrophoresis was
run at 25 W, at 10~ for 5 h. The gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid
for 40 min, dried and exposed overnight.

Sequence analysis
Symmetric PCR products were purified by ultrafiltration through
Centricon-100 tubes (Amicon, Beverly, Mass.). One of the two
strands was then selectively amplified from 1/5 of the purified retentate by 15 cycles of asymmetric PCR including only one
primer. Asymmetric PCR products were again purified by ultrafiltration and were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using Sequenase 2.0 DNA polymerase according to
the manufacturer's instruction (USB/Amersham).

Results
Mutation screening
We used a cascade screening approach for the rapid analysis of C F T R mutations in 350 G e r m a n patients. The most
frequent C F mutation AF508 was first tested by a heteroduplex assay in 12% PAGE ( R o m m e n s et al. 1990). A few
other mutations k n o w n to be frequent (e.g. N I 3 0 3 K ,
R553X, G542X, G551D, 2789+5 G - + A and 3849+10 kB
C--+T) were then screened by specific direct methods as
previously described (D6rk et al. 1992 a). Since after this
pre-screening, about 35% of samples carried at least one
unidentified mutation, we employed SSCP analysis (Orita
et al. 1989) for the detection of u n k n o w n sequence variants. This simple rapid screening method is based on the
observation that single-stranded D N A molecules differing
by as little as one single base substitution may form different conformers and migrate differently in a n o n - d e n a turing polyacrylamide gel (Orita et al. 1989). To achieve a
favourable fragment length of 1 5 0 - 3 0 0 bp, labelled PCR
products were digested at internal restriction sites. Generally, two different restriction digests, yielding fragments
with overlapping sequences, were separately e x a m i n e d
under identical electrophoresis conditions. Figure 1 illustrates some results for single nucleotide substitutions in
four different regions of the C F T R gene. In agreement
with previous reports on the sensitivity of SSCP analysis
(Sheffield et al. 1993; Hayashi and Yandell 1993; Glavac
and Dean 1993), we could reliably detect, from at least
one of the two digests, 98 sequence changes (92%) in 106
characterized control samples carrying different mutations and sequence variants througout the C F T R gene.
Each mutation detected by the aberrant migration of PCR
products was subsequently confirmed and identified by
direct sequencing. In the case of novel missense or splice
site mutations, a panel of 100 normal chromosomes from
unaffected members of CF families was screened for the

Identification of new mutations
During the course of this work, several mutations and sequence variations were found that have not previously been
reported and are briefly described below. Following the recommended nomenclature for mutations (Beaudet and Tsui
1993), amino acids are designated by the single-letter code
(with "X" for a termination codon), and nucleotides are numbered according to the cDNA sequence (Riordan et al. 1989).
Four novel nonsense mutations have been uncovered
in single German CF families. (1) R 7 5 X is a C - + T transition at nucleotide 355 leading to the termination mutation
R 7 5 X (Fig. 2). It was identified in a 9-year-old patient.
This mutation occurs at a C p G dinucleotide within exon 3
where a benign missense variant (R75Q) has previously
been described (Zielenski et al. 1991 b). The pancreas-insufficient patient inherited R 7 5 X from his father and the
mutation N 1 3 0 3 K (Osborne et al. 1991) from his mother.
The R75X nonsense mutation is associated with a rare sequence variant 125 G---~C (Cutting et al. 1992) in the promoter region o f the C F T R gene. It creates a recognition
site for HphI. (2) G 6 7 3 X is a nonsense mutation found in

exon 13 of the C F T R gene. The G--+T transversion at nucleotide position 2149 (Fig.3) creates a recognition site
for MslI. G 6 7 3 X was present in a 25-year-old female who
is c o m p o u n d heterozygous for AI507 (Kerem et al. 1990)
and G673X; she is pancreatic insufficient. (3) L 7 1 9 X was
detected in a 4-year-old female who is c o m p o u n d heterozygous for AF508 and L719X. This patient was also
pancreatic insufficient and had b e c o m e colonized with
Pseudomonas aeruginosa during infancy. (4) The L 1 0 5 9 X
mutation represents a novel T---~G transversion within
exon 17b where it abolishes a recognition site for HindIII.

This mutation was identified in a 20-year-old female patient who is compound heterozygous for the two nonsense
mutations R553X (Cutting et al. 1990) and L1059X. The
patient who was diagnosed by pathological sweat tests at
the late age of 10 years now presents moderate pancreatic
insufficiency and is colonized with P aeruginosa.
Three new frameshift mutations were identified, two of
which were located within a stretch of seven consecutive
adenine residues ranging from nucleotides 2178 to 2184 in
exon 13; the third lies within exon 16. (1) The insertion
2184insA (Fig.4) has been detected in four unrelated CF
families. Whereas one heterozygote R117C/2184insA presents with borderline disease (see below), three compound
heterozygotes AF508/2184insA are pancreatic insufficient
with severe forms of CF. We thus classify 2184insA as the
"pancreas-insufficient" and R117C as the "pancreas-sufficient" allele. (2) The deletion 2184delA (Fig.4) was detected in two unrelated German patients both of whom are
pancreatic insufficient and compound heterozygous for
AF508 and 2184delA. This mutation has independently
been found in French CF patients (Chevalier-Porst et al.
1994). Furthermore, a different mutation at this apparent
hotspot of frameshift, the previously reported complex
mutation 2183AA---~G (Bozon et al. 1994) could be confirmed in a further four German CF families. Although
2184delA and 2183AA---~G differ from each other only by
the presence or absence of an additional A---~G substitution, they probably have evolved independently, as both
mutations are associated with different haplotypes (Table 1).
(3) The frameshift insertion 3100insA was identified within exon 16 in a severely affected pancreatic-insufficient
patient who carries AF508 on his other allele. Interestingly, the seven nucleotide sequence immediately preceding the 3100insA mutation is identical to the sequence preceding another adenine insertion, the previously published
mutation 435insA in exon 4 of the CFTR gene (K~ilin et al.
1992b).
Four novel amino acid substitutions have been identified in the two putative transmembrane domains, the regulatory domain and the second nucleotide-binding domain
of CFTR. (1) In the first transmembrane domain, the mutation R117C was initially identified in a 12-year-old pancreatic sufficient German CF patient. This mutation occurs at the same CpG dinucleotide as the previously described and extensively characterized mutation R l l 7 H
(Dean et al. 1990; Kiesewetter et al. 1993; Sheppard et al.

(Fig. 5). R l l 7 C can be distinguished from R l l 7 H by the
SSCP pattern and also by restriction enzyme analysis as it
creates a recognition site for BsmI. In the single affected
German family, the child with CF carries R l l 7 C on his
paternal chromosome and the frameshift mutation
2184insA (see above) on his maternal chromosome. Despite clearly pathological sweat chloride concentrations,
the clinical course of the obese patient has been almost
asymptomatic so far and has not required CF-specific
treatment. A similar mild disease was observed for single
Scandinavian R l l 7 C patients (M. Schwartz, personal
communication; Shackleton et al. 1992). (2) In a single
pancreatic-insufficient patient, we identified the missense
variant L619S within exon 13 (Fig.6). The predicted
amino acid substitution occurs in a portion of the regulatory domain of CFTR; this region is conserved between

human, mouse, bovine and Xenopus C F T R (Tucker et al.
1992). As the L619S change was present in conjunction
with the previously known rare sequence variant 1716
G--->A (Kerem et al. 1990) on the same allele, it was difficult to decide whether both sequence changes were required to cause the disease. However, whereas the 1716
G---~A was also seen on a non-CF chromosome, the L619S
substitution was only detected in this single family. (3)
Three unrelated CF patients with severe lung disease but
moderately impaired pancreatic function were found to be
heterozygous for the novel missense mutation I I 0 0 5 R
(Fig. 7). Two patients were found to be heterozygous for
AF508/I1005R; the third carried N 1 3 0 3 K on the other allele. The T---~G transversion in exon 17a could be tested
by restriction e n z y m e analysis as it creates a recognition
site for MaeI and abolishes a SfcI site. The predicted arginine for isoleucine substitution introduces a unique positive charge into a stretch of hydrophobic amino acid residues within the second transmembrane domain (Riordan
et al. 1989). (4) The mutation Q 1 2 9 1 R affects the last
codon of exon 20, within the C F T R region coding for the
second nucleotide-binding domain. This substitution was
found in a pancreas-insufficient patient carrying AF508
on his other chromosome. The predicted amino acid substitution Q1291R might be located within the centre re-

gion of the conserved "ATP-binding cassette" (Riordan et
al. 1989) and thus may impair the regulation of CFTR. Alternatively, it could affect the correct splicing of exon 20
in a similar way as described for the Q1291H mutation in
the same codon (Jones et al. 1992).
In addition to several previously known dimorphisms,
we have identified two frequent polymorphisms in introns
15 and 21 and one rare sequence variant within the coding
region of the exon 17b. (1) The G--cA transition at nucleotide 3041-92 (intron 15) is present on alleles with the
dimorphic marker haplotype 3 or 7 (Table 1 appendix)
and is found on about 25% of German non-AF508 chromosomes. Because of its convenient detection, this NsiI
R F L P (briefly termed "TUB I5") has proved to be useful
as an additional tool for intragenic dimorphic marker haplotype determination (D6rk et al. 1992a). (2) During
SSCP analysis of exon 22 PCR products, subtle migration
differences in a number of samples were caused by a
4096-283T/C polymorphism in intron 21, which is located 19 nucleotides downstream of the c o m m o n l y used
PCR primer 22i-5 (Zielenski et al. 1991 a). This SSCP
again appeared to be associated with haplotype 3 in the
analysed non-AF508 CF samples, but no efforts were
made to determine more thoroughly the allele frequencies
on normal chromosomes. (3) The neutral sequence variant
at codon T1095 in exon 17b, 3417 A---)T, was detected
only once, in a single German CF family with as yet unknown C F T R mutations.

Frequencies and distribution of C F T R mutations
The combined approach o f direct mutation analysis, single-strand conformation analysis and direct sequencing
led us to detect 54 different C F T R mutations in the 700
CF chromosomes under investigation. AF508, by far the
most frequent mutation in Germany, was found on 72% of
CF chromosomes. There are, however, only six additional
C F T R mutations with a frequency of approximately 1%
or more of the CF chromosomes; two nonsense mutations,
G542X and R553X, and the missense mutations G551D
and N I 3 0 3 K were predominantly seen in severely affected patients, whereas the transmembrane missense mutation R347P and the splice mutation 3849 + 10 kB C---~T

were the most frequent in pancreas-sufficient patients.
Some 47 different mutations were present at a lower frequency in the investigated panel; most of them could only
be confirmed as single cases. When compared with other
recent studies from the neighbouring countries of Belgium (Cuppens et al. 1993; Mercier et al. 1993) and
France (Fanen et al. 1992; Ferec et al. 1992; Claustres et
al. 1993), 8-17 mutations are in common between our
study panel and these populations. This subset of frequent
mutations accounts for 90% of CF alleles in our study
group. The frequency distribution of all identified mutations and their associated haplotypes are compiled in
Table 1. A few of these mutations are found on alleles carrying additional rare sequence variants that are listed in
Table 2. After the completion of our SSCP screening,
4.6% of the CF alleles remain undefined. Haplotype
analysis of these chromosomes suggests the presence of at
least five further hidden CFTR mutations. Twenty patients
who are compound heterozygous for one known and one
still undefined, CFTR mutation suffer from moderate to
severe forms of CF. Five of the six patients in which both
mutations are unknown are however almost asymptomatic,
despite consistently elevated sweat chloride concentrations. Further clinical and genetic analyses are required to
examine the molecular basis for the borderline disease observed in this patient subgroup.

Discussion
We present the results of an extensive analysis of the 27
exons and the flanking intron sequences of the CFTR
gene in 700 German CF chromosomes. SSCP analysis
followed by direct sequencing of aberrantly migrating
samples has allowed us to identify more than 50 different
CFTR mutations accounting for 95.4% of the CF alleles
under investigation. These results support the nature of
CF as a monogenic disease and demonstrate the usefulness of the SSCP technique for rapid sensitive mutation
screening. The small number of unidentified alleles may
have escaped detection because of technical limitations of
SSCP analysis for a particular sequence or could reflect
mutations outside the investigated regions of the CFTR
gene, e.g. intron mutations, promoter mutations or large
genomic deletions. Many different studies have previously indicated that CF mutations are distributed over the
whole CFTR gene (Fanen et al. 1992; Ferec et al. 1992;
Tsui 1992a, b; Cheadle et al. 1993; Claustres et al. 1993;
Cuppens et al. 1993), The mutations in our panel affected
20 of the 27 CFTR exons with only a few apparent clusters. Mutational hotspots for single nucleotide changes
can be noted at CpG dinucleotides, such as in codons 117
or 553, and a hotspot of frameshift mutations is represented by the oligomeric stretch of seven consecutive
adenines in exon 13. Increased mutability of these particular sequences is demonstrated not only by the occurrence
of different mutations at the same codon, but also by the
presence of the mutations R553X and 2184insA in two incompatible dimorphic marker haplotypes; this suggests

recurrent mutational events. With regard to CFTR function, missense mutations are significantly more frequent
in the nucleotide-binding domains or the predicted transmembrane helices, whereas the large exon 13, coding for
the unique regulatory domain of CFFR, mainly harbours
nonsense and frameshift mutations. It has been proposed
(Tsui 1992a; Claustres et al. 1993) that this asymmetric
distribution reflects the high sensitivity of chloride-channel-forming and ATP-binding regions in the CFTR protein to changes in charge and structure, in contrast to the
more degenerate cAMP-mediated regulation through
phosphorylation of multiple sites in the R-domain (Cheng
et al. 1991). Interestingly, all six missense mutations in
the first transmembrane domain of CFTR are associated
with pancreatic sufficiency in our study group, consistent
with the view that this type of mutations modulates hut
does not abolish the conductance properties of the ion
channel (Tsui 1992a; Sheppard et al. 1993; Tabcharani et
al. 1993). A major caveat in such interpretations is that the
disease-causing character of many CFTR missense mutations has not yet been established. Whereas the effects of
several splice, nonsense or frameshift mutations have
been thoroughly analysed (e.g. Jones et al. 1992; D6rk et
al. 1993c, 1994b; Will et al. 1994; and references therein), there clearly remains a need for future investigations
into the consequences of rare missense mutations on
CFTR processing and function in vivo. Nevertheless, in
the absence of detailed knowledge about CFTR structure
and substrates, mutational and clinical data on missense
mutations aid the elucidation of the vulnerable sites of
functional importance in the CFTR protein.
The identification of CFTR mutations in most of the
investigated German CF chromosomes allows for more
accurate genetic diagnosis and counselling in the affected
families, facilities that accompany the improvement of
carrier diagnosis by microsatellite typing (Morral et al.
1991; Zielenski et al. 1991 c). However, the large number
of different mutations in an extensive group of patients
also has implications for any large-scale screening efforts
in a mixed population. At present, screening programmes
for families with no history of CF are controversial with
respect to their ethical and social consequences (Wilfond
and Fost 1990; Fost 1992), and different conclusions may
be drawn in different countries. Should populations wish
to be tested, it has been recommended that screening
should provide a better than 95% detection rate to give at
least the same certainty to the counselled couples as to
any unscreened couples (Workshop on Population Screening for the CF Gene 1990). Detection rates ranging from
88% to 99.5% have meanwhile been achieved for some
Caucasian populations (Fanen et al. 1992; Ferec et al.
1992; Super and Schwarz 1992; Cheadle et al. 1993;
Claustres et al. 1993; Cuppens et al. 1993; Mercier et al.
1993), mostly after the identification of fewer than 30 different mutations in samples consisting of 100-200 CF patients. However, the number of mutations to be uncovered
for an appropriate detection rate appears to depend on
both the investigated population and the sample size. In
this study of 350 German CF patients, we had to identify

540
more than fifty different mutations in several different regions o f the C F T R gene to surpass the proposed threshold
(see above) at which where population-based screening
theoretically can be offered. A further nine C F T R mutations have been detected in G e r m a n patients o f non-Caucasian descent (K~ilin et al, 1992b; D6rk et al. 1993a;
N un es et al. 1993; unpublished data) but they have not
been included in our survey. T h e low frequencies of c o m mon m o l e c u l a r defects, the large n u m b e r of " p r i v a t e " mutations, ethnic h et e r o g e n e it y (as discussed by Ober et al.
1992) and an increasing n u m b e r o f case reports with c o m plex alleles (D6rk et al. 1991; K~ilin et al. 1992a; Cu p p en s
et al. 1993; K i e s e w e t t e r et al. 1993) could thus significantly i m p e d e large-scale screening. Therefore, it cannot
be anticipated from the results o f this study that the direct
analysis o f a subset o f mutations, even if sampled by multiplex assays, wo u l d presently be able to provide thorough
screening at low cost in a large non-isolated population.
