The histamine-liberating properties of a synthetic polypeptide (an a synthetic polypeptide (an alkylprolyl derivative of beta1-19-corticotrophin) were investigated under a variety of experimental conditions. It was found to be more potent in this respect than Compound 48/80, Melittin and Triton X-100. The degree of cell destruction observed in conjunction with the release of histamine induced by C 44 680-Ba suggests that the mode of action of the substance more closely resembles that of Compound 48/80 than that of Triton.
