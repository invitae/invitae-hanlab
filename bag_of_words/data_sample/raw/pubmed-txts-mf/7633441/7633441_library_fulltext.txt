INTRODUCTION
Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), or congenital aganglionic megacolon, is associated with the lack of intrinsic ganglion cells in
the myenteric and submucosal plexuses along variable lengths
of the gastrointestinal tract (I). As enteric ganglion cells are
derived primarily from the vagal neural crest, HSCR, like
other disorders whose affected tissues are of neural crest
origin, represents a typical neurocristopathy (2). With an
incidence of approximately 1 in 5000 live births, HSCR
represents the most common form of congenital bowel obstruction (3). Evidence for a genetic predisposition to HSCR
has mounted in the last three decades, beginning with the
identification of pedigrees that appear to segregate HSCR as
an incompletely penetrant autosomal dominant trait (4,5),
followed by formal segregation analysis yielding results consistent with single gene inheritance in at least 20% of cases
(6). Subsequently, linkage to the pericentromeric region of
chromosome 10 in a subset of families, and to chromosome
13q22 in a large Mennonite kindred (7-9), has been demonstrated.

More recently, mutations in HSCR patients have been
described in the RET receptor tyrosine kinase (10,11) and in
the G-protein coupled endothelin-B receptor (EDNRB; 12).
RET mutations have been described in both HSCR patients
and in patients with the autosomal dominant neuroendocrine
tumor phenotypes multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A
(MEN2A; 13-15), type 2B (MEN2B; 16-18) and isolated
medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC; 13,15,17,18). MEN2A
consists of MTC, pheochromocytoma and parathyroid hyperplasia, while MEN2B includes the manifestations of MEN2A
(except hyperparathyroidism) plus mucosal neuromas, ganglioneuromas, comeal nerve thickening and skeletal anomalies.
Familial and sporadic cases of isolated MTC are also part of
this spectrum of phenotypes (19-21). While the overwhelming
majority of MEN2A and MEN2B mutations reported to date
have been clustered in cysteine residues near the transmembrane domain of RET (MEN2A; e.g. 15) or in codon 918 in
the tyrosine kinase domain of RET (MEN2B; e.g. 18), no
clustering is evident among RET mutations reported in HSCR

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), or congenital aganglionic megacolon, is the most common cause of congenital
bowel obstruction with an incidence of 1 in 5000 live births. Recently, linkage of an incompletely penetrant,
dominant form of HSCR was reported, followed by Identification of mutations In the RET receptor tyrosine
kinase. To determine the frequency of RET mutations In HSCR and correlate genotype with phenotype, we
have screened for mutations among 80 HSCR probands representing a wide range of phenotypes and family
structures. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis
of RETs 20 exons for mutations among probands revealed eight putative mutations (10%). Sequence changes,
which Included missense, frameshift and complex mutations, were detected in both familial and Isolated
cases, among patients with both long- and short-segment HSCR and in three kindreds with other phenotypes
(maternal deafness, talipes and malrotation of the gut, respectively). Two mutations (C609Y and C620R) we
identified have previously been associated with multiple endocrine neoplasla type 2A (MEN2A), medullary
thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and, on rare occasions, HSCR. Thus, while HSCR family members may be at risk
for developing neuroendocrlne tumors, it follows that identical mutations in RET may be able to participate
in the pathogenesis of distinct phenotypes. Our data suggest that: (i) the overall frequency of RET mutations
in HSCR patients Is low and therefore, other genetic and/or environmental determinants contribute to the
majority of HSCR susceptibility, and (ii) at present, there is no obvious relationship between RET genotype
and HSCR phenotype.

patients. Recently, overlap between HSCR and MEN2
mutations was reported in a small number of patients (22-25),
although the two phenotypes have been known to co-occur
only in rare instances (23,26). In this report, we present two
independent cases of RET mutations that have previously
been reported primarily in association with MEN2A alone
(14,15,27), although one has been observed in three kindreds
with HSCR and either MEN2A or familial MTC (FMTC; 23).
Both missense changes affect cysteine residues in patients that,
at present, have HSCR only and imply that determining
genotype-phenotype correlations and penetrance for RETassociated neurocristopathies is not straightforward. We
describe additional non-polymorphic RET sequence changes
that were detected in six other HSCR patients and include a
change in the 5' untranslated region (UTR), missense changes,
a single base pair deletion and a complex rearrangement in
exon 9.

RESULTS
We studied 80 patients with Hirschsprung disease (Table 1)
and, of these, eight (10%) were found to harbor sequence
changes not found in at least 96 control individuals (192

chromosomes). Both the nature and location of the mutations
varied widely, with the eight alterations distributed over six
exons and consisting of missense, frameshift and complex
mutations. Putative mutations are summarized in Table. 2.
They include five transitions (1 C->T, 3 G->A, 1 T->C), 1
transversion (C—»G), 1 single base pair deletion and an apparent
duplication/insertion/deletion that results in a net insertion of
22 base pairs. Mutations were observed in three short-segment
cases, one documented long-segment case, one case of total
colonic aganglionosis and three cases where segment length
information was incomplete or not available. All sequence
changes were contained within the amino acid coding region
with the exception of that seen in family 102, in which a
single base change in the 5' untranslated region relatively
close to the initiator codon in exon 1 was observed. The
locations of mutations with respect to the known functional
domains of the RET protein are shown in Figure 1.
Among the mutations presented in Table 2 are two sequence
variants in exon 1. The C=>G change observed in family 102
is a familial mutation that occurs 27 bases upstream from the
ATG start site in the 5' untranslated region (UTR). As this
base substitution occurs 3' to the putative promoter region but
5' to the signal peptide (28), it is not clear if and how it might

affect RET gene regulation and/or expression. While the
patient's mother harboring the mutation does not have HSCR,
she does have sensorineural deafness, a relatively common
manifestation among neurocristopathies in general (2) and
HSCR in particular (6,12). This change creates a Taq\ restriction
site not present in 96 controls (data not shown). The proband
in family 78 inherited a Pro=>Leu mutation at amino acid
position 20 that eliminates a MspA\ I restriction site (data
not shown).
In the pedigree of family 32 (Fig. 2), both children have
total colonic aganglionosis, the father is phenotypically normal
and the mother suffers from chronic severe constipation (CSC).
Detection of an SSCP in individual 3203 and direct sequence
analysis of this patient revealed a G=>A transition that changes
a glycine to a serine residue at amino acid 93 (G93S; Fig. 3);
the mutation was found to eliminate a BsrF I restriction site.
Subsequent restriction enzyme digests of all family members
with BsrF I demonstrated that the mutation was of paternal
origin and not from the mother with CSC (Fig. 2). Figure 2
also presents SSCP patterns in the two children that are distinct
from each of the two parents, while the parents' patterns are
distinct from each other. Sequence analyses of all four family
members demonstrated that while the unaffected father transmitted the mutation, the mother was found to be heterozygous
for a silent Eagl polymorphism in the same exon, at alanine
45 (29), which also occurred in her sons (data not shown).
Direct sequencing results for the mutation in individual 3203
are presented in Figure 3.

than 16 nucleotides. A similarity search using the Geneworks
2.3.1 software package (Intelligenetics, Inc., Mountain View,
CA) detected no significant homology between the 16 orphan
nucleotides and sequences in the GenBank and EMBL
databases.
We identified two independent cases where HSCR patients
were found to carry exon 10 mutations that affect cysteine
residues. Both of these mutations, C609Y and C620R, have
previously been reported in MEN2A patients (e.g. reference
15). The pedigree and SSCP analysis for an affected sib pair
(family 88) are presented in Figure 5. Restriction digests with
BspM 1 and Bstl) I (30) confirmed SSCP and direct sequencing
results for the C609Y and C620R mutations in families 88
and 30, respectively (data not shown). The two affected sibs
in family 88 were found to have received the C609Y mutation
from their father. As of March 1995, the father is 59 years old
and has not exhibited any signs of neuroendocrine neoplasia.
However, he has not undergone a pentagastrin test and therefore, especially as a high proportion of gene carriers are still
asymptomatic at age 70 in the absence of biochemical screening
(31), he must be considered to be at-risk for MEN2A/MTC.
This family is currently being offered genetic counseling.
Individual 3003 (family 30) is an isolated case of HSCR and
carries a new mutation in the RET gene (C620R).
To our knowledge, none of the non-exon 10 mutations
in HSCR-only kindreds described here have been observed
previously, with the exception of R33OQ (10). Additionally,
one sequence change was found that was not reported previously (29) and is not considered to be causative of HSCR. It
is a silent, private change (TAC=>TAT) in codon 314 (tyrosine).

(Hofstra el al, in preparation). This substitution of a neutral
polar residue for a basic one occurred near the end of the
second tyrosine kinase domain close to the C-terminus of the
protein. Three of the four cases in which this change was
found were long-segment and all four were from multiplex
families (families 92, 130, 131 and 150; Table 1). The

possibility that this change could modulate the HSCR phenotype is presented in the Discussion.

DISCUSSION

Failure to include families with long segment disease and/
or multiple affected members is probably not associated with
a low rate of mutation detection. Segregation analysis has
established that long segment forms of HSCR are more likely
to be explained by a locus that behaves in an autosomal
dominant fashion (6). Of the 45 families where segment length
information was available, 29 (64%) were considered long
segment. Similarly, the proportion of multicase families
included in the sample may be expected to affect the mutation
detection rate, as such families are, presumably, more likely
to carry germline mutations (Table 1), although not necessarily
in RET (12). Of the 80 probands, 36 (45%) came from kindreds
containing multiple affected members. Of the eight mutations
detected, four came from the 36 multicase families (11%),
while four came from the 44 single case families (9%); this
difference is not statistically significant. Although the total
number of mutations found is relatively small, neither phenotypic nor family categories for mutation screening appear to
have impacted detection rates. What is more striking is that
for all phenotypes and family types, mutation detection does
not exceed 20%. This suggests that carrying a RET mutation
may, in fact, bear little relationship to disease phenotype/
family type on its own and that these and other variables (e.g.
penetrance) are more dependent upon genotypes at other loci
and/or environmental determinants. A recent comprehensive

Spectrum of RET mutations, polymorphisms and associated
phenotypes
Table 1 confirms both the phenotypic and intra-allelic heterogeneity of HSCR cases that carry RET mutations. Mutations
were found in at least one short-segment case, two longsegment cases, and one instance of total colonic aganglionosis.
Additionally, the nature of RET mutations ranged from presumably conservative amino acid substitutions (e.g. Gly=>Ser is
generally considered conservative as it represents the exchange
of one neutral polar amino acid for another, although Gly is
unique in that it is the only amino acid small enough to
accommodate many tight turns in proteins) to complex
rearrangements such as that observed in family 84 (Fig. 4).
Although the R982C substitution is not thought to be causative
of disease in and of itself, it may influence the phenotype,
especially given the multigenic nature of HSCR (12); among
patients in which it was found, three of the four cases
were long-segment and all four were from multiplex families
(families 92, 130, 131 and 150; Table 1). It has also been
detected in four of 120 (3.3%) neuroblastomas, in at least two
of the accompanying constitutional DNA samples and in an
MTC-derived cell line (Hofstra et al, in preparation). A recent
report found it in three of 142 control chromosomes (2.1%)
and in one of five HSCR kindreds with exon 10 mutations
(23). Thus, the possibility remains that this polymorphic allele
increases the risk for HSCR.
While the results presented here have several important
implications for the genetic basis of the HSCR phenotype, its
penetrance, and its association with neuroendocrine tumor
syndromes, for those patients with mutations in cysteine codons
there are potential clinical ramifications as well. Given that all
MEN 2A mutations described to date occur in one of five
cysteine residues in exons 10 and 11 of RET, and that mutations
have only recently been reported in HSCR patients (23,24),
one possibility is that these patients are at risk for MEN2. In
light of the wide range in age-at-onset for these tumors,
such risk cannot be discounted (31,35). Moreover, variable
expressivity and non-penetrance on the order of 30% may
further obscure these individuals' status vis-a-vis MEN2A
(31). It is important to note that in both instances reported here,
the parental generation was phenotypically normal, although
individual 8801 (Fig. 5) also carries the mutation. Neither
family has undergone biochemical screening for C-cell hyperplasia. Such screening may now be warranted in view of the
presence of the MEN2A-associated mutations, however, it
should be recognized that the calcitonin test carries a false
positive rate of 5-10% (36). Whether mutations of cysteine
residues in exons 10 and 11 lead to no detectable phenotype,
HSCR, MEN2A, or a combination of MEN2A and HSCR,
may well depend on the presence of additional genes.
The mutation segregating in family 84 is of interest because
it represents, to our knowledge, the first report of a complex
rearrangement (deletions notwithstanding) of the RET gene
associated with HSCR. Although the insertion appears to have

Mutation detection and frequency of RET mutations
RET mutations were detected in eight of 80 (10%) HSCR
probands. This frequency is somewhat lower than other reports
of mutations ranging from approximately 25 to 38% of patients
(10,11,24), assuming that mutations are equally likely to occur
in all exons. There are several possible explanations for the
relatively low rate of detection presented here. First, SSCP
may have failed to detect a larger number of extant mutations.
Although detection rate estimates for this technique have
ranged from 35 to 100% (32), a recent study evaluating the
PhastSystemTM apparatus and SSCP protocols used in this
study estimates that it can detect >90% of mutations (33).
Thus, we consider it unlikely that SSCP failed to detect more
than a few mutations in the coding region. Nevertheless,
alternative mutation detection methods are being explored in
order to answer this question. Second, the selection of probands
may have been a contributing factor. Probands in this study
were chosen from a larger collection in order to represent as
wide a range of phenotypes as is observed in HSCR patients
(Table 1). Thus, our screening panel included 24 (30%) families
with other anomalies (present in either the proband or firstdegree relatives) in addition to HSCR. Of the eight patients
in whom mutations were found (Table 2), two had non-HSCRrelated phenotypes and these were either relatively minor
(talipes) or not even present in the patient himself (maternal
deafness). Thus, RET mutations may be restricted, in most
cases, to patients with HSCR and/or neuroendocrine phenotypes. Additionally, one proband had surgery for a malrotation
of the gut shortly after birth (he underwent surgery for HSCR
a year later). The relationship of these two phenotypes is not
understood.

study (34) which employed SSCP, Southern blotting and
fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses, still reported RET
mutations in less than 20% of HSCR patients, thereby supporting the existence of other genetic, environmental and/or
stochastic factors.

Questions about RET's role in the pathogenesis of human
HSCR
Although at least one initial report of RET mutations in HSCR
patients implied that RET was the major locus responsible for
HSCR (11), exactly what role RET plays in the pathogenesis
of the disease remains unclear. As the vast majority of patients
screened thus far do not appear to carry RET mutations
(10,11,34, present study), it is almost certain that perturbation
of biochemical pathways upstream, downstream or unrelated
to RET can predispose to HSCR. As we have recently demonstrated, one such pathway involves the endothelin-B receptor
(ETB), a G-protein coupled receptor, the gene for which maps
to human chromosome 13q22 and has been shown to be
mutated in a large Mennonite kindred segregating HSCR
(12,42). Efforts are underway to establish the frequency of
mutations in this gene, its ligand (endothelin-3 or EDN3; 43),
and their concomitant proteases, in non-Mennonite HSCR
cases.
The notion that RET has the capacity to cause HSCR by
itself is further challenged by other data presented here;
namely, the occurrence of mutations causally associated with

MEN2/MTC in HSCR-only patients. The notion that MEN2A/
MTC-associated mutations must somehow activate c-ret is
supported by cellular transfection assays that have shown at
least one MEN2A mutation to result in constitutive dimerization of the receptor (44). Conversely, HSCR has been said to
arise as a result of an abrogation of c-ret protein function
(10,35,45,46). Data derived from mice homozygous for a null
mutation at the RET locus support this view, as they exhibit
total intestinal aganglionosis but do not develop tumors (47).
Moreover, multiple independent cases of HSCR heterozygous
for deletions of proximal chromosome lOq have been reported
(34, reviewed in 48), implying that haploinsufficiency for RET
is critical in the development of disease. However, if, as our
data and others' (23) suggest, the same mutation can give rise
to non-overlapping phenotypes, it may be difficult to reconcile
the 'activation' (MEN2/MTC) versus 'abrogation' (HSCR)
models.
When postulating a model for RET-Ymked HSCR, it may be
helpful to consider recent results obtained by our group in
identifying a second locus for HSCR (HSCR2; 9,12). Among
the Mennonite kindred segregating HSCR, there is a strong
positive correlation between phenotype and EDNRB genotype;
however, the phenotype clearly deviates from simple mendelian
expectations. This is exemplified most profoundly by the
existence of HSCR patients who are homozygous normal at
the EDNRB locus. Moreover, the same pedigree includes
individuals who do not have HSCR yet are genotypically
homozygous for the W276C mutation at the EDNRB locus
(incomplete penetrance). Thus, although this region of chromosome 13 is linked to HSCR on the basis of strong linkage
disequilibrium (9), the EDNRB mutation itself is neither fully
dominant nor fully recessive, and, neither necessary nor
sufficient to cause HSCR. In addition to a small region of
chromosome 21 and the RET locus itself, it is expected that
at least one other locus remains to be found that is also
important to the expression of the HSCR phenotype (9,12).
Analogously, the data presented here (e.g. mutations usually
associated with another disease; phenotypic effects of conservative amino acid substitutions indistinguishable from those
of complex rearrangements) imply that the penetrance and
expressivity of RET mutations in HSCR (HSCR1) are attributable not only to a patient's genotype at RET, but at other loci
as well, and perhaps to environmental determinants.
Future analyses of novel Hirschsprung disease loci and
continuing studies of HSCR patients should take into account
genotypes and/or haplotypes at all other known loci/candidate
regions, given what is now known about the genetic attributes
of the disease, namely that: (i) HSCR is multigenic in nature;
(ii) HSCR mutations at the RET locus exhibit allelic heterogeneity; (iii) identical mutations can exhibit pleiotropic and,
paradoxically, sometimes non-overlapping manifestations in
different individuals; (iv) there are clear phenotypic distinctions
between homozygous mutant RET mice and human HSCR
patients (47); and (v) thus far, there has been a failure to detect
RET mutations in a majority of HSCR patients. Thus, although
it is of great biological importance, it is difficult to conceive
of RET as a completely necessary, let alone sufficient, determinant of susceptibility to HSCR. It is expected that future
identification of additional mutations, interacting proteins and
other predisposing loci will further our understanding of this
enigmatic genetic phenomenon.

arisen by duplication of a short sequence (Fig. 4), this cannot
account for the 16 orphan nucleotides that show no significant
homology to any known sequences, other than the five consecutive nucleotides (CCACT) and two triplets (CGG and CGA)
that correspond to bases from the adjacent wild-type sequence
5' to the insertion. Such mutations are not unprecedented (37)
and may be the result of illegitimate recombination or a
replication error. The presence of an in-frame stop codon,
assuming the size of the insertion is indeed 16 bases, may be
important in distinguishing this HSCR-associated rearrangement from other genuine activating rearrangements of RET
observed in neuroendocrine tumors (38-41). Interestingly, this
rearrangement does not produce a penetrant phenotype in the
father while the affected sons are typical short-segment cases
(aganglionic to the proximal sigmoid colon).
The detection of the G93S mutation in family 32 (Table 1)
was unexpected for two reasons. First, the substitution of a
serine for a glycine residue is normally thought of as a
conservative one. While the possibility remains that G93S
constitutes a rare polymorphism, it was not observed in 96
control individuals. Second, given the presence of CSC in the
mother (Fig. 2), it was expected a priori that she would harbor
the mutation. Digestion with BsrFl revealed that the father
transmitted the G93S mutation to his two sons (Fig. 2). In
light of the fact that both children have total colonic aganglionosis, while neither parent has biopsy-proven HSCR, it may
be that yet unknown sequence variants in each parent's
copy of RET have acted in concert to produce total colonic
aganglionosis in the offspring. The mother was found to be
heterozygous for a silent Eagl polymorphism at alanine 45
(29), which also occurred in her sons. Curiously, the same
Eagl ' + ' allele she carries is seen in significant excess on the
Mennonite HSCR haplotype that is transmitted to affecteds
(59% vs. 24% on untransmitted chromosomes; x2 = 12.08),
while it is observed in just 21% of controls (12,29). At present,
the significance of this allele is not known. Alternatively, the
mother's CSC and/or her genotype may be unrelated to her
children's HSCR.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

DNA isolation
DNA was isolated from whole blood using either a 'salting-out' procedure
(50) performed manually or by an automated phenol-chloroform extraction
protocol as implemented on the Autogen 540 (Integrated Separation Systems,
Natick, MA).
PCR and primers
Primer sequences necessary to amplify all 20 RET exons were obtained from
previously published sources or designed using the Macintosh program Oligo,
Version 4.0 (National Biosciences, Inc., Plymouth, MN) based on intronic
nucleotide sequence (29,51-54). Numbering of RET nucleotides and amino
acids is based on these studies. PCR analyses were canned out as previously
described (7). All primers were synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville,
Alabama). Primer sequences ajid PCR conditions for novel primers are
available from the authors upon request.
Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP)
Given its dense, pre-cast mini-gels, programmable temperatures and runtimes, and use of silver staining as a detection method, we routinely use the
PhastSystemS (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscalaway, NJ) as a convenient, highresolution alternative (55-57) to conventional SSCP (58,59). SSCP analyses
were done in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications, typically 24
samples at a time at 15°C. All exons were also run 1.5 times as long at 8°C.
For a 225 base pair product, run times were usually on the order of 300 volthours (about 45 min) at I5°C. The manufacturer's silver staining protocol
required roughly 45 min in order to clearly resolve electrophoretic bands.
Direct DNA sequencing
For each sample where mobility shifts were detected, residual single-stranded
primers and deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) were removed from the
PCR product by treatment with 2—4 units/|il Exonuclease I and Shrimp
Alkaline Phosphatase, respectively (United Slates Biochemical, Cleveland,
OH). Cycle sequencing was then carried out on 1 uj of the PCR product
using the dsDNA Cycle Sequencing System (Life Technologies, Inc.,
Gaithersburg, MD), according to conditions specified by the manufacturer.
Sequencing primers were usually identical to PCR primers, although internal
primers were occasionally used. All products were sequenced from both
directions.

Patients and controls
Patients were ascertained through the American Pseudo-obstruction and
Hirschsprung's Disease Society, Inc. (APHS) and the American Pediatric
Surgical Association (APSA), or obtained through referrals. After family
history questionnaires and informed consent were received, venipuncture
samples were obtained from affected family members and other relevant
members of each kindred. All patients underwent surgery for biopsy-proven
HSCR. Aganglionic segment length, where information was available, was
considered 'short' if the affected portion extended from the rectum to the
sigmoid colon and 'long' if the affected portion extended beyond the sigmoid
colon; 'total colonic aganglionosis' was used to refer to cases where the
aneuronal portion extended into the small bowel. If one affected family
member was a long-segment case, then this family was classified as a longsegment family (6). Table 1 describes the 80 patients chosen for mutation
screening. The sample of 80 probands represents the diversity of phenotypes
seen in HSCR, but is not a random sample of the HSCR population, i.e. it
does not consist of mostly short segment, simplex cases (6). The controls
were at least 96 phenotypically normal members of the Centre d'Etude du
Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) reference families (49) or other individuals
from studies in our laboratory unrelated to HSCR.
