A case of paraprosthetic-enteric fistula occurring after aortic aneurysectomy and Dacron graft placement is reported. Two and one-half years after aneurysectomy, the patient presented with the problems of fever of obscure origin, arthralgias, and anemia. The diagnosis of paraprosthetic-enteric fistula was made preoperatively by endoscopy. The role of endoscopy in the evaluation of postaneurysectomy complications is emphasized.
