CASE REPORT

Paraprosthetic-Enteric Fistula
Role of Preoperative Endoscopy

T h e surgical treatment of aortic aneurysm
has become well established since classic studies
in the 1950's called attention to the high fatality
rate of nonsurgically treated aneurysms (1) and
successful excision and graft replacement of
such aneurysms (2). Several reports have indicated that elective abdominal aneurysectomy
with graft replacement can be done with a mortality rate less than 10% (3-5), and that the
procedure results in prolonged survival (6-8).
However, with performance of a large number
of abdominal aneurysectomies there have been
reports of several complications. These include
false aneurysm formation (3, 9), retroperitoneal
hemorrhage (10), aortoenteric fistula formation (10, 11),
paraprosthetic-enteric fistula (11), infection (11-16), ureteral obstruct i o n (16), s e p t i c e m b o l i z a t i o n (16), a n d
hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (17, 18).
T h e major manifestations of aortoenteric and
paraprosthetic-enteric fistulas are hemorrhage
and infection (11, 12). Patients with such fistulas often present with catastrophic and exsanguinating hemorrhage, resulting in a high
mortality rate. T h e diagnosis of these fistulas is
usually established at laparotomy or necropsy (10, 11). Review of the literature reveals
one case in which endoscopy suggested the presence of aortoduodenal fistula (19). However,
the evidence in that case was a p p a r e n t l y not

convincing enough to w a r r a n t surgical intervention. T h e r e have been no reports in which a
definitive endoscopic preoperative diagnosis of
paraprosthetic-enteric fistula has been made
with resultant successful surgical intervention,
and furthermore, there are only two previous
reports of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy associated with aortic prosthesis (17, 18).
It is the purpose of this case report to describe
our experience with a patient who developed a
paraprosthetic-enteric fistula 289 years after resection of an abdominal aneurysm. Interestingly, the patient's presenting problem was
that of fever of unknown origin. A definitive
diagnosis of paraprosthetic-enteric fistula was
established endoscopically and shortly thereafter surgical repair successfully carried out.

C A S E REPORT
A 64-year-old white male was referred to the University
of Kansas Medical Center with a 6-month history of fever,
lethargy, arthralgias, and weight loss. During the period
he took 8 to 16 aspirin tablets daily with partial relief of
symptoms. He had experienced intermittent dyspepsia for
many years, but denied abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, melena, and hematochezia. Past medical history
disclosed that abdominal aneurysectomy with bifurcation
Dacron graft placement was done 2~ years prior to the
present admission. Physical examination revealed blood
pressure 140/70 mm Hg, heart rate 80 beats/min, and
temperature 38~C. The patient appeared pale and chronically ill. Examination of the head, neck, lungs, and heart
was unremarkable. The abdomen was scaphoid, soft, and
no organomegaly, mass, bruits, or tenderness were appreciated. The right knee was warm, tender, and slightly
swollen. There was bilateral pitting, pretibial, and ankle
edema. A stool specimenwas negativefor occultblood.
Laboratory studies revealed hematocrit reading 31%, he-

moglobin 10.9 g/100 ml, white blood cell count 9,000/cu
mm with normal differential, and platelet count 430,000/cu
mm. Blood smear revealed hypochromic microcytic appearing red blood cells. The serum iron was 45 ~g/100 ml and
the TIBC 375 ug/100 ml. Latex fixation test for rheumatoid factor was weakly positive at 1:20. The following tests
were within normal limits or negative: serum electrolytes,
blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, LE
preparation, antinuclear antibodies, bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, SGOT, SGPT, serum protein electrophoresis,
urinalysis, and cultures of blood, urine, and sputum. Several
stool specimens were negative for occult blood. Aspiration
of synovial fluid from the right knee yielded a small amount
of clear fluid which upon analysis revealed 677 white blood
cells/cu mm, glucose 108 mg/100 ml, protein 2.5 g/100 ml.
No crystals were observed and cultures were negative. Skin
tests for tuberculosis and histoplasmosis were negative. A
chest x-ray was unremarkable. Joint films revealed only a
small effusion of the right knee and bilateral subperiosteal
new-bone formation of the distal femur and tibia. A barium-enema examination revealed diverticulosis and an upper-gastrointestinal series with small-bowel followthrough
disclosed a small sliding hiatat hernia and duodenal and
jejunal diverticula. On retrospective examination after endoscopy (see below) a filling defect could be visualized in the
third portion of the duodenum (Figure 1).

Upper panendoscopy using the Olympus GIF-D2 was
performed revealing a small hiatal hernia and several superficial antral erosions. The duodenal bulb mucosa was
s~)mewhat nodular and an intraluminal mass was noted in
the third portion of the duodenum (Figure 2). Initially the
mass appeared to be food material, but after washing and
closer inspection was found to have the appearance of Dacron fiber (Figure 3). There was no bleeding and only minimal pulsation. Because of the endoscopic findings and the
patient's past history, a diagnosis of paraprosthetic-enteric
fistula with secondary graft infection and slow gastrointestinal blood loss was made.
The patient underwent a laparotomy and sternotomy.
The duodenal fistula and bile stained aortic prosthesis were
exposed (Figures 4 and 5). First, a Dacron prosthesis was
sutured end-to-side to the descending thoracic aorta, then
passed retroperitoneally down the left gutter to the left common iliac artery, where another branch was then passed
across the pelvis to the right common iliac artery and endto-side anastomoses were performed. The old prosthesis and
the third portion of the duodenum were then resected and
an end to end duodenostomy formed. (Figure 6). Special
stains of the graft thrombus revealed fungi consistent with
Candida and bacteria. Cultures of the graft grew Corynebacterium, E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacteriaceae, /3Streptococcus and Enterococci. Postoperatively the patient

was treated with Cephalothin and Gentamycin. Twentyfour hours postoperatively, fever and arthralgias had disappeared. The patient's postoperative course was otherwise
unremarkable except that he complained of numbness in his
right leg and it was slightly cooler than his left leg. Two
weeks after discharge he returned to the hospital with a cool
and cyanotic right leg in which no pulses were palpable. At
operation he was found to have an occluded right common
iliae artery. An extrafascial, subcutaneous femorofemoral
end-to-side Dacron prosthesis was placed. The patient recovered uneventfullyand is currently asymptomatic.
DISCUSSION

The postoperative complications of abdominal aortic bypass grafting are listed in Table 1.
Recent studies have indicated that fistulous
communications between the intestine and
aorta occur in 0.6-2.3% (10, 11) of survivors of
abdominal aortic bypass grafting and on rare
occasions spontaneously (20). The time interval
from operation varies from hours to as long as
14 years (11, 13). Any area of the small intestine may be involved. However, the distal

duodenum is the most common site (21) because
of its intimate anatomical relationship to the infrarenal aorta and its fixed retroperitoneal position. Aortoenteric or paraprosthetic-enteric fistula manifests itself clinically as infection a n d /
or hemorrhage (11, 12), with various investigators reporting a mortality rate from 4 0 75~ (10-13).
Recently, Elliot (11) has called attention to
the infectious aspect of aortic reconstructive surgery and has i n t r o d u c e d the t e r m p a r a prosthetic-enteric fistula to designate those fistulas which extend through the intestinal wall
only to the outer capsule of the prosthesis, without communicating with the lumen of the graft
or aorta. It has been postulated that such lesions
are caused by laceration of the intestinal wall
during surgery, impairment of the blood supply
to a very small area of intestine, or erosion of
the intestinal wall by direct contact of the pulsating graft (11). Whenever there is a defect in
the intestinal wall, there may well be passage of
bacterially contaminated intestinal contents
into the peritoneal cavity or around adjacent
structures. Localization of an infection around a
synthetic graft may result in retroperitoneal abscess or septicemia, with systemic manifestations (11, 13, 22) such as fever, arthralgias, arthritis, weight loss, and lethargy. Prompt
detection of an infected graft with early surgical
intervention results in increased survival (11).
T h e diagnosis of paraprosthetic-enteric a n d
aortoenteric fistulas is difficult and is rarely
made by barium contrast studies or arteriography (11, 19). The upper-gastrointestinal
series in our patient was interpreted as only
showing a hiatal hernia and two diverticuli.
However, upon retrospective examination a filling defect was thought to be present in the third
portion of the duodenum. Endoscopy carried
out preoperatively unequivocally proved that
our patient's Dacron graft had eroded into his
duodenum. It is likely that the patient's anemia
was secondary to the duodenal erosion by the
graft, and to superficial gastric erosions induced
by salicylates (23), since no direct communicaDigestive Diseases, Vol. 20, No. 11 (November 1975)

tion between the duodenal and aortic lumens
was found on pathological examination.
The patient's right-knee pain and swelling is
consistent with the periarthritis and effusion
d e s c r i b e d in t w o p r e v i o u s l y r e p o r t e d
patients (17, 18) with infected aortic prosthesis
and subperiosteal new bone formation. The
patient's normal chest x-ray, the lack of evidence of pulmonary disease, and the rapid disappearance of joint symptoms after resection of
the infected prosthesis all support the hypothesis that the infected graft was the cause of his
hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.
The Olympus GIF-D2 panendoscope is long
enough to reach the distal duodenum in most
patients. Therefore it can be used in the evaluation of patients who, after aortic grafting,
present with hemorrhage or occult infection. By

direct visualization the diagnosis can be made
definitively rather than by exclusion as in the
past. This would then allow for a definite plan
of operative intervention rather than exploratory laparotomy. Finally, the diagnosis of
paraprosthetic-enteric fistula should be considered in patients with aortic grafts who develop
obscure fever, joint symptoms, or anemia without obvious cause and in whom upper-gastrointestinal x-rays (24) suggest an abnormality in
the distal duodenum.
SUMMARY

A case of paraprosthetic-enteric fistula occurring after aortic aneurysectomy and Dacron
graft placement is reported. Two and one-half
years after aneurysectomy, the patient
presented with the problems of fever of obscure
origin, arthralgias, and anemia. The diagnosis
of paraprosthetic-enteric fistula was made preoperatively by endoscopy. The role of endoscopy in the evaluation of postaneurysectomy
complications is emphasized.
