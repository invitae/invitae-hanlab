Acetazolamide Treatment of
Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis
Probable Mechanism of Action
Frederic

Q. Vroom, MD;

Maureen A. Jarrell; Thomas H. Maren, MD

Following administration of glucose
and insulin to three patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis, serum K fell 1.9
mM. After administration of acetazolamide, 250 mg four times daily, serum K fell
0.9 mM, a substantial difference. In
normal persons glucose and insulin
lowered serum K 0.5 mM, and this was
not changed substantially by acetazolamide.
The metabolic acidosis induced by the
drug appears to be responsible for the
change in decrement of serum K and for
the amelioration of symptoms in the
patients. The findings agree with earlier
reports that metabolic acidosis lowers the
rate of entry of K\m=+-\into muscle, thus
opposing the heightened or pathological
entry of K\m=+-\into muscle cells during
attacks of the disease.

with hyperkalemic periodic paral¬
ysis, acetazolamide administration re¬
duced the influx of K> from serum to
red blood cells,1·2 and because the
experiments established a steady
state, efflux of K> also was reduced.

consistent, yet it suggested that the

drug might prevent paralysis by
reducing Kr flux into or out of red
blood cells or other tissues. Hyperkalemia in man or experimental animals
invoked by K* administration or by
exercise also was lessened by acetazol¬
amide, in terms of both rate of

increase and absolute level.3 In these
studies, blood glucose decreased dur¬
ing attacks of paralysis; this effect
also was minimized by acetazolamide,
suggesting an alteration in glucose
metabolism. When the magnitude of
hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia was
modified, the severity of the clinical

attack was lessened considerably by
acetazolamide.
The periodic paralyses appear to be
diseases in which serum K* is un¬
stable; diverse stimuli trigger attacks,
and there are increased K+ fluxes
between serum and other cells. Other
abnormalities include dilation of sarcoplasmic reticulum, with accumula¬
tion of glycogen, vacuolization of
muscle, and decreases in skeletal
muscle membrane potentials. De¬
creased calcium-binding and some en¬
zyme activities of sarcoplasmic retic¬
ulum have been reported for three
cases of thyrotoxic hypokalemic peri¬
odic paralysis and one sporadic case.46
Other possible derangements of ionic
pumping of sodium and potassium or
carbohydrate metabolism have long
been suspected.7
The present paper describes a black
family with hypokalemic periodic pa¬
ralysis, treatment with acetazolamide
and other diuretics, and studies to
define the action of acetazolamide and
the mechanism triggering attacks.
(This is the second black family with
this disease to be reported; the first
was described by Talso et al.s) The
chief finding was that, in the provoca¬
tive test (insulin and glucose loading),
which lowers serum 1, acetazolamide
notably blunted the hypokalemic ef¬
fect.

These studies, coupled with the
known capacity of acetazolamide to
produce metabolic acidosis,9 the ef¬
fects of acidosis that reduce K* influx
from serum to muscle,1011 and the
increased K* entry from serum to
muscle during attacks,12·13 suggest the
following mechanism for the benefi¬
cial effects of the drug:
Attacks are usually associated with
greatly increased K> entry from
serum to muscle, so that serum K+
drops about 2 mM. Acetazolamide
induces a metabolic acidosis, the
effect of which is to decrease K+
influx from serum to muscle, thus
opposing the abnormality that causes

paralysis.

produced limb or trunk weakness apparent
to a casual observer during everyday activ¬
ities, but not severe enough to prevent
sitting, standing, or walking. Severe
attacks prevented these activities. At no
time was respiration impaired. The aver¬
age duration of moderate or severe attacks
was one or two days; mild attacks often

lasted weeks or months.
The four patients were evaluated for the
following (Table 1): complete blood count;
erythrocyte sedimentation rate; serum cho¬
lesterol, calcium, and phosphorus; creatine

phosphokinase (CPK); thyroxine as T4;
two-hour postprandial blood glucose;
VDRL test and electrophoresis; creatinine
clearance and urinalysis; chest x-ray films
and intravenous pyelogram; electromyo¬
graphy and nerve stimulation. Results of
these studies were normal unless noted
otherwise. Twenty-four-hour urinary aldosterone level was obtained after seven
days of a high sodium chloride diet
containing at least 8 gm of sodium per day.
Urinary renins were checked each morn¬

ing.
Case 1.-Patient 1 was strong and
muscular in his youth. At age 22, on
entering the Marine Corps, his first attack
of generalized weakness occurred after
running five miles. The weakness persisted
for three weeks. Thereafter, attacks were

precipitated by

rest

following prolonged

calisthenics.
In August 1972, he was a muscular, 27year-old man with excellent strength and
normal reflexes. Results of a biceps muscle
biopsy were normal except for a few scat¬
tered, small, rounded muscle fibers, stained
by Gomori trichrome, which were both type
I and type II fibers by histochemical stain¬
ing. In quantitative electromyography of
the opposite biceps, the mean action poten¬
tial duration was 11.7 msec (normal 10.4
msec ± 20%). Ulnar motor nerve conduc¬
tion was normal at 62 meters/sec in the
wrist-elbow segment; ulnar sensory nerve
conduction was also normal at 56 meters/
sec. Blood pressure and attacks of paralysis
were both controlled over the subsequent
II months by acetazolamide, 250 mg four
times a day (Table 1).
Case 2.-Patient 2, 31 years old, had
weakness of elbow flexors and extensors
and hip flexors. Tendon reflexes were
diminished but present. Muscle biopsy
results were normal except for minimal
type II muscle fiber atrophy. Results of
electromyography and motor and sensory
nerve conduction studies were normal. Oral
acetazolamide, 250 mg four times daily,
resulted in normal strength, return of
reflexes, and virtual freedom from attacks
for 12 months (Table 1).

muscular and well developed, had minimal
weakness so that a push-up was
done with difficulty. Tendon reflexes were
hypoactive in the arms and absent in the
legs. There was an abnormally short mean
duration of motor unit potentials (5.4 msec)
in the biceps when strength was reduced to
just being able to overcome gravity. No
spontaneous electrical activity was noted
on sampling numerous proximal and distal
limb muscles during the attack. Nerve
conduction was normal except for a
decrease in the amplitude of the evoked
muscle action potential.
Ten and fifteen days after initiating oral
administration of acetazolamide, 250 mg
four times daily, right and left renal colic
occurred. Some gravel was passed. On
examination two weeks later, while still on
acetazolamide, serum uric acid was 7.8 and
8.5 mg/100 ml (before acetazolamide ther¬
apy, serum uric acid level had been 5.5 and
5.8 mg/100 ml; normal, 3.4 to 7.8 mg/100
ml); the urinary uric acid value was 700

urinary calcium value was 85 mg
(normal, less than 250 mg); and urinary pH
was 5 to 6. Roentgenographic examination
for renal calculi showed no abnormality.
The episode was attributed to elevated
plasma and tissue uric acid due to inhibi¬

discontinued and orally administered
methazolamide, 100 mg initially and later
50 mg every eight hours, was substituted
because it probably does not block urinary
excretion of uric acid." Attacks of paral¬
ysis were then well controlled (Table 1),
and no further episodes of renal colic
occurred during the subsequent 12
months.
Acetazolamide (500 mg in two minutes)
was administered intravenously during an
induced attack (Fig 1). The course of weak¬
ness and recovery appeared to be unaf¬
fected by this dose.

right biceps muscle biopsy were normal
except for a few scattered, small, round
muscle fibers that were both type I and
type II by histochemical stains. Electro¬
myography and nerve conduction tests
showed no abnormalities. Serum electrophoresis showed a hyper-/?- and diffuse
hyper-y-globulinemia (1.4 and 1.8 gm/100
ml, with a normal of 0.6 to 1.2 and 0.6 to 1.6

gm/100 ml, respectively). Dyazide (triam-

terene, 50 mg, and hydrochlorothiazide, 25

mg), given orally once daily, resulted in
normal strength and reflexes, as well as
good control of attacks of paralysis and
hypertension for nine months, after which
time equally good control was obtained
with orally administered acetazolamide, 1
gm per day (Table 1).
None of the patients received supple¬
mental potassium.

the cubital vein, and the initial blood
samples were drawn. One hour later
glucose (1.75 gm/kg, orally as Glucola) and
insulin (regular, 20 units intramuscularly)
were administered. Blood samples were
drawn every half hour for the duration of
the experiment and analyzed for pH,

sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate,
glucose, and inorganic phosphate. Samples

also drawn every 90 minutes for
determination of red blood cell potassium
influx. Following the initial control study,
each volunteer was placed on acetazo¬
lamide (250 mg four times a day). After
one week, the volunteer returned and was
admitted to the hospital, and the test was
repeated. Procedures were fully explained
to the normal volunteers and to the
patients, and written consent was ob¬
tained. The physicians in attendance were
ready for measures to counter respiratory
failure, although, to our knowledge, this
has never been reported following glucoseinsulin administration.
Serum sodium and potassium levels were
determined by flame photometry, and
serum chloride and bicarbonate by an auto¬
mated system of chemical analysis. Blood
glucose was measured by blood sugar kit,
blood pH by blood gas analyzer, and serum
phosphate by the Whitehorn modification
of Bell-Doisy method.15 Blood thyroxine
content was obtained by means of a T4
diagnostic kit; creatine phosphokinase val¬
ue was determined by the Rosalki assay;
aldosterone level was obtained by radioimmunoassay. Potassium influx to red cells
was determined in triplicate by modifica¬
tion of a method described previously.'

Patients were evaluated frequently dur¬

Electrocardiograms and vital capacities
were monitored. Weakness was always
associated with a decrease or absence of
tendon reflexes in the muscle involved.
Weakness was considered mild if gravity
could be overcome and the force of resist¬
ance was good or very good, but definitely
less than the attack-free state. With
moderate weakness, the force of resistance
was

weak; with

severe

weakness, gravity

could not be overcome. Attacks were
restricted if weakness was only in one limb
and were generalized if weakness involved
more than one limb. The limb used for
obtaining blood samples was not tested.

RESULTS
Metabolic Findings in Patients

Before drug (Fig 1, A) the patient
was in normal acid-base balance,
serum pH 7.41 and C02 28 mM. During
the test, while receiving the drug, (Fig
1, B), serum pH was 7.39 and C02 21
mM. During drug treatment, serum
K+ was slightly reduced (to 3.6 mM),
and blood glucose and serum phos¬
phate were unchanged. The flux stud¬
ies on entry of K* to red cells (before
glucose-insulin) showed that acetazo¬
lamide reduced flux about 20%, in
agreement with other data on normals
and patients with hyperkalemic peri¬
odic paralysis.1·2
Glucose-insulin lowered serum K*
2.0 and 1.8 mM in two tests before the
drug (Fig 1, A). In the same test
during drug treatment, the K* decre¬
ment was 0.6 mM (Fig 1, B).
Table 2 extends the principal find-

ing of Fig 2 to two other patients,
showing again that the effect of
glucose-insulin on serum K* is sub¬
stantially lessened by acetazolamide.
There is also the suggestion that
acetazolamide modifies the fall in
serum

The effect of the glucose-insulin
test on the influx of K* to red cells
was equivocal in the experiments of
Fig 1. Before treatment with acetazo¬
lamide (Fig 1, A), one test showed no
change in K+ influx, the other a trans¬
ient decrease. During treatment with
acetazolamide (Fig 1, B), K* influx
lowered but glucose-insulin
was
caused no further change. (Further
data on this point are given in Fig

3.)

Glucose-insulin produced marked
weakness in the two control tests (Fig
1, A); this was not altered by intrave¬
nous administration of acetazolamide.
After long-term acetazolamide ad¬
ministration, there was much less
weakness following glucose-insulin,

although weakness was
abolished (Fig 1, B).

not

entirely

The effect of acetazolamide on the
blood glucose curves following glu¬
cose-insulin is shown in Fig 2. The
drug reduced the glucose level and
shortened recovery time in two of the

patients.

Metabolic Findings in
Normal Volunteers

The four normal persons developed
all the characteristics of chronic
carbonic anhydrase inhibition: lower¬
ed serum pH, C02, and K+, and normal
Na+ and P04= (Table 3). There was no
respiratory acidosis.
In these normal subjects, the effect
of glucose-insulin on serum K* was
slight (Table 3) compared to the
patients (Table 2). The fall in serum
K+ averaged 0.6 mM before drug and
0.42 mM during treatment. This is not
a significant difference, but in two of
the four, (Fig 3, top right and bottom
right) the drug did appear to reduce
the decrement in K* (not shown in the

figure).
Long-term administration of aceta¬

zolamide reduced K+ influx into
normal red cells (Fig 3), as in the
patients (Fig 1). Glucose-insulin in¬
creased K> flux into red cells, and

acetazolamide

opposed this effect (Fig

3).

180

Differences in blood glucose follow¬
ing glucose-insulin, before and after
acetazolamide, were small. Acetazo¬
lamide seemed to elicit a higher peak
and more rapid fall than observed in
the controls (Fig 4). More work is
needed to confirm this.

Therapeutic Effect of
Acetazolamide in Hypokalemic
Periodic Paralysis
Relation to Other Drugs Used.—All
four patients were much improved by
acetazolamide. Only occasional mild
attacks were observed or reported.
Some mild weakness persisted in case
4 during treatment, but much less
than before treatment.
Serum HC03- and acetazolamide
levels during one year usually showed
an acidosis and presence of drug,
although these were occasionally less
than expected, indicating some failure
of compliance (Table 4). The data were
not adequate to correlate serum pH
and HC03- at any given time with
either clinical effects or protection
against K> fall in serum. However,
during the glucose-insulin tests of Fig
1 and Table 2, there was always some
acidosis during acetazolamide treat¬

ment.

The minimum effective dose of
acetazolamide for control of this
disease cannot be determined preci¬
sely from our data, but it is probably
500 to 1,000 mg daily, in single or
divided doses. This is the dosage
usually given for glaucoma and yields
full inhibition of carbonic anhydrase.9
Methazolamide appears to be effec¬
tive at a lower dose, as in glaucoma. In
our view, methazolamide might pres¬
ently be the drug of choice, since it
probably will not cause uric acid
stones14

(case 3).

The beneficial effect of Dyazide
(case 4) is not due to carbonic anhy¬
drase inhibition or to metabolic acido¬
sis. It is likely that the K+-retaining
and NaMosing effect of this combina¬
tion is responsible.8

were taken as a
model for attacks of the disease. The
effects of acetazolamide were studied
in this context.
The main finding relevant to the
effect of acetazolamide on the disease
is that of stabilizing serum K+ against
the fall. Since acidosis reduces the

influx of K+ into muscle (and probably
other sites as well),10·11 it is reasonable
to assume that acetazolamide works
through the induction of acidosis; the
acidotic state opposes the tendency of
K+ to leave serum for intracellular
sites in normals and in patients with
this disease.

This mechanism invoking metabolic
acidosis appears to fit all the facts at
hand, in the present and other studies.
Direct action of acetazolamide at the
muscle membrane had been hard to
visualize, since there is no carbonic
anhydrase in muscle and since we
have shown that there is no direct
effect of the drug on K* exchange in
isolated muscle" or in red blood cells
in vitro.1
Griggs et al suggested that acidosis
might be the key factor.18 To test this,
they discontinued acetazolamide and
administered NH4C1 to one patient.
Unfortunately, the dose was too small,
the metabolic acidosis achieved by
acetazolamide was actually dissipated

during NH4C1 treatment, and the
attacks returned. This critical experi¬
ment remains to be done, but would
require some 10 gm or more of NH4C1
per day.
Viskoper et al19 found that intrave¬
nously administered NH4C1 (2 gm)
improved the electromyogram results
of one patient and NaHC03 (1 mEq/
min x 60 min) caused deterioration of
the electromyogram results, with a
frank paralytic attack.'9 These obser¬
vations are in qualitative agreement
with our data and conclusions, but
further work remains to be done,
including acid-base and K* measure¬
ments

following NH4C1. Furthermore,

acidosis and alkalosis may also have

effects directly on the disease unre¬
lated to K> movement, as suggested
by Viskoper et al's'9 NaHCO:, experi¬
ment, in which paralysis ensued with
normal serum K* levels.
The argument in favor of the role of
metabolic acidosis is supported by the
fact that, in a dose that completely in¬
hibits carbonic anhydrase, intrave¬
nously administered acetazolamide
(500 mg) has no perceptible effect on
an induced attack (Fig 1, A), whereas
equivalent or lower serum concentra¬
tion during chronic treatment does
ameliorate the symptoms. Viskoper et
al19 reported that intravenously ad¬
ministered acetazolamide abolished
an attack, but this attack was precipi¬
tated by NaHCO„ which was stopped
(with corresponding drop in serum
HCOr) when acetazolamide was giv¬
en (Fig 3 of their study).
We found, in agreement with Grob
et al,2" that glucose-insulin produced
only a modest hypokalemic effect in
normals. The effect of acetazolamide
in this situation is, thus, difficult to
observe, and we obtained only a small
difference in the K* decrement
between control and treated groups.
Quantitative considerations of the
overall K* flux from serum to muscle
as affected by this disease and by
acetazolamide have not been made. A
model calculation follows:
An adult with 30 kg of muscle and a
flux rate for K* of 50 millimols/kg/
hr21 moves 1,500 millimols per hour in
and out of muscle, from a serum
source of 12 millimols (4 mM x 3 liters
of serum) or an extracellular pool of 60
millimols (4 mM x 15 liters). In hypo¬
kalemic familial periodic paralysis,
the attack reduces serum or extracel¬
lular K* from 4 to 2 mM in about two
hours, which implies that the muscle
influx increases (from the extracel¬
lular fluid source) 15 millimols per
hour, or 1%. Thus, a relatively small
change appears to be the pathophysiological basis for the disease. This lends
credence to the likelihood that a rela¬
tively small metabolic alteration (ie,
slight acidosis) might reverse it.
The acidosis, as previously shown
for humans with unimpaired respira¬
tion, is metabolic and partially com¬
pensated.22 Serum HCO.r is lowered
some 5 mM and pH 0.1 unit. It is

to note that animal data
show that an intracellular (in muscle)
acidosis results from carbonic anhydrase inhibition.23 Serum K+ in the
present study is low normal in both
patients and the normal volunteers.
We have confirmed our earlier find¬
ing2 that acetazolamide in vivo re¬
duces flux of K> from plasma to red
cell. This may also reasonably be
ascribed to the metabolic acidosis.
However, this flux is so much smaller
(about one thirtieth) than that for
muscle that it is unlikely that altera¬
tions play a part either in the cause or
treatment of the disease.
Although acetazolamide may act by
its effect on K+ entry to muscle, this
leaves unexplained why, during an
attack, it is the resting muscle
membrane potential that is abnormal,
rather than the ratio of K+ between
plasma and muscle.7 It would also be
of great interest to explore the rela¬
tion of the present findings to Zierler's suggestion that the defect in
hypokalemic disease is failure of acti¬
vation of Na* conductance in the
sarcolemma.24 Acetazolamide could
correct this, if such a change were pH
sensitive, either directly or through an
effect on K+ entry.
Our data following glucose-insulin
show that acetazolamide tends to
reduce the peak level of blood glucose
(Fig 2) and to bring the level back to
normal more rapidly than in untreat¬
ed controls (Fig 4). It appeared that
the glucose was more rapidly metabol¬
ized or distributed; it is doubtful that
the effect of insulin was enhanced,
since acidosis causes relative resis¬
tance to insulin.25 We also show some
impairment of glucose tolerance in
patients with hypokalemic disease
(Fig 2 and also case 4, not shown). The
significance of these changes in rela¬
tion to the cause or treatment of the
disease is not clear.
Our clinical findings agree with
others 18·19 that acetazolamide is effec¬
tive in the treatment of hypokalemic
periodic paralysis, and our idea that
acidosis is the mechanism is related to
the finding that dichlorphenamide, a
carbonic anhydrase inhibitor of dif¬
ferent structure but also capable of
inducing acidosis, is effective.26

beneficial effect of acetazolamide in

Aw/perkalemic periodic paralysis is not

clear. There are some, but still insuffi¬
cient, data on the induction of attacks
following K+ administration or other
stimuli in the presence of acetazolam¬
ide.2·3 Since both hydrochlorothiazide
(not a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor in
the doses used) and acetazolamide
appear to control the hyperkalemic
form,2" it is probable that both act by
the chief pharmacological property
they share, kaluresis. Preliminary
data in this laboratory suggested that
the elevation of serum K> in hyperkal¬
emic paralysis was modified by aceta-

zolamide,' but more studies are need¬
ed, particularly since the induction of

acidosis should yield the reverse
effect. Considering the two diseases
as variations of an entity, we propose
that the major effect of acetazolamide
is to stabilize muscle membranes
against abnormal K+ fluxes, but the
intimate details of such processes
remain to be discovered.
