ABSTRACT

A new B-chain variant, Hemoglobin Windsor [Bll(A8)Val->Asp]
was discovered in a 9-month-old child who presented with a
hemolytic anemia of 59 g/1 with an intercurrent viral infection.
Her blood film demonstrated fragmented cells, target cells,
stipple cells, nucleated red cells, polychromasia and some
spherocytes,
indicative of acute hemolysis. Hemoglobin
electrophoretic studies were requested and a @-chain variant,
constituting 27% of the total hemoglobin, separated towards the
anode under alkaline conditions. The variant was unstable,
producing numerous "Hb H"-like inclusions and a positive
isopropanol stability test. The variant hemoglobin was purified
by precipitation. The variant B-chain was purified by column
chromatography and its tryptic peptides fractionated by high
performance
liquid chromatography. Amino acid analysis and
sequence data indicated that the valine at position ll(A8) had
been substituted by an aspartic acid residue. This substitution,
in the bottom of the heme pocket, has resulted in instability of
the hemoglobin molecule and an increase in oxygen affinity.

The variant appears to have resulted from a spontaneous
mutation as both parents are hematologically normal. A younger
sibling is also hematologically normal.

INTRODUCTION

A new unstable hemoglobin (Hb) variant, Hb Windsor or Bll(A81
Val->Asp, was detected in a 9-month-old female of Anglo-Saxon
descent who presented with a hemolytic anemia of 59 g/1
reticulocytosis of 77%.

and a

Her red cells showed hemolytic features,

including polychromasia and there were fragmented cells, target
cells, stipple cells, nucleated red cells and some spherocytes.
An unstable Hb was suspected and Hb electrophoretic studies were
performed. These demonstrated the presence of a fast moving Bchain variant.

This paper describes the characterization of Hb

The variant peptide coeluted with BT-3 and BT-13 and was
separated from them on the same HPLC column using ammonium
acetate/acetonitrile buffers.
Selected peptides were hydrolyzed in 6N HC1 ( 5 )

prior to

quantitative analysis by HPLC using a Waters "Picotag"

column

under conditions specified by the manufacturer.
The variant peptide was sequenced using an Applied Biosystems
model 380A sequenator. The phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were
identified by HPLC.
Oxygen equilibrium curves

(OECs) were determined at 370 C

using a HEM-0-SCAN apparatus (Aminco Instruments, Silver Springs,
HD). Modifications were made to the apparatus and procedures, the

most noteworthy being that the oxygenation mixture was admitted
intermittently, rather than continuously, to give a number of
discrete points on the curve. The modifications are described in
(6)and (7). The C02 content of the gas mixture was 5.8% giving a

pCOl value close to 41 Torr.
The OECs were determined on two occasions.

On the first of

these the measurements were made on the whole blood alone and the
Ps0 corrected from the PH of measurement to its value at pH 7.40

using the chart of Severinghaus ( 8 ) . On the second occasion,
measurements were made not only on whole blood but on suspensions
of red cells in an isotonic saline-phosphate-bicarbonate buffer.

The cells were washed three times in about ten

times their volume of the buffer and the OEC then measured on a
suspension of one part of cells in two parts of buffer.
On this second occasion, the red cells were also stripped of

2,3-DPG.

The method used was that of Lian et a1 (9) in which the

cells are incubated at 370 C for 4 hours
containing sodium bisulfite.

in a buffered solution

Before the OEC was determined the

cells were washed with, and resuspended in, the saline-phosphatebicarbonate buffer as described above.
The concentration of 2,3-DPG in the cells was measured by a
photometric method using either the Sigma kit [method similar to
that of Lowry et a1 ( l o ) ] or the Boehringer Mannheim kit

[method

of Ericson and de Verdier (1111.

of the vastly different nature of the substituted amino
