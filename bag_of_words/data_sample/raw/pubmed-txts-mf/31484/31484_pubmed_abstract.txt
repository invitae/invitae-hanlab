Several aspects of the stereoelectronic requirements of substrates of human erythrocytic purine nucleoside phosphorylase (E.C. 2.4.2.1) were elucidated providing the following information: (a) the N1 position cannot have a nonhydrogen substituent; (b) the 5'-OH group must be present for catalytic activity to be exhibited but is not an essential functional group for inhibitory action to be observed; (c) on the C8 position groups larger than -NH2 or -Br cannot be accommodated; (d) the syn-glycosyl conformation (i.e., 8-bromoguanosine) is acceptable but may not be an absolute requirement for phosphorolysis; (e) among nucleic base inhibitors methylation at N3, N7, or N9 vastly decreases the inhibitory properties as does a nitrogen in lieu of C-H in the 8 position. The results clearly indicate that this enzyme differs in its stereoelectronic requirements from the Escherichia coli enzyme.
