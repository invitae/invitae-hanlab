Certain individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) produce mutant forms of the low density
lipoprotein (LDL) receptor that fail to move from the
endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. Here, we
describe the cloning and expression of one such mutant
allele, FH 429. The mutation causes a substitution of a
Val for a Gly at residue 544. When recreated in an
expressible cDNA, this substitution gives rise to an
LDL receptor that is not transported to the cell
surface
and is rapidly degraded. Three previously mapped
transport-deficient alleles of the LDL receptor were
traced to the cysteine-rich repeats of the protein, suggesting that the generation of non-disulfide-bonded
(free) cysteinesmight cause the block in transport. The
FH 429 mutation is not located in a cysteine-rich region, however. We have attempted to test the role of
cysteine by expressing mutant cDNAs that encode proteins blocked in transport and predicted to contain free
cysteines. The results suggest that free cysteines are
not obligatory for the blocked intracellular movement
of mutant LDL receptors.

The human low density lipoprotein (LDL)’ receptor is a
cell surface glycoprotein of 839 amino acids that supplies cells
with cholesterol (1).The receptor is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum as a 120-kDa precursor that contains high
mannose asparagine-linked carbohydrate chains and serineand threonine-linked N-acetylgalactosamine (2). Transport
through the Golgi apparatus alters the protein to a 160-kDa
mature form that contains N-linked carbohydrates that have
been trimmed and sialylated and 0-linked sugars that have
been elongated by the addition of galactose and sialic acid (2).
The 160-kDa LDL receptor is transported to the cell surface
where it mediates the uptake of cholesterol-rich LDL particles
(1).

The LDL receptor contains an extracellular domain of 767
amino acids, a transmembrane domain, and a carboxyl-terminal domain of 50 residues located within the cytoplasm (3,
4). More than one-half of the extracellular domain is composed of cysteine-rich repeats, each of which spans 40 amino
acids and contains 6 cysteines (5). The repeats are of two
types. One type is present in seven copies, and these together
make up the ligand binding domain.2 The second type of
repeat, present in three
copies (5), is required for acid-dependent ligand dissociation and recycling of the receptor (6).
This latter repeat is similar in structure to the epidermal
growth factor (EGF), andfor this reason has been referred to
as a “growth factor” repeat (7). Growth factor repeats are
present in a diverse array of proteins, including other cell
surface receptors, blood clotting factors, growth factors, and
neurogenic loci in lower eukaryotes (6).
In at least two of the proteins that contain growth factor
repeats, the disulfide bonding pattern of the 6 cysteine residues has been elucidated. In EGF (8) and in prothrombin (9),
the first cysteine forms a covalent bond with the third cysteine, the second with the fourth, andthe fifth with the sixth.
It is likely that the same pattern will be present among all
proteins thatsharethis
repeat. It is also likely that the
presence of three such bonds within a 40-amino acid repeat
would lead to a tightly folded domain (10). Indeed studies of
EGF by nuclear magnetic resonance techniques have revealed
a compact triple-stranded P-sheet conformation held together
by the three disulfide-bonded cysteines (11).The disulfide
bonding pattern of the seven cysteine-rich repeats in the
ligand binding domain of the LDL receptor is at present not
known. However, chemical modification studies have shown
that most, if not all of the cysteines in the receptor are
involved in disulfide bonds (12, 13).
Recently, the characterization of naturally occurring mutations in the LDL receptor gene has revealed another possible role for the disulfide-bonded cysteines, namely, a role in
intracellular transport. These mutations are present in individuals with the genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia
(FH) andmay be divided into classes based on their disruption
of LDL receptor synthesis, intracellular transport, orvarious
binding activities (1).Three different FH mutations that slow
the transport of the protein to the plasma membrane have
been localized to thecysteine-rich repeats. The first mutation
was isolated from the Watanabeheritable hyperlipidemic
rabbit, an animal model of FH (14). In this mutation, a 12base pair (bp) deletion was found in the third cysteine-rich
repeat of the ligand binding domain. A second mutation,

Transport-deficient LDL Receptors
present in an individual known as FH 563, was localized to
the fifth repeat in this domain by nuclease S1 mapping (141,
and was later shown to be a 3-bpdeletion by DNA sequencing
(15).Cells harboring these two mutations produced a receptor
precursor with an M , of about 120,000 that possessed endoglycosidase H-sensitive carbohydrates characteristic of proteins that have not reached the Golgi apparatus (2, 14). One
hypothesis to explain the block in transport was that the
deletions were disrupting the formation of disulfide bonds in
the mutant repeat and that the cell was in some manner
sensing the unpaired or mispaired cysteines and preventing
transport (14).
This hypothesis was reinforced with the analysis of a third
transport-deficient LDL receptor (13). In this FH gene, a
single base pair change was present in an exon encoding one
of the growth factor repeats (the C repeat (5)). The mutation
converted a cysteine codon at amino acid 660 into anonsense
codon, and resulted in a protein of M , 100,000 that lacked a
membrane spanning domain (13). Cysteine 660 is the thirdof
six cysteines in the C repeat. In this protein the first and
second cysteines should exist in a free state, as their normal
paired counterparts (the third and fourth cysteines, respectively) were absent (13). These results provided further evidence that alterations in thedisulfide bonding pattern might
be responsible for the block in transport.
Naturally occurring mutations that alter transport to the
cell surface have recently been described in at least two other
proteins, and both may involve cysteines. First, Kishimoto et
ul. (16) demonstrated that some mutant genes for the common
@-subunitof the leukocyte adhesion proteins, found in subjects with leukocyte adhesion deficiency, encode proteins that
are not transported to the cell surface. Although the precise
location of the mutation is not known, the @-subunit contains
four cysteine-rich repeats (17), and it ispossible that defects
in these regions underlie the transport-deficient p-subunit
phenotypes. Second, in certain forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, mutations that substitute cysteine for a residue in the
glycine-X-Y repeat of the cy1 chain of collagen blockintracellular transport (18-21). These cysteine residues form abnormal interchain disulfide bonds thatare thought to block
transport (20, 21).
Here, we have characterized a fourth mutation in the LDL
receptor gene that encodes a transport-deficient protein. In
contrast to the earlier defects, this mutation does not reside
in the cysteine-rich repeats. To reexamine the requirement
for altered cysteines, we have recreated the stop codon at
position 660 in the LDL receptor in an expressible cDNA and
have confirmed that the mutantprotein is not transported to
the plasma membrane. However, when we converted the two
putative free cysteines into serines, the protein was still not
transported. Taken together, thesetwo lines of evidence suggest that unpaired or mispaired cysteines are not an essential
component of the block in transport to the
cell surface of this
class of mutant LDL receptors.
MATERIALS ANDMETHODS

Cloning and Mutagenesis-Genomic DNA was isolated from cultured fibroblasts (22) and analyzed by Southern blottingusing standard procedures (23). Restrictionfragment length polymorphism haplotype analysis of the LDL receptor gene was carried out as described
in Ref. 24. To clone the FH 429 LDL receptor gene, genomic DNA
(200 pg) was first digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI or
BgLII. The DNA was size-fractionated onsucrose gradients and fragments of approximately 15 kb (BamHI)or 11kb (BgtII),that together
span all exons of the gene (5), were cloned into a bacteriophage X
Charon 35 vector (25) exactly as described in Ref. 26. Recombinant
clones were identified by plaque hybridization using exon-specific
probes derived from the normal LDL receptor gene (5). Bacteriophage

13277

DNA inserts were subcloned into plasmid vectors and further subcloned into bacteriophage M13 vectors (27) for sequence analysis
(28).
For in vitro mutagenesis, DNA fragments from the expression
plasmid pLDLR2 (3) were subcloned into bacteriophage M13 vectors
and mutagenized according to published procedures (29). The desired
mutations were identified by plaque hybridization, sequenced, and
the appropriate DNA fragment was resected into pLDLR2. Plasmid
DNAs harboring the mutations were prepared by standard procedures
(23) and banded twice in CsC12 density gradients prior to transfection
analysis.
Culture and Transfection of Mammalian Cells-Simian COS-M6
cells were grown and transfected by a DEAE-dextran technique as
described by Esser et a1.' A mutant line ofChinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells lacking functional LDL receptors (kindly supplied by Dr.
Monty Krieger, Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Cambridge, MA)was maintained and transfected as
described in Ref. 30. Followingtransfection, CHO colonies expressing
the LDL receptor were identified by indirect immunofluorescence
(30). Several colonies transfected with a given LDL receptor plasmid
were cloned by limiting dilution and expanded into cell lines for
subsequent analysis. Radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation of LDL
receptors was carried outas described in Ref. 30. SDS-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and autoradiography were performed as described
H (endo H) and neurin Ref. 2. Endo-P-N-acetylglucosaminosidase
aminidase treatment of LDL receptor immunoprecipitates was carried out as described previously (30).
RESULTS

Previous studies with fibroblasts isolated from subject FH
429 demonstrated that only the 120-kDa precursor form of
the LDL receptor was present in these cells, that this protein
was not sensitive to digestion by extracellular Pronase, and
that theN-linked carbohydrate chains were sensitive to endo
H (31). Pedigree studies had suggested that FH 429 had
inherited the same transport-deficient allele from both parents (31).
Table I indicates
the results of a restriction fragmentlength
polymorphism analysis carried out onDNA isolated from FH
429, his mother, and his father. FH 429 was homozygous at
each of the 10 polymorphic sites scored, further suggesting
that he hadinherited the samemutant allele from both
parents. No gross rearrangements of the gene were detected
in these studies. RNA blotting revealed that theLDL receptor
mRNA in FH 429 was identical in size (5.3 kb) to thenormal
mRNA. Nuclease S1 mapping studies did not reveal a difference between the FH429 mRNA and thenormal mRNA (data
not shown).
The exact location of the mutation was determined by
cloning and sequencing all 18 exons of the FH 429 LDL
receptor gene. A single nucleotide change that altered the
amino acid sequence was detected (Table 11). A guanine
residue in the normal coding strand of exon 11 was changed
to a thymidine in FH 429, resulting in the substitution of a
Val for a Gly at position 544. This mutation is predicted to
destroy a restriction sitefor the enzyme SfuNI (Table 11). To
confirm this mutation in the genome of FH 429, we digested
genomic DNAswith SfuNI, subjected the fragments to Southern blotting, and hybridized the filter with a 32P-labeledprobe
derived from exon 11. In DNA derived from a normal individual, a fragment of 1.8 kb was generated (Fig. 1).In the FH
429 DNA, a larger fragment of 2.5 kb was generated by the
loss of the exon 11 SfuNI site and consequent extension of
the fragment to a site in intron 11. DNA isolated from both
parents of FH 429 showed a normal SfuNI band of 1.8kb and
an abnormal band of 2.5 kb. These results confirm that FH
429 is a truehomozygote. To search for other examples of the
FH 429 mutation, we screened genomic DNAs isolated from
23 FH individuals known to have inherited at least one
transport-deficient allele. The 2.5-kb SfuNI band diagnostic

Mutation in FH 429 (Gly-544 + Val-544)
The DNA sequence of exon 11 from FH 429 was determined by
the dideoxyterminator method after subcloning the appropriate fragment into a bacteriophage M13 vector. The sequence of both strands
of the DNAwas determined. The normalamino acid and DNA
sequence of exon 11 was derived from Yamamoto et al. (3) andSiidhof
et al. (5).The mutant amino acid and nucleotide residues in the LDL
receptor protein and gene of FH 429 are circled and underlined,
respectively. A cleavage site for the restriction enzyme SfaNI thatis
present in normal DNA is ouerlined. This site is destroyed by the G

with unlabeled methionine, and thensolubilizedand subjected
to immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody. Immediately after labeling, the cells transfected with the plasmid
encoding the wild-type sequence contained both the120-kDa
precursor and the 160-kDa mature receptor (Fig. 2A, zero
time). After a 2-h chase, essentially all of the precursor was
converted into the mature 160-kDa form. In contrast, cells
transfected with the mutant cDNA expressed only the 120kDa precursor (Fig. 2.4, rightpanel). With increasing times of
chase (up to 6 h), thisprotein was not converted into ahigher
molecular weight.
The N-linked carbohydrate chains of the 120-kDa form of
the normal LDL receptor are sensitive to endo H digestion,
while those of the 160-kDa mature form are resistant to this
glycosidase (Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with the

Plasmids encoding the indicatedprotein were transfected into a

receptor proteins were established and cultured as described (30). On
day 5 of cell growth, the cells were pulse-labeled with 150 pCi/ml of
[35S]methionine inmethionine-free Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum, followed bya chase for
the indicated time in medium containing 0.2 mM unlabeled methionine. In A , radiolabeled LDL receptors were immunoprecipitated
from solubilized cells and electrophoresed on 7% polyacrylamide gels

h at room temperature in 40 pl of30 mM sodium citrate (pH 5.5),
0.75% (w/v) SDS, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM
dithiothreitol, in the absence (-) or presence (+) of 40 milliunits of

containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 120 mM Tris-C1 (pH 6.8),and 4.6%
(w/v) SDS was added to each tube, followed by heating for 5 min at

out as described above. Autoradiography was performed for 24-48 h
at -70 "Cwith intensifying screens. The positions to which unlabeled

processing of the N-linked sugars to anendo H-resistantform
within the Golgi complex during conversion to the 160-kDa
form (2). The 120-kDa form of the Gly-544 ”+ Val-544 LDL
receptor was sensitive to endo H digestion (Fig. 2B), suggesting that this protein had not been transported to the medial
stacks of the Golgi compartment where conversion to endo H
resistance occurs (32).
From the pulse-chase experiments shown in Fig. 2, it was
apparent that LDL receptors with the Gly-544 ”+ Val-544
substitution were degraded more rapidly than the normal
protein. To measure more accurately the half-life of the
mutant LDL receptor, we pulse-labeled transfected CHO cells
with [35S]methionineand thenimmunoprecipitated receptors
after various times of chase. The isolated receptors were
subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis and the amounts were
quantified by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms.
These studies showed the half-life of the Gly-544 + Val-544
LDL receptor in transfected CHO cells was reduced to 5 h, as
compared with the 8.5 h half-life measured for the normal
protein (Fig. 3).
Exon 11encodes part of a long sequence of about 280 amino
acids that separates cysteine-rich repeats B and inCthe EGF
precursor region of the LDL receptor. The sequence in this
region is not cysteine-rich. Given the apparent autonomy of
the individual repeats with respect to disulfide bonding (14,
26), this observation made it unlikely that theGly-544 +Val544 mutation alteredthe disulfide bonding pattern, andtherefore the block in transport may have been independent of
abnormal disulfide bonding. To test thishypothesis, we created three additional mutations as
shown in Table 111. One of
these duplicated the previously described naturally occurring
FH mutation at residue 660 in the C repeat. This mutation
was generated in pLDLR2 by converting the cysteine codon
a t position 660 into a stop codon. Previous data indicated
that thisprotein is not moved to theGolgi complex (13). This
mutation generates two predicted non-disulfide-bonded cysx

teines at positions 646 and 656. To determine whether these
free cysteines were blocking transport, they were mutated to
serine codons in a second construct (mutation Cys-646, -656
”+ Ser, STOP 660). The third mutation produced a termination codon at residue 700 (mutation Thr-700 + STOP 700)
located just after the C
repeat. In this protein all of the
disulfide bonds should form normally.
Each of the mutantcDNAs was transfected into CHO cells
and then analyzed for intracellular transport in pulse-chase
experiments. In addition, the LDL receptor proteins were
assayed for their susceptibility to endo H and/or neuraminidase digestion, and their half-lives were measured. The results
of this series of experiments aresummarized in Table111. The
mutation that truncated the
protein within the C repeat(Cys660 + STOP 660), encoded a protein of 100 kDa that was
not secreted from the cell (despite the absence of a transmembrane domain) and that retained its endo H-sensitive carbohydrate chains. The mutation that converted the two putative
free cysteines in this protein into serines (Cys-646, -656 +
Ser, STOP 660), also gave rise to a transport-defective LDL
receptor with high mannose N-linked sugars (Table 111). As
with the Gly-544 + Val-544 LDL receptor, the half-lives of
these two mutantproteins were shorter than the
normal
protein. Truncationof the protein after the C repeatgave rise
to anLDL receptor that was secreted from the cell. Based on
the glycosidase sensitivity of the carbohydrate chains of this
protein(TableIII),
it appeared to travel along the same
intracellular transport pathway as the 160-kDa form of the
normal LDL receptor.
DISCUSSION

In this paper we have characterized several mutations in
the LDL receptor that block intracellular transport of the
protein. Based on pulse-chase and endo H sensitivity experiments, each of these mutations encode LDL receptors that
are not transported throughthe Golgi apparatus and that are
turned over more rapidly than the normal protein. The data
demonstrate that transport-deficient LDL receptors can arise
from alterations in the cysteine-poor as well as cysteine-rich
regions of the protein. The results presented in Table I11
further suggest that for mutations involving cysteine-rich
repeats, the cysteines themselves are not absolutely required
to block transport.
The most likely explanation for the block in transport of
these LDL receptor variants is that all of the mutations
prevent the polypeptide backbone from folding into its native
conformation (33). If this hypothesis is correct, then it is
likely that the unfolded state can be brought about by alterations that occur throughout the protein. The sensitivity of
the LDL receptor to thistype of mutation may depend on the
structure of the protein in a given region. Thus, domains of
the protein, such as hydrophilic loops on the surface, might
be expected to have less stringent folding requirements with
respect to the exact spacing and sequence of amino acids
making up the loop. In contrast, other regions of the LDL
receptor may be exquisitely sensitive to changes in primary
sequence. The presence of three disulfide bonds within the 40
residues of the growth factor repeats may place severe constraints on both the amino acid spacing and sequence required
for proper folding. In agreement with this prediction is our
finding that truncationof the LDL receptor immediately after
the C repeat (mutation Thr-700 ”+ STOP 700) results in a
secreted form of the protein(Table 111). Presumably, the
intact C repeat in this protein can adopt a native conformation, whereas mutations that truncate within this repeat can
not, leading to retention within the cell. In the mutations
