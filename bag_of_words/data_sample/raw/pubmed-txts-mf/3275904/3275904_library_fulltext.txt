Article abstract-Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a syndrome of progressive myopathic weakness affecting shoulder and
hip girdle and proximal arm and leg muscles. The disease occurs either sporadically or inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.
Autosomal dominant inheritance is rare. We report a large family with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance. Sixteen
members were affected with a disease characterized by proximal weakness, leg greater than arm, onset in the third decade,
elevated CK and CK MB levels, and myopathic EMGs and muscle biopsies. Linkage analysis revealed no conclusive linkage.
NEUROLOGY 1988;385-9

T h e nomenclature of neuromuscular diseases has
evolved as our diagnostic sophistication has increased,
and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) has been
profoundly affected, albeit in a corollary fashion.'P2
Various syndromes have been separated from t h e
LGMD classification, and, while the residual LGMD
patients are less phenotypically diverse, they remain
heterogeneous.
We have discerned a large, multigeneration kindred
with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance of
LGMD, which affords a unique opportunity as the same
gene defect should be responsible for the disease in all
affected members of the family. In this report, we detail
our findings in this family as regards clinical characteristics, EMG, muscle patholgy, and linkage analysis.
Materials and methods. Clinical studies. The diagnosis of
LGMD was based on weakness, tendon contractures, absent
deep tendon reflexes (DTRs), dysarthria, and elevated CK or
CK MB isoenzyme levels (table 1).
CK analysis was done on all family members. The upper
limit of normal for males was 120 IU/l and for females 80 IU/l.
All values were divided by the relevant upper limit to get a
relative level of CK (relative CK). A value greater than 1.5 was
considered abnormal.
CK isoenzyme fractionation by agarose electrophoresis
was also done on each sample. A percentage of MB was obtained, which when multiplied by the CK value gave an absolute amount of MB, abnormal being greater than 5 units. MB
values should be zero in normal individuals. Informed consent
approved by the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board was obtained on all subjects prior to
acquiring any blood specimens.

Linkage studies. Linkage analysis was done using 13 red
cell and serum polymorphisms (ABO,RH, MNS, JK, KELL,
FY, P, ACP1, HP, PGM1, ESD, GC, and BF). All markers
were informative for this family with the exception of the
KELL locus. Lod scores were calculated using the program
LIPED assuming LGMD in this family is an autosomaldominant trait with age-dependent penetrance. Using the method
outlined by Pericak-Vance et al,3we estimated the mean and
variance of age of onset based on the pedigreedata. Criteria for
diagnosis for linkage were the presence of clinical abnormalities (as in table 1)and an elevated CK and/or CK MB level.
Equal recombination was assumed for males and females (8,
= 8, [e = recombination fraction]).

Results. Clinical studies. The family is located primarily in southeastern West Virginia. T h e known pedi-

gree spans seven generations in which members of five
generations are still living (figure). The pedigree includes 144 persons of which 115 are alive and 61 of these
have been examined. Sixteen members are known to be
affected; another eight are suspected but remain unexamined. Analysis of critical matings in which all offspring were examined revealed that 18 (47%) of 38 were
affected (including dead, obligate carriers).
The clinical signs found in t h e 16 affected members
are listed in table 1 and are compared to t h e examined
normal family members. There was proximal weakness of the legs in 13 individuals and of the arms in 11.
None had arm weakness without leg weakness a n d leg
weakness preceded arm involvement in all, often by
several years. Distal weakness was seen in 11 individuals, but always in the presence of more significant

the eldest living member of the family and an obligate
carrier, had only dysarthria, tightened heel-cords, and
absent ankle jerks. All 16 affected members had absent
ankle jerks and 10 had tight heel-cords (the ankles could
not be dorsiflexed past 90’). No unaffected member had
either. Knee and arm DTRs were absent in none, but
were decreased in five affected individuals. Facial weakness was seen in three affected individuals. Age of onset
ranged from 18to 35 years of age with a mean of 24.8 and
a variance of 3.85 years3 Two patients were wheelchair-bound, this occurring in both approximately 20

CK levels were elevated in 15 of the 16 affected individuals and ranged from 1.6 to 9 times normal. The sole
affected member with a normal CK was the weakest, a
45-year-old man with quadriplegia. Fifteen affected
members had CK isoenzyme analysis and 13were found
to have elevated amounts of the MB fraction. The affected man with a normal CK had an abnormal level of
CK MB. The two affected persons with normal CK MB
levels both had abnormal CK levels. Either CK, CK
MB, or both were elevated in all 16 affected persons.
CK, relative CK, CK MB, and percentage of MB
inversely correlated with current age and years since
onset 0,< 0.01). Ambulatory function was also inversely correlated with CK, CK MB, relative CK, and years
since onset of symptoms.
Only three unaffected members had an elevation of
CK, all three being below the mean age of onset (8, 15,
and 22 years of age). One of the three (the 15-year-old)
was the only unaffected individual to have abnormal
levels of CK MB. None of the three had abnormalities
on physical examination and two were the children of
affected persons. The third child (the 8-year-old)had an
unaffected mother but an affected grandmother.
EMG results were available in eight family members,
all affected. All were indicative of a primary myopathic
process with small, brief, complex motor units seen in
eight patients, easily recruited to a full interference
pattern in six of the patients. Two persons had a decreased interference pattern secondary to the late stage
of disease. Abnormal spontaneous activity, consisting
of fibrillations and positive waves, was seen in seven of
eight studies. Electrical myotonia was not seen in any
study. Nerve conduction studies were normal, and evi-

fiber degeneration in six specimens, and endomysial
fibrosis in three. No specimen had all these features, but
all had several of them, and all eight biopsies were
interpreted as myopathic. Inflammation was not seen
in any of the biopsies. Vacuoles were seen in three
patients. Scattered atrophic, angulated fibers were
noted on three biopsies, but other neuropathic features
such as type grouping and group atrophy were not seen.
Electronmicroscopy was performed on biopsies from
three patients, and all were confirmatory of a myopathy,
but nonspecific.
Linkage studies. The lod scores for the 12 informative markers (see “Methods”) are listed in table 2.
Tight linkage was excluded for all markers except ABO
and P at 8 < 0.001 and for RH, MNS, and ACPl at 8 <
0.05 and was nearly excluded for PGM1, FY, ESD, and
BF. The highest lod score (2) was obtained with HP at
emax = 0.15 with 2 = 0.85. H P is mapped to chromosome 16 at q22.1.

Discussion. We have presented a large family with a
hereditary disease with the following characteristics:
(1) autosomal dominant inheritance; (2) proximal
greater than distal weakness; (3) leg weakness preceding
arm weakness; (4) absent ankle DTRs and frequent
heel-cord contractures; ( 5 ) onset in the third decade of
life; (6) elevated CK and/or CK MB; and (7) myopathic
EMG and muscle biopsy. Other dominantly inherited
muscular dystrophies are easily excluded: facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy because of the lack
of primary arm weakness and scapular winging; myotonic dystrophy because of the lack of clinical or electrical myotonia; and humeroperoneal dystrophy6
because of the lack of neck and elbow contractures and
because of different distributions of weakness.
The diagnosis of LGMD in our family was initially
based solely on the presence of weakness, particularly
proximal weakness. Disease expression was not limited
to this, however, as clearly weak individuals also had
dysarthria, heel-cord contractures, and facial weakness.
In addition, one obligate carrier had disease limited to
dysarthria, heel-cord contractures, and absent ankle
DTRs. Therefore, the diagnostic criteria were expanded

Early penetration of the blood-brainbarrier by HIV
Lionel Resnick, MD; Joseph R. Berger, MD; Paul Shapshak, PhD; and Wallace W. Tourtellotte, MD, PhD

Article abstract-CNS dysfunction occurs frequently in patients with HIV infection. To better define the role of HIV in the
pathogenesis of neurologic dysfunction, HIV isolation and antibody studies were investigated from the CSF in 52 seropositive
patients, 29 with and 23 without neurologic signs and symptoms, in various stages of disease development ranging from
asymptomatic to ARC to AIDS. HIV was recovered from the CSF of 5 of 29 (17%) patients with neurologic signs and symptoms
and 5 of 23 (22%)neurologically asymptomatic patients. All patients with positive CSF HIV cultures had antibodies directed
against HIV p24 and gp41 in serum and CSF by Western blot analysis and elevated intra-blood-brain-barrier total IgC and HIVspecific IgC synthesis rates. The frequency of CSF HIV isolation from the group of seropositive patients without AIDS, 9 of 32
(28%),exceeded that ofpatients with AIDS, 1of 20 (5%)(p < 0.05). These findings indicate that HIV infects the CNS early in the
course of viral infection and prior to the development of HIV-associated neurologic abnormalities.
