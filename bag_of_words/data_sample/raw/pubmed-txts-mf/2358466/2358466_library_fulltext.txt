Argininosuccinate
synthetase (EC 6.3.4.5) is a urea cycle
enzyme which is expressed at high levels in the liver- of
ureotelic
animals such as man. The enzyme catalyzes the
conversion
of citrulline,
aspartate, and ATP to yield argininosuccinate,
AMP, and pyrophosphate.
Argininosuccinate
synthetase purified from human liver is a cytoplasmic homotetramer with a molecular mass of approximately
180 kDa (1,
2). There is no evidence that the protein undergoes posttranslational
modification.
The cDNA sequence and deduced
amino acid sequence are known for the human, rat, and bovine
enzymes (3-5). There is a single human expressed gene which
maps to chromosome
9q34 on the basis of expression
in
somatic cell hybrids (6) and genetic linkage data (7). The
human gene was reported to contain at least 13 exons (8), and
recent data identified
16 exons.’ Extensive
reviews of the
argininosuccinate
synthetase locus are available and provide
information
on processed dispersed pseudogenes, metabolite
regulation,
and enzyme overproduction
in canavanine-resistant cells (9-11).

deficiency.
The classic neonatal
form is characterized
by
hyperammonemia,
mental retardation,
and early death when
untreated
(9, 12). The enzyme defect is demonstrable
in
cultured skin fibroblasts
and in somatic tissues of these patients. Most patients with neonatal citrullinemia
have complete or near complete enzyme deficiency and develop symptoms during the first few days of life. Rare patients have
milder degrees of enzyme deficiency and later onset of symptoms. A different
late onset form of citrullinemia
has been
described in Japan in association
with decreased enzyme
activity in the liver but normal activity in cultured
skin
fibroblasts; the primary defect in these patients has not been
elucidated
(11). Extensive
analyses of enzyme activity, immunoreactive
protein, mRNA, and genomic DNA have been
performed
using cultured skin fibroblasts or liver specimens
from patients with neonatal
citrullinemia
(9, 13-17). The
majority of patients show very low or undetectable
levels of
cross-reacting
immune material. Southern blotting using the
human cDNA as a probe did not demonstrate
genomic DNA
rearrangements,
but this analysis was hampered by the presence of numerous dispersed processed pseudogenes. Analysis
of mRNA using Northern
blotting and Sl nuclease protection
methods demonstrated
that numerous different
alleles produced mRNA with defects larger than single base changes
(14,16). Other alleles produced mRNA which likely contained
smaller sing1
ase defects since the mRNA fully protected a
cDNA probe %
durl g Sl nuclease digestion. Family studies also
distinguished
a group of alleles which did not produce stable
mRNA (9). Two of the alleles with larger defects in mRNA
have been shown to be caused by genomic deletions resulting
in the absence of exon 5 or 6 in mature stable mRNA (18).
We now report the characterization
of the defect in three
additional
alleles associated with larger defects in mRNA and
in seven alleles associated with single base mutations.

RESULTS
Strategy
and General Observations-First
strand cDNA was
synthesized by reverse transcription of RNA from cultured
skin fibroblasts of patients with citrullinemia. The cDNA for
part or all of the coding region was amplified using the
oligonucleotides depicted in Fig. 1 and the polymerase chain
reaction. In some instances, the size of the PCR product
differed from the normal, and this difference could be localized
to the 5’ half or 3’ half of the molecule. More than one size
of PCR product was present for some patients. The PCR
product was characterized by direct digestion with individual
restriction enzymes known to cut in particular exons of the
cDNA. This preliminary information was correlated with
previous data such as the presence of localized Sl nucleasedetectable defects for particular alleles or patients, previous
evidence of compound heterozygous status, occurrence of
consanguinity, genomic DNA haplotypes, and related information.
The entire coding region was amplified with the SF and TB
oligonucleotides (as identified in Fig. 1) in order to clone the
cDNA into M13mp18 or M13mp19 for sequencing. Individual
Ml3 clones were analyzed by hybridization to Ml3 clones
containing the normal cDNA sequence, and the heteroduplexes were digested with Sl nuclease (data not shown). For
AH, IG, SD, and LP, all cloned inserts were fully protected
from Sl nuclease digestion. For BBr, AC, and CB, all clones
showed a nuclease-detectable defect in the cDNA indicating
a single class of cDNA clones for each patient, although the
defect was different in the three patients. For KSt, RI, GM63,
and BSm, two classes of cDNA clones were identified, one
fully protective and one with a nuclease-detectable defect.
Ml3 clones from GM1679 showed two different nucleasedetectable defects.
Two general observations were made upon sequencing the
cDNA from mutant fibroblasts and control liver. The first
was the absence of sequences for exon 2 in all clones analyzed.
The previously available human cDNA clone for this region
contained sequences derived from exon 2 (3), although there
was indirect evidence that the majority of human mRNA
molecules did not contain the sequences for exon 2 (8). The
clones obtained in the present study provide direct evidence
for the alternative splicing of exon 1 to exon 3 sequences in
human argininosuccinate synthetase transcripts. In addition,
a difference from the published sequence was identified for
nucleotides 973-981 (first nucleotide of initiator codon = +l)

the entire coding region was amplified
using the oligonucleotides
SF

heterozygote) revealed five clones with one mutation, six
clones with the other mutation, one clone with neither mutation, and two clones with both mutations. We believe that
this can be readily explained by the formation of heteroduplexes in late rounds of the DNA amplification when singlestranded products hybridize (29). These heteroduplexes would
undergo mismatch repair after introduction into bacteria during the cloning process. We have observed other evidence of
heteroduplex formation as discussed below.
Sequencing of cDNA clones from nine independent chromosomes with no Sl nuclease-detectable defect allowed the
identification of seven different single base changes associated
with missense mutations (Table I). The mutation G390R was
identified in three separate patients. Six of the seven single
base changes alter a restriction enzyme site. Six of the seven
mutations involved conversion of a CpG dinucleotide to TpG
in one or the other strand of DNA. This would be consistent
with an increased mutation rate due to deamination of 5methylcytosine to form thymidine as has been observed in
other systems and is discussed below. One silent mutation
was observed at histidine codon 167. This residue was encoded
by the triplet CAC in all cases except clones from an allele
with a splicing mutation (to be described below), where CAT
replaced CAC. There was no evidence of second mutations in
a particular allele when the full coding region was sequenced.
Confirmation
of Single Base Changes-Since six of the
seven single base substitutions altered a restriction enzyme
site, it was possible to confirm the mutation by digestion of
amplified cDNA (Table I). In all cases,these analyses involved
digestion of cDNA from multiple independent amplification
reactions. As an example, the loss of the Fnu4HI site in one
of the alleles from KSt is shown in Fig. 3. Amplification of
the 5’ end of the cDNA results in a normal sized product
designated A and a smaller product designated B. The presence of the smaller product is due to an allele which results
in the absence of exon 5 in the mRNA as previously reported
(18). Since the presence of two different amplification products makes it difficult to interpret the digestion analysis, each
PCR product was isolated by electrophoresis in agarose and
digested individually with Fnu4HI (right panel in Fig. 3). The
resulting products are consistent with the absence of exon 5

Trp, and His replacing the previously published sequence of
TTA CGG CCT. Sequencing of the original cDNA clones
during the course of this study confirmed that this discrepancy
was caused by a sequencing error in the original study and
was not related to the fact that the original clones were
isolated from cells which overproduce the enzyme.
Identification of Single Base Changes-Ml3
clones from
alleles producing fully protective mRNA or cDNA sequences
were thought likely to have single base changes which might
be difficult to distinguish from polymerase errors due to the
amplification process. For this reason, a total of five to eight
Ml3 clones derived from two independent amplification reactions was sequenced simultaneously. Single base differences
observed in a single clone were presumed to represent amplification artifacts and were found at a frequency of approximately 1 in 800 nucleotides. For sequencing gels, all lanes for
an individual nucleotide were frequently grouped from a number of clones in order to facilitate rapid identification of
mutations as shown in Fig. 2. The sequences for eight clones
from AH and for four control clones are shown in Fig. 2.
Counting the clones for AH from left to right, a G to A
mutation is seen for clones 2, 3, 5, and 6 at base pair 1087 in
the cDNA sequence. A different C to T mutation is seen for
the same patient in clones 1,4,7, and 8 at base pair 970. The
mutation at base pair 970 resulted in substitution of serine
(AGT) for glycine (GGT) in codon 324 (G324S). The mutation
at base pair 1087 resulted in substitution of tryptophan (TGG)
for arginine (CGG) in codon 363 (R363W). These mutations
resulted in the loss of an MspI restriction site in exon 13 for
G324S and in exon 14 for R363W. Each nucleotide change
was confirmed by sequencing the opposite strand (one out of
five clones had the mutation at base position 970 and four
out of five clones had the mutation at position 1087). The
entire coding region was sequenced using this strategy for all
alleles. In all cases, the data were consistent with the presumption that changes seen in more than a single clone
represented mutations while changes seen in a single clone
represented errors introduced during amplification.
In most caseswhere the patient is a compound heterozygote
with different paternal and maternal alleles, individual clones
contained either one or the other mutation as depicted in Fig.
2. However, the sequencing of clones from IG (a compound

sequences in one allele and with the loss of the Fnu4HI site
in the other allele. The normal sized product (A) from KSt
yields the normal 355-bp product and a 240-bp product which
is the sum of the normal 75 and 165bp fragments.
Patient AH was found to have alleles G324S and R363W,
both of which result in the loss of MspI sites. MspI digestion
of PCR product from the 3’ end of the cDNA demonstrated
a pattern which was consistent with the loss of one or the
other site in a proportion
of the molecules, but a significant
portion of the molecules was not cut at either site. This result
is best explained
by the formation
of heteroduplexes
with
each mutation being present in opposite strands resulting in
the failure of cleavage at either site. No further confirmation
was available for the S180N mutation. All of the other point
mutation alleles were tested in this manner, and the expected
loss of a specific restriction
site in the PCR product was
confirmed.
Confirmation
of two mutations was also carried out using
genomic DNA analysis. Alleles R304W and G324S each result
in loss of an MspI site in exon 13. Amplification
of this exon
from normal DNA using primers in the flanking
introns
results in a 269.bp fragment with two MspI sites as shown in
Fig. 4. Analysis of the family of patient AH (G324S) is shown
on the left of Fig. 4. Patient AH and the father of AH are
each heterozygous
for the G324S mutation
which results in
the diagnostic 127-bp MspI fragment. The fetus in this family
is known to be a non-carrier
for citrullinemia
based on analysis of DNA haplotypes
at the argininosuccinate
synthetase
locus (data not shown). Analysis of the family of RI is shown
on the right side of Fig. 4. Patient RI and the mother of RI

to the sequence contained

DISCUSSION

Analysis of mutations causing citrullinemia is particularly
well suited for amplification of cDNA followed by DNA sequencing. Messenger RNA is present in cultured skin fibroblasts, and previous data indicated that a majority of alleles
produced stable mRNA (14). The relatively small 1240-base
pair coding region is amenable to complete sequencing using
individual clones as performed here or using pools of clones
or direct sequencing of the PCR product. Our experience
demonstrates 1) the feasibility of sequencing a large number
of mutations as part of a single study, 2) the stability of
mutant mRNA even when entire exon sequences are absent,
3) the high frequency with which C to T transitions in CpG
dinucleotides are the basis of missense mutations, and 4) the
extreme heterogeneity of mutations causing neonatal citrullinemia.
What is the evidence that these mutations cause the functional defect in each case? First, the sequencing of multiple
clones and the confirmatory restriction enzyme analyses using
the products of multiple independent amplifications demonstrate that these are not cloning or sequencing artifacts. In
the case of the single base missense mutations, the argument
that these are the causative mutations is based on the fact
that there is abundant mRNA in these cells and that these
G AT
C
were the only mutations found upon sequencing the entire
AG
coding region. In the case of the larger defects in cDNA, there
was a consistent defect in each case, and the large nature of
the defect argues strongly that the absence of all or part of an
exon would disrupt function.
There is extensive evidence for increased mutation at CpG
dinucleotides as a source of DNA polymorphism (30) and as
a cause of disease mutations (31, 32). It is widely accepted
that this is explained by the deamination of 5-methylcytosine
at CpG dinucleotides leading to C to T transitions. This can

sence of exon 7 or 13 for the two alleles described here might
represent genomic deletions or might represent splicing mutations. Using intron probes flanking these exons, no Southern blot abnormalities have been detected in association with
these two mutations. It is interesting to note that the absence
of exon 7 was ascertained in two patients, both times inherited
from a parent of Japanese descent.
Sequence analysis of cDNA from cell line BSm demonstrated the absence of the first seven base pairs of exon 16 in
the cDNA from one allele while the other allele showed a
single G to A mutation and resulted in a glycine to arginine
substitution (G390R) (Fig. 6A). The sequence in the region of
the seven-base deletion suggested the possibility of a splicing
mutation with the use of a cryptic splice site in exon 16. Using
oligonucleotides from intron 15 and exon 16, the genomic
DNA from this region was amplified from BSm and from CG
who had the same defect, the latter presumably being homozygous because of consanguinity (14). Sequencing of the genomic DNA demonstrated a G to C transversion in the last
nucleotide of intron 15 (Fig. 6B). These results are consistent
with a splicing mutation and the use of a cryptic splice site in
exon 16 (Fig. 6C). Translation of the abnormal sequence in
the mRNA would result in the production of an abnormal
protein which would be 25 amino acids longer than the wildtype protein due to a frameshift in the mRNA. The abnormal
protein molecule may be rapidly degraded since cross-reactive

of a citrulline-adenylate covalent complex, and the kinetic
analyses supported the presence of such a complex (51, 52).
Relatively little is known concerning the active site for argininosuccinate synthetase, and the amino acid residues involved in binding of the six substrates and products of the
enzyme are not well defined. Chemical modification studies
demonstrated that cysteine and arginine residues are essential
for catalytic activity (53). There is evidence that specific
arginine residues are involved in the binding of ATP and PPi.
Modification studies indicated that arginine residues 153 and/
or 157 were involved in the binding of ATP (54). These occur
in a region of homology with proposed ATP binding sites for
several enzymes (55). The mutation R157H affects one of
these arginine residues, and it would be of interest to study
the ATP binding properties of this mutant enzyme, perhaps
produced by recombinant methods.

effects. In contrast, rare disorders may not have undergone
enrichment for individual alleles and may be more heterogeneous at a molecular level (42). The extent of inbreeding or
ethnic homogeneity is also a factor as evidenced by gyrate
atrophy of the retina which demonstrates predominant alleles
in the Finnish population but much more extensive heterogeneity outside that population (43). Thus a general rule in
human diseases might be that common recessivedisorders are
likely to be associated with predominant alleles, particularly
within ethnic groups while rare recessive disorders are likely
to be extremely heterogeneous at the molecular level. Exceptions occur where one or two alleles predominate for a rare
disorder as for hereditary fructose intolerance (44). Diseases
occurring predominantly by new mutation such as X-linked
lethal diseases represent a different circumstance with the
expectation of extensive molecular heterogeneity.
One missense mutation reported here (G324S) is one of five
reports where a G to A transition occurs in the last nucleotide
of an exon. Mutations in this position have diverse effects as
they result in amino acid substitutions and/or splicing abnormalities. A mutation at the rosy locus in Drosophila (45), two
mutations in the ornithine transcarbamylase locus (46, 47),
and a mutation in the a-chain of p-hexosaminidase A (48) are
of this type. The G324S mutation causing citrullinemia is
almost exactly analogous to the mutation in the a-chain of flhexosaminidase A except that the phenotype is complete in
citrullinemia as compared with mild in the hexosaminidase
mutation. The amino acid substitution is identical, and the
majority of mRNA is normally spliced in both cases.
There is a high degree (94%) of amino acid identity for
argininosuccinate synthetase between species as diverse as
man (3), cow (5), rat (4), and mouse.3 Thus one might expect
that many mutational events that result in an amino acid
substitution might be detrimental to the enzyme. Among the
missense mutations causing citrullinemia, a number involve
relatively conservative substitutions (G14S, SBON, and
G324S), while others involve nonconservative substitutions
(R157H, R304W, R363W, and G390R) (49, 50). Since Gly
residues do not possess any functional groups and hence do
not participate in the catalytic process, it seems most likely
that these changes result in tertiary alterations of the protein
and thereby disrupt function. The mechanism of action of
argininosuccinate synthetase has been the focus of numerous
investigations. Stable isotope studies indicated the presence
