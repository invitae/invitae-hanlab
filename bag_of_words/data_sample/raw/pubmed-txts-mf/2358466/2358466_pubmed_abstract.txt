Citrullinemia is an autosomal recessive disease caused by deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase. In order to characterize mutations, RNA was isolated from cultured fibroblasts from 13 unrelated patients with neonatal citrullinemia. Ten mutations were identified by sequencing of amplified cDNA. Seven single base missense mutations were identified: Gly14----Ser, Ser180----Asn, Arg157----His, Arg304----Trp, Gly324----Ser, Arg363----Trp, and Gly390----Arg. Six of these missense mutations involved conversion of a CpG dinucleotide in the sense strand to TpG or CpA, and six of the seven mutations alter a restriction enzyme site in the cDNA. Two mutations were observed in which the sequences encoded by a single exon (exon 7 or 13) were absent from the cDNA. One mutation is a G----C substitution in the last position of intron 15 resulting in splicing to a cryptic splice site within exon 16. There is extreme heterogeneity of mutations causing citrulinemia. This heterogeneity may prove typical for less common autosomal recessive human genetic diseases.
