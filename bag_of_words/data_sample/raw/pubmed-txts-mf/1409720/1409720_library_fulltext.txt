Alkaline phosphatases (ALPs) [orthophosphoric-monoester
phosphohydrolase (alkaline optimum), EC 3.1.3.1] are homodimeric or homotetrameric glycoproteins that can hydrolyze a variety of monophosphate esters with high pH optima
(1). In humans there are four isozyme forms of ALP; tissuenonspecific ALP (TNSALP), also known as "liver/bone/
kidney" ALP, placental ALP, intestinal ALP, and placentallike ALP. Each isozyme is encoded by a separate gene (2-5).
Expression of the placental, intestinal, and placental-like
ALPs is limited to a few specific tissues, whereas TNSALP
is present in many cell types and is especially rich in
mineralizing bone (1).
The physiological function of ALP in most tissues is
uncertain; however, the TNSALP isoenzyme has long been
thought to play a role in skeletal mineralization (1, 6-8) and
appears to function at physiologic pH as a cell-surface

phosphatase toward several natural phospho-monoester substrates (8-10). Perhaps the strongest evidence for a role for
TNSALP in skeletal formation is provided by the inbornerror-of-metabolism hypophosphatasia, an inherited metabolic bone disease that is characterized by deficient TNSALP
activity and defective skeletal mineralization (for reviews,
see refs. 8, 10, and 11).
Hypophosphatasia is highly variable in its clinical expression, which ranges from stillbirth with no radiographically
apparent mineralized bone to pathologic fractures not developing until late in adulthood. However, affected siblings are
usually phenotypically similar. Severe forms of the disease,
when manifested at birth (perinatal hypophosphatasia) or
within the first 6 mo of life (infantile hypophosphatasia), are
transmitted in an autosomal recessive fashion. The mode of
inheritance of clinically more mild childhood hypophosphatasia or adult hypophosphatasia is uncertain, and both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant transmission have
been suggested (11). Carriers of the severe forms are clinically normal but often have modestly reduced serum ALP
activity. Like patients, carriers accumulate certain phosphocompounds (phosphoethanolamine, inorganic pyrophosphate, and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate) thought, therefore, to be
natural substrates of TNSALP (8, 12, 13). At least one form
of severe hypophosphatasia, prevalent in the Canadian Mennonite population, has been shown to be tightly linked to the
ALPL locus (14,15), which encodes TNSALP. However, the
only reported molecular defect in hypophosphatasia to date
is our description of an identical single missense mutation in
both alleles of the TNSALP gene in an infant with lethal
hypophosphatasia whose parents are second cousins. This
mutation was shown, by site-directed mutagenesis, to abolish
TNSALP activity and causes perinatal disease in the homozygous state. It has been detected only in members of this
inbred kindred and is not found in 42 other hypophosphatasia
individuals (16). In addition, correct-sized TNSALP mRNA
with abundance within the normal range was found in the
fibroblasts of 13 severe cases of hypophosphatasia (17).
Taken together, these findings were interpreted to predict
that (i) there are at least two different severe hypophosphatasia mutations in the gene for TNSALP, (ii) the variability in
clinical expression of hypophosphatasia probably results
from a variety of TNSALP mutations, and (iii) most cases of
severe hypophosphatasia are likely to be caused by point
mutations or by small deletions in the TNSALP gene (17).
To explore the mutations, inheritance, and markedly variable clinical expression of hypophosphatasia, we analyzed

Hypophosphatasia is a heritable form of rickABSTRACT
ets/osteomalacia with extremely variable clinical expression.
Severe forms are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion;
the mode of transmission of mild forms is uncertain. The
biochemical hallmark of hypophosphatasia is deficient activity
of the tissue-nonspecific isozyme of alkaline phosphatase
(TNSALP). Previously, we demonstrated in one inbred infant
that an identical missense mutation in both alleles of the gene
encoding TNSALP caused lethal disease. We have now examined TNSALP cDNAs from four unrelated patients with the
severe perinatal or infantile forms of hypophosphatasia. Each
of the eight TNSALP alleles from these four individuals contains a different point mutation that causes an amino acid
substitution. These base changes were not detected in at least
63 normal individuals and, thus, appear to be causes of
hypophosphatasia in the four patients. (Two additional base
substitutions, found in one allele from each of the four patients,
are linked polymorphisms.) Twenty-three unrelated patients
(of 50 screened), who reflect the entire clinical spectrum of
hypophosphatasia, possess one of four of the above eight
mutations. In two of these additional patients, mild forms of the
disease are also inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.
Our findings indicate that hypophosphatasia can be caused by
a number of different missense mutations and that the specific
interactions of different TNSALP mutant alleles are probably
important for determining clinical expression. Severe forms,
perinatal and infantile disease, are largely the result of compound heterozygosity for different hypophosphatasia alleles.
At least some cases of childhood and adult hypophosphatasia
are inherited as autosomal recessive traits.

the TNSALP cDNA synthesized from fibroblast RNA of four
unrelated patients (GM4235, GM3859, MW5, and MW10)
with severe (perinatal or infantile) hypophosphatasia. We
identified a different mutation in each of the eight TNSALP
alleles in these four subjects, found two linked polymorphisms in one allele of each patient, and examined the
distribution of these 10 base changes in a relatively large
number of individuals who represented all clinical forms of
hypophosphatasia. 11

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines and Patient Materials. Fibroblast lines from four
severely affected patients, referred to as GM3859, GM4235
(18), MW5, and MW10, were studied. GM3859 was taken from
a girl who died 3 hr after birth. GM4235 was obtained from a
5-mo-old boy who expired at 6 mo of age. MW10 was from a
boy who presented with pneumonia at 6 mo of age and was
found to have rickets that underwent gradual spontaneous
improvement so that, now, at 9 yr of age, he has little bony
deformity. MW5 was obtained at autopsy from an infant girl
who presented at 2 mo of age and died 6 mo later (19). The four
patients all exhibited the clinical, radiologic, and biochemical
abnormalities that typify either perinatal or infantile hypophosphatasia (11). Fibroblast lines GM3859 and GM4235, as
well as GM1571, GM3459, GM3502, GM8690, GM9032,
GM9033, and GM9442 (all from patients who had severe forms
of hypophosphatasia) were purchased from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences Human Genetic Mutant
Cell Repository, Camden, NJ. Peripheral blood or fibroblast
cell lines were also obtained from 39 additional unrelated
hypophosphatasia patients who represented all clinical forms
of the disorder and, in some cases, from their family members.
Most of these individuals were either studied or their clinical
information was reviewed by one of us (M.P.W.), and the form
of hypophosphatasia was assigned according to clinical/
radiologic criteria (11). Among these patients were two siblings, 2 and 31/2 yr old, with classic childhood hypophosphatasia (family Z) and one 65-yr-old woman (family VV) with
typical adult disease (see below). Fibroblast cultures were
established by standard methods (18) and grown as described
(17). All samples were obtained with informed consent.
DNA Analysis. The protein-coding regions of TNSALP
cDNAs were amplified from individual patients as described
(16). Amplified fragments were isolated (16), treated with an
excess of EcoRI, and cloned into the plasmid vector pUC18.
Multiple plasmid clones from each patient were isolated, and
their inserts were transferred to the m13 phage M13mpl9 and
sequenced as described (16). For each patient, the nucleotide
sequences of three independent plasmid clones were determined to distinguish base changes present in their genomic
DNA from base changes introduced during cDNA synthesis
or PCR amplification.
To corroborate that the base changes seen in the cloned
TNSALP cDNA isolates were, indeed, mutations present in
the patient's genome, exon amplification and allele-specific
oligonucleotide hybridization were used to detect base
changes in genomic DNA from patients and available family
members. Specifically, standard methods were used for the
isolation of genomic DNA from peripheral white blood cells
(20). One microgram of genomic DNA served as the template
in an amplification reaction containing AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer/Cetus) (21) and oligonucleotide primers specific for exons 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, or 11. Primer sequences
(19-21 bases in length) were based on the sequence analysis

of the human TNSALP gene (5) and are available upon
request. One-tenth of the amplified DNA was electrophoresed in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted (Mini
Trans-Blot, Bio-Rad) or electrophoresed in 4% 3:1 NuSieve
agarose gel and transferred with capillary action onto ZetaProbe membrane (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Prehybridization was performed for 1.0 hr at
370C in a solution containing 0.5 M NaHPO4 (pH 7.20), 1%
bovine serum albumin, 4% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, denatured
salmon sperm DNA at 50 gg/ml, and polyadenylic acid at 50
/ug/ml (adapted from ref. 22). Each hybridization was done
overnight at 370C after addition of the appropriate 32P-labeled
mutant allele-specific oligonucleotide probe. The specific
sequences for the mutant oligonucleotide probes were as
follows: 274T (exon 3), 5'-AGACCAAGTGCAAGAGA-3';
387T (exon 4), 5'-CGGCTGCCTGCATCCTC-3'; 388C (exon
4), 5'-GGCTGCCCCCATCCTCA-3'; 747A (exon 6), 5'AGACCACAAGATGCC-3'; 796C (exon 6), 5'-CGCCTACCCGCTCATGC-3'; 963C (exon 7), 5'-AACCGAGACACAAGCAC-3'; 1052G (exon 9), 5'-TTCGAGCCGGGGGACAT-3'; 1057C (exon 9), 5'-CCAGGGGCCATGCAG-3';
1309T (exon 10), 5'-ACTGCGGACATTCC-3'; and 1482C
(exon 11), 5'-TGGTGGACATGGTGAG-3'. The underlined
letters indicate the nucleotide changes from the normal
cDNA sequence (23). Membranes were first washed at 37°C
with a solution containing 3.0 M tetramethylammonium chloride, 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA, and 0. 1% SDS
and autoradiographed to confirm the presence of amplified
DNA for all samples. They were then washed in the same
buffer at a temperature empirically determined to discriminate between single-base mismatches (24). The wash temperature necessary for discrimination of each probe was as
follows: 274T, 54.5°C; 387T, 57°C; 388C, 52.50C; 747A, 440C;
796C, 490C; 963C, 450C; 1052G, 500C; 1057C, 450C; 1309T,
45°C; and 1482C, 480C. The blots were autoradiographed for
30 min to overnight at -70°C with an intensifying screen.

RESULTS
Base Changes Detected in Hypophosphatasia Patients.
GM4235 TNSALP cDNA clones contained four single-base
changes in the two TNSALP alleles. These base changes and
the resulting amino acid substitutions are summarized in
Table 1. The base changes at positions 387, 963, and 1052
were found on the same TNSALP allele. This allele was
inherited from the propositus' mother (DNA derived from
fibroblast cell line GM4234), as shown by allele-specific
hybridization in Fig. 1A, whereas the 1057C allele was
inherited from the father (fibroblast cell line GM4236).
GM3859 TNSALP cDNA clones also contained four single-base changes in the two TNSALP alleles. The specific
base changes are summarized in Table 1. The base changes

FIG. 1. (A) Analysis of 387T and 1057C mutation in GM4235 fibroblast DNA and parental DNA. Exons 4 and 9 of the TNSALP gene were
amplified from genomic DNA from patient and parents' fibroblast cell lines and hybridized to allele-specific oligonucleotide probes.
Hybridization results are shown below the pedigree. Solid filling of pedigree symbols indicates presence of the 1057C allele, whereas diagonal
line filling represents the 387T allele. MW12, a fibroblast line from a patient known to have the normal bases at these positions (16), is a negative
control. (B) Analysis of 274T and 1482C mutations in MW10 fibroblast DNA and parental DNA. Exons 3 and 11 of the TNSALP gene were

right-hand diagonal-line filling represents the 1309T allele. GM4235 is a negative control.
at positions %3 and 1052 were those also found in GM4235

(see above).
MW10 cDNAs contained the 963C and 1052G single-base
changes found together in the two patients described above.
The allele containing these base changes also contained a T
C transition at nucleotide position 1482 (Table 1). As
shown by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization (Fig.
1B), the 274T allele was inherited from the propositus' father,
whereas the 1482C allele was inherited from his mother.
MW5, as in each of the three patients described above, also
contains the 963C and 1052G single-base changes together in
one TNSALP allele. On the same allele, a thymine replaces
an adenine at nucleotide 1309 (Table 1). The other MW5 allele
contains a single-base substitution at nucleotide residue 747,
which was inherited from the proposita's mother (Fig. 1C).
The allele carrying the 1309T mutation was inherited from her
father and is also present in her clinically unaffected sister.
Population and Family Studies. To determine whether these
base changes might represent mutations deleterious to the
TNSALP gene function or are common nondeleterious polymorphisms, we used allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, as described above, to examine genomic DNA from
57 to 73 unrelated normal individuals and 42 to 50 nonrelated
patients representing all of the various clinical types of
hypophosphatasia. The base changes 963C and 1052G, found
together in one allele from each of the four hypophosphatasia
fibroblast lines described above, appear to be polymorphic in
both the normal and hypophosphatasia populations. The
frequencies of 963C in the normal and affected populations
that we examined were 0.33 and 0.43, respectively, whereas
1052G was found at frequencies of0.31 and 0.47, respectively
(Table 2). These frequencies do not differ significantly between the normal and hypophosphatasia populations, as
determined by a 2 x 2 contingency analysis with three
degrees of freedom. (For 963C, x2 = 1.25, 0.8 > P > 0.7 and
for 1052G, x2 = 3.15, 0.4 > P > 0.3). In addition, consistent
with the observation that these two base changes are on the
same TNSALP allele in our patients and have also been
reported by others as variant nucleotides in a single human
liver ALP cDNA (25), statistical analysis reveals that these
two polymorphisms are in linkage disequilibrium. In a total of
117 normal and hypophosphatasia individuals examined for
the presence of both base changes, 71 had neither, 41 had
both, 3 had only 1052G, and 2 had only 963C. Therefore, the
association of base 963C with 1052G, which in this study is

due to linkage because these mutations are both found in the
TNSALP gene, is highly significant with P < 0.0005 (analysis
is by 2 x 2 contingency with x2 = %.6), demonstrating the
linkage disequilibrium between these polymorphisms.
With regard to the other eight single-base changes we
detected in the four hypophosphatasia patients, none was
found in normal individuals (Table 2). By their absence in the
normal population and, with only one exception, by the
criterion of evolutionary conservation (see Discussion),
these eight base changes, therefore, appear to be deleterious
mutations that, in combination, can cause severe hypophosphatasia. Henceforth, these eight base changes will be referred to as hypophosphatasia mutations.
We then searched, using allele-specific oligonucleotide
hybridization, for the presence of the eight missense mutations in other hypophosphatasia patients (or in their parents
when patient material was not available). Four of the eight
mutations (387T, 388C, 796C, and 1482C) were not found in
any other hypophosphatasia patient. The remaining four
mutations, however, were all detected in at least one other
unrelated hypophosphatasia individual, as summarized in
Table 2. In one of the families, the propositus had died from
infantile hypophosphatasia and was unavailable for study.
Both of his unrelated parents carry the 1057C allele.

FIG. 2. Pedigree of family Z, showing autosomal recessive inheritance of childhood hypophosphatasia. All family members were
examined for the presence of the 747A (diagonal line filling) and
1057C (solid filling) by oligonucleotide hybridization of allele-specific
probes, the results of which are shown below the pedigree. The
sibling children who display childhood hypophosphatasia are I-1 and
1-2. MW5 and GM4235 each serve as both a positive and negative
control.

Two of these individuals are siblings (Fig. 2, I-1 and I-2 of
family Z) who show the classic phenotype of childhood
hypophosphatasia. All members of the family depicted in the
pedigree were examined for the presence of the 747A and
1057C alleles, and the results are indicated in the pedigree.
The pattern of inheritance shows that the 747A and 1057C
mutations are on different TNSALP alleles and that the
affected individuals are compound heterozygotes for these
two mutant alleles. Carriers in this family report no clinical
signs or symptoms of the disease (M.P.W., data not shown).
Consequently, this family appears to show autosomal recessive inheritance for the relatively mild childhood form of
hypophosphatasia.
The third individual who tests positive for both the 747A
and 1057C mutant alleles is a 65-year-old woman (VV1)
whom we recently diagnosed with adult hypophosphatasia.
This patient is of interest because she, as in -50%o of adult
hypophosphatasia cases (26), recalls having been told she had
rickets as a young child but reported having generally good
health until long bone fractures began during her sixth decade
of life. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to amplified DNAs from the woman, her two sisters, and her
daughter (Fig. 3) indicated that the two TNSALP mutations
are on separate alleles. This woman is, therefore, a compound heterozygote and shows autosomal recessive inheritance for the mild adult form of hypophosphatasia.

DISCUSSION
We have identified 10 additional base changes in the
TNSALP genes of four unrelated patients with perinatal or
infantile hypophosphatasia. Two of these changes, 963C and
1052G, are linked polymorphisms that are common in our
samples of normal and hypophosphatasia individuals. The
remaining 8 base changes, however, are missense mutations
that were not found in any of at least 57 or more subjects
representing the normal population.
Further assessment of these mutations comes from considering the conservation of ALP polypeptides through ev-

olution in light of the three-dimensional structure of Escherichia coli ALP, which has been determined by x-ray crystallography (27, 28). The ALP protein sequences available for
comparison include one from yeast, one from E. coli (29, 30),
two from Bacillus subtilis (31), and ten mammalian ALPs,
both tissue-nonspecific and tissue-specific (4, 23, 32-41).
Three of the eight hypophosphatasia mutations (387T,
388C, and 1309T) result in amino acid substitutions in regions
of the polypeptide that are conserved throughout evolution,
being identical in mammals, yeast, and bacteria (23, 28, 31).
Both the 387T and 388C mutations cause amino acid substitutions at Arg-54 in the mature TNSALP polypeptide. This
residue is within a region of the polypeptide that is involved
in metal-ligand binding. The residue in E. coli analogous to
Asp-361, which is affected by mutation 1309T, corresponds
to a metal-binding ligand. Both amino acid residues affected
by these three mutations are identical in all characterized
ALPs.
Two of the mutations (274T and 796G) affect amino acid
residues that are completely conserved in mammalian ALPs.
Because there is not sufficient homology between TNSALP
and yeast and prokaryotic ALPs in the two corresponding
regions to make direct sequence alignments, we cannot
speculate on the function of these regions of the polypeptide.
For the remaining three mutations (747A, 1057C, and
1482C), the amino acid residues are conserved among all
TNSALPs. Once again, the affected regions of the polypeptide are not conserved among TNSALP and prokaryotic
ALPs, so a direct comparison of amino acid residues again
cannot be made.
The polymorphic 963C base change causes an amino acid
substitution of histidine for tyrosine at amino acid position
246 in TNSALP. Rat intestinal ALP also has a tyrosine
residue at this position. The remaining mammalian ALPs
(except the type 3 allele of human placental ALP, see ref. 34)
have a histidine residue at this position. Finding both tyrosine
and histidine residues in this position in the mammalian ALPs
supports the conclusion, based on population distributions
(see Population and Family Studies above), that the 963C
base change is a functionally silent polymorphism.
The salient features of the eight mutations described herein
are as follows: Mutation 274T was originally detected in a
case of infantile hypophosphatasia (MW10) who has survived
into childhood but was also seen in two other cases of
infantile hypophosphatasia that proved lethal. This mutation
affects an amino acid residue that is conserved in all characterized mammalian ALPs. Mutation 387T was first characterized in a lethal infantile case of hypophosphatasia and
affects a highly conserved and functionally significant amino
acid residue. Mutation 388C was discovered in a lethal
perinatal case of hypophosphatasia and affects a highly

conserved and functionally significant amino acid residue.
Mutation 747A was first found in a case of lethal infantile
hypophosphatasia (MW5) but is also found in mild childhood
and adult forms of hypophosphatasia and can be inherited in
an autosomal recessive fashion in both severe and mild
disease. Mutation 796C was first detected in a lethal perinatal
case of hypophosphatasia and affects a highly conserved
amino acid residue. Mutation 1057C was discovered in a
lethal infantile case of hypophosphatasia but is also found in
mild forms of hypophosphatasia. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion in both severe and mild hypophosphatasia and causes lethal infantile hypophosphatasia when
present in both TNSALP alleles. Mutation 1309T was first
observed in a lethal infantile case of hypophosphatasia, is
found in all clinical forms of hypophosphatasia, and affects a
highly conserved and functionally significant amino acid
residue. Mutation 1482C was first characterized in a surviving infantile case of hypophosphatasia.
Our findings in these four cases of severe hypophosphatasia provide insight concerning a number of aspects of this
inborn error of metabolism and its inheritance. All four of the
patients were compound heterozygotes for TNSALP gene
defects. Thus, the five cases of severe hypophosphatasia
(perinatal and infantile forms) examined to date (see ref. 16
also) have resulted from autosomal recessive inheritance of
a number of different missense mutations at the TNSALP
gene locus. The nine hypophosphatasia point mutations
(including the 711A mutation discussed in ref. 16) are present
in a total of 24 of our 50 patients, with the most prevalent
mutation being found in only 9 patients (1309T). Our pool of
DNA samples from 50 patients contains 100 TNSALP alleles;
we have identified a mutation in 32 of these alleles to date.
Three of the point mutations observed in severe forms of
hypophosphatasia (747A, 1057C, and 1309T) are involved in
the clinically mild childhood and adult forms of the disease.
In two families, one with childhood (family Z) and the other
with adult hypophosphatasia (family VV), affected individuals are compound heterozygotes for the 747A and 1057C
alleles. These families, therefore, show autosomal recessive
inheritance of the same two mutations in mild forms of
hypophosphatasia. Despite their classification as different
forms of the disease by an accepted clinical nosology (11),
these patients appear to have very similar clinical expression
of their disorder. Therefore, longitudinal study of the affected
children in family Z and comparison to the adult patient from
family VV will be important to assess the impact of TNSALP
genotype versus environmental or other genetic factors in
determining the clinical consequences of compound heterozygosity for these two mutations.
Molecular characterization of additional hypophosphatasia
patients, including families in which autosomal dominant
inheritance has been reported (for review, see ref. 42),
together with clinical and biochemical studies, should provide additional insights into the biological function of
TNSALP. Identification of specific causal molecular defects
in the marked varying clinical forms of hypophosphatasia
may also improve the current clinical nosology and enhance
prognostication for this inborn error of metabolism.
