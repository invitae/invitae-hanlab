pBS-ATG (6) a vector that supplies a translation
initiation site. The initiating methionine in pBSATG corresponds to the initiating methionine of the
cDNAs. There are no amino acids derived from the
pBS-ATG vector in the coding sequences. We constructed the plasmids pSV2A-mTFE3-S and
pSV2A-mTFE3-L by insertion of the Hind III-Eco
RI fragment from the pBS-ATG-cDNA vectors that
contained the entirety of the cDNA (2.1 kb) and
inserted them into pSV2A (1, 11) that had been
linearized with Bam HI and Hind III and end-filled.
These vectors drive transcription of the cDNA by

EREDITARY OR FAMILIAL ALZHEImer's disease is an autosomal-dominant form of localized amyloidosis.

Patients with hereditary Alzheimer's disease
typically develop three pathologic lesions: (i)
senile plaques in the cerebral cortex characterized by a central amyloid core surrounded by
dystrophic neurites; (ii) neurofibrillary tangles; and (iii) congophilic angiopathy of the
leptomeningeal vessels. The amyloid deposits
in the senile plaques and in the blood vessel
walls contain a fibril subunit protein of 39 to
43 amino acid residues (1), which is a portion
of the carboxyl terminus of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Sequence analysis of

cDNA clones of APP has shown that there
are multiple forms of mRNA which are the
result of alternate splicing of a transcript from
a single gene (2-5). Although the sequence of
the APP gene from some patients with either
sporadic or familial Alzheimer's disease is
normal (6-8), a missense mutation in the
membrane-spanning domain of the APP gene
has been identified in patients from several
families with familial Alzheimer's disease (9,
10).
We used genomic DNA from three generations of a family with classic early-onset
autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease to
determine whether the disease in this family
is associated with a point mutation in the
APP gene. We amplified and sequenced
exon 15 of the APP gene using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Fig. 1) (7, 9, 11).
Affected members of this family show

and dementia in this kindred. This mutation
is consistent with observations of familial
amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP), in
which multiple single amino acid substitutions are associated with amyloid fibril formation (15). Although the pathogenesis of
disease in systemic amyloidosis is generally
considered to involve the formation of amyloid deposits that lead to destruction of
normal tissue, similar conclusions cannot yet
be drawn for hereditary Alzheimer's disease.
The dementia may be in part the result of
altered function of the variant APP protein
and not the direct result of displacement of
normal tissue by amyloid fibrils.
This amino acid substitution (Val to Phe)
is at the same position in APP as the Val to
Ile substitution found by Goate et al. in
another family with early-onset hereditary
Alzheimer's disease (9). This position is two
residues beyond the carboxyl terminus of
the 1-amyloid peptide subunit isolated from
fibrils. Because the carboxyl terminus of the
,B-amyloid peptide is heterogeneous and the
amyloid protein from neither of the families
found to have mutations at position 1924
has been studied, this amino acid may be
included in the amyloid subunit protein in
these particular kindreds. In any case, this
position in the APP molecule must be important both in the generation of amyloid
fibril deposits and Alzheimer's disease.
Single amino acid substitutions are also
found in other forms of hereditary amyloidosis. In the transthyretin amyloidoses
(FAP, types I and II), a number of single
amino acid substitutions in transthyretin are

Regulation of Transendothelial Neutrophil
Migration by Endogenous Interleukin-8
ANDREAS R. HUBER, STEVEN L. KUNKEL, ROBERT F. TODD, III,
STEPHEN J. WEISS*
Movement of neutrophils from the bloodstream to inflamed tissue depends on the
activation of both the neutrophil and the endothelial cell. Endothelial cells lining the
postcapillary venule respond to proinflammatory mediators by expressing adhesion
molecules and synthesizing a variety of neutrophil-activating factors. Endothelial cell
production of a 77-amino acid variant of interleukin-8 (IL-8) was found to be a
requirement for the invasion of neutrophils through a vessel wall model. IL-8 secreted
by cytokine- or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated endothelial cells induced the rapid shed-

ding of neutrophil lectin adhesion molecule-i, the up-regulation of leukocyte 02
integrins, and the attachment and transmigration of the neutrophils. Thus, endogenous
endothelial IL-8 regulates transvenular traffic during acute inflammatory responses.

to express adhesion molecules that can bind
to circulating neutrophils (1). This initial
adhesive interaction is regulated by a member of the lectin-cellular adhesion molecule
family (lectin adhesion molecule-l;
LECAM-1) that is displayed on the surface
of unstimulated neutrophils (1, 2). Binding
of the neutrophils to the inflamed endothelium then initiates an orchestrated series of
events in which the neutrophils shed
LECAM-1 and engage a second set of adhesion-promoting glycoproteins, the leukocyte P2 integrins (1, 2). The adherent neutrophils then penetrate the vessel wall by
moving between interendothelial-cell junctions and proceeding through the underlying basement membrane into the interstitium (1-3).
The initial interaction between
LECAM-1 on the circulating neutrophil and
the surface of stimulated endothelial cells is
presumed to be a passive event (1, 2). However, the source and identity of the factors

responsible for the initiation of the subsequent shedding of LECAM-1, the up-regulation of the I2 integrins, and neutrophil
diapedesis is unclear. We now show, in a
model of the postcapillary venular wall (3),
that IL-1I3-, TNFa-, or LPS-stimulated endothelial cells actively promote neutrophil
transvenular migration by the synthesis and
release of a 77-amino acid variant of interleukin-8 (IL-877) (4). Although endothelial
IL-877 is thought to be a specific inhibitor of
neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions (5),
we show that this molecule is a primary
promoter of neutrophil diapedesis by virtue
of its ability to both regulate LECAM-1 and
I2 integrin expression and to form a
transendothelial cell chemotactic gradient.
To duplicate the conditions under which
endothelial cells promote transvenular neutrophil migration in vivo, we added IL-11,
TNFa, or LPS to the basilar compartment
of the blood vessel wall construct, and after
a 4-hour incubation, 1 x 106 neutrophils
were added in fresh media to the apical
compartment, and invasion was monitored.
Under these conditions, 79 + 7%, 81 -- 6%,
and 85 _ 8% (± SEM, n = 4) of the added
neutrophils were associated with IL-113-,
INFa-, and LPS-stimulated vessel wall constructs, whereas only 9 ± 3% were associated
with untreated, control cultures (6). After 90
min, almost all of the vessel wall-associated
neutrophils had successfully penetrated the
endothelial layer and invaded the underREPORTS

associated with the amyloid syndrome (15).
Similarly, FAP type HI is associated with
amyloid deposits that contain a peptide of
apolipoprotein Al with a single amino acid
substitution (Gly to Arg) (12). In Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSS), a
hereditary adult-onset dementia with cerebral amyloid plaques composed of a fragment of the prion protein, every GSS family
studied to date has a mutation in the gene
coding for this protein (16-18). Hereditary
cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis in
Icelandic kindreds (HCHWA-I) is associated with a single amino acid substitution in
cystatin C (19), and a similar syndrome in
Dutch kindreds (HCHWA-D) is associated
with a single amino acid substitution of Gln
for Glu in APP (20).
Although other single amino acid substitutions in APP may be associated with amyloid deposits and Alzheimer's disease, it is
unlikely that single amino acid substitutions
in APP can explain all sporadic forms of
Alzheimer's disease. Recently it has been
proposed that in some cases of FAP, normal
transthyretin may form amyloid deposits in
association with unknown aging factors
(21). Similarly, in Alzheimers disease, different pathogenic processes may lead to a
common clinical presentation.
