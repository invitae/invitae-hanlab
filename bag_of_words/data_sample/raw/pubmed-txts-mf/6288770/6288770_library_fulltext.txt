A B S T R A C T Cultured skin fibroblasts were obtained
from two siblings with classic clinical features of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Plasma cholesterol values were 970 and 802 mg/100 ml in the
siblings, 332 mg/100 ml in the mother, and 426 mg/
100 ml in the father. Fibroblast receptor-specific capacity for binding and degradation of '25I-low density
lipoprotein (LDL) at 370C was 11% of normal, consistent with the diagnosis of "homozygous LDL receptor-defective" hypercholesterolemia, a disorder in
which LDL binding activity is low but detectable.
The residual LDL receptor activity was clearly qualitatively abnormal. The Michaelis constant (Ki) for
'25I-LDL was reduced to 20-40% of normal, indicating
a substantially increased affinity for LDL. Increased
affinity and reduced capacity for 125I-LDL are also
found when normal fibroblasts are assayed at 4°C. As
the temperature is raised to 37°C surface LDL binding
affinity decreases while capacity increases. At 40C the
fibroblasts of our subjects had an affinity for LDL indistinguishable from normal cells assayed at that temperature and a binding capacity 23% of normal. However, only small changes in affinity and capacity occurred upon increasing the temperature to 370C.
When 125I-apoprotein E-phospholipid vesicles were
bound at 370C the receptor deficiency appeared only
half as severe as when '251-LDL was used as ligand.
A family study suggests that the siblings are genetic
compounds rather than homozygotes, having inherited
a mutant maternal gene causing absent or silent LDL
receptors and a mutant paternal gene resulting in qualitatively altered LDL receptors. It is not clear whether

these defects are present at the same or different genetic loci. The altered receptors are characterized by
increased affinity and moderately reduced capacity for
LDL at 37°C and are accompanied by hypercholesterolemia at least as severe as that associated with familial hypercholesterolemia with absent or nonfunctional LDL receptors.
INTRODUCTION

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)' is associated with
decreased activity of specific cell low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (1, 2). The illness is most consistent with an autosomal dominant trait; persons with
one abnormal gene have plasma cholesterol levels of
'-350 mg/100 ml and persons with two abnormal
genes have values >600 mg/100 ml (3). The latter
individuals are often termed homozygotes, but it
should be recognized that the abnormal genes might
not be identical or even allelic.
Homozygous hypercholesterolemia has been classified on the basis of 1251-LDL binding to skin fibroblasts
(3, 4). In most instances (60%) practically no LDL
binding was seen and the patients were designated
LDL receptor-negative. One patient was a genetic
compound possessing one allele determining absent
receptors and another determining receptors that
could bind LDL but not be internalized (5). However,
-40% of homozygotes exhibited definite LDL recep' Abbreviations used in this paper: apo, apoprotein;

tor activity that was as much as 20 or 30% of normal
and were designated LDL receptor-defective, even
though no qualitative receptor abnormality was shown
(3, 4, 6). Very little is known about the receptor-defective state. The nature of the residual LDL binding
has not been characterized and family studies have not
been reported.
We recently studied skin fibroblasts from two LDL
receptor-defective siblings with classic clinical features of homozygous FH and their heterozygous parents. LDL receptor activity was determined by the
binding of 125I-LDL to the cells and analyzed to compute receptor-specific binding affinity and capacity.
The results demonstrate a qualitative as well as a quantitative abnormality in LDL receptors and suggest that
these apparent homozygotes are genetic compounds.

cellular) LDL was determined by dissolving the cells in
0.625 N NaOH. From the reaction medium noniodide 10%
trichloroacetic acid soluble degradation products of '251-LDL
were prepared and mixed immediately with an equal volume
of 1.0 N NaOH (9). Results are expressed as nanograms t251_
LDL/milligram cell protein±SE. All experiments were performed in triplicate wells with and without a 10-fold or
greater excess of unlabeled LDL. Values presented are receptor-specific, i.e., the difference of 1251-LDL receptor activity in the absence and presence of excess unlabeled LDL.
Nonspecific binding was <14% of total binding in normal
cells, <28% in the FH siblings' cells, and <34% in the LDL
receptor-negative homozygote cells. In experiments done at
4°C the cells were cooled 40 min before addition of MEM
+ 10% LPDS without bicarbonate buffered with 25 mM
Hepes pH 7.3 containing 1251-LDL and incubated for 2 h.
Apoprotein (apo) E was prepared from pheresis plasma very
low density lipoprotein (VLDL) of an unrelated patient with
type IIA hyperlipoproteinemia. Lyophilized VLDL was delipidated with 2:1 chloroform:methanol and the apo E purified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12). The apo E was reduced and alkylated with
iodoacetamide (13) and then iodinated with Bolton-Hunter
reagent (14) and exhaustively dialyzed against 0.15 M NaCl
containing 10 mM tris-Cl and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.6 (vesicle
buffer). 10 mg dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) was
dissolved in 1 ml benzene and lyophilized and, on the day
of the experiment, 1 ml vesicle buffer was added and the
mixture sonicated for 40 min in a water bath at room temperature with the microtip of a Fisher Scientific Co. (Pittsburgh, PA) model 300 sonic dismembrator. Such treatment
yields vesicles with a distribution coefficient of 0.4 when
chromatographed on Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Vesicles were added to '25I-apo
E in a weight ratio of 3.75:1 and incubated at room temperature 2 h. Apo E-DMPC vesicles bound to LDL receptors
with Michaelis constant (Km) 0.21 gg/ml and Bmax (maximum binding capacity) 13.1 ng/mg when assayed at 4°C
as described (15).
The incorporation of [3H]oleic acid into cholesteryl oleate
was determined by a modification of the method in Fig. 4
of reference 4. [3H]Oleic acid (New England Nuclear, Boston, MA and Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL) was
repurified by chromatography in petroleum ether over a 0.3ml silicic acid (Sil-R, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO)
column (16) and eluted with 10% diethyl ether in petroleum
ether to remove contaminants migrating near cholesteryl
oleate in thin-layer chromatography. Fibroblasts in logarithmic growth were treated for 24 h with 10% lipoprotein
deficient serum and then received either 200 gg/ml LDL
protein or 5 gg/ml 25-OH-cholesterol and were incubated

METHODS
Patients. Fasting cholesterol and triglyceride values (7)
for the hypercholesterolemic siblings and their parents are
shown in Table I. The children have been the subjects of
previous reports (8-10). Hypercholesterolemia (type IIA)
appears in both paternal and maternal lineages as an apparent autosomal dominant trait. The father has tendon xanthomas and the older homozygote has cutaneous and tuberous xanthomas. Skin fibroblasts from the older child have
been classified as LDL receptor-defective by Dr. J. Goldstein
and Dr. M. Brown. LDL receptor-negative skin fibroblasts
(line GM 1915 and GM 2000) were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD.
Assays. Scapular or deltoid area skin fibroblasts were explanted, cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium
(MEM) containing 15% fetal bovine serum or newborn calf
serum and antibiotics, and assayed for '251-LDL binding as
previously described (9, 11, 22). Cells were plated at 105
cells/35-mm well in six-well plastic clusters. After 3-5 d the
medium was removed, the cells were washed twice, and 1
ml MEM containing 10% lipoprotein-deficient human serum
(LPDS) was added. After 3 d of LDL receptor induction, the
medium was aspirated and replaced with 0.7 ml of the same
medium containing 2.5-100 ug/ml 1251-LDL protein (20-60
cpm/ng) with and without a 10-fold or greater excess of
unlabeled LDL. The cells were incubated 5 h at 37°C, the
medium was removed, and the cells were placed on ice and
washed. Cell-surface-bound 1251-LDL was eluted for 1 h into
10 mg/ml heparin on 4 mg/ml dextran sulfate in Puck's
saline G (9, 11, 22). The remaining cell-associated (intra-

the points to a straight line by the method of least squares.
The slope of the line is -1/Km and the abscissa intercept is
the maximum capacity. Although originally described for
analysis of the equilibrium binding of ligands to macromolecules (where there is no internalization or degradation
of ligand), the Scatchard plot also has been shown to be
applicable to kinetic analyses that follow Michaelis-Menten
theory (18). It has the advantage of more easily detecting
deviations from linearity than the more traditional Lineweaver-Burk plot. A Km rather than a dissociation constant
(KD) is computed from the plot, reflecting the internalization
and degradation of LDL.

washed six times with 0.15 M NaCl, scraped from the dish,
and sedimented in 1.5-ml capped plastic tubes. The tritium
counts in cholesteryl oleate were extracted from the cell
pellet into 1 ml 2:1 chloroform:methanol containing 10 jg
unlabeled cholesteryl oleate, isolated by thin-layer chromatography, and corrected for procedural losses incurred
in parallel tubes containing cholesteryl-[3H]oleate.

RESULTS
LDL binding of the homozygotes' fibroblasts. Receptor-specific '25I-LDL processing by skin fibroblasts
from FH homozygote 2 was compared with that of
cells from a normal and a previously classified LDL
receptor-negative homozygote. The dose-response
curves shown in Fig. 1 A, C, E demonstrate that receptor-specific surface bound, internalized, and degraded '25I-LDL at saturating concentrations of 1251_
LDL was markedly reduced in both the affected cell
strains. However, careful examination of the figures
reveals that homozygote 2 was clearly different from
the receptor-negative homozygote. At low '251-LDL
concentrations (<15 ,g/ml) homozygote 2 had surface
binding 69% of the normal cell strain, internalization
35% of normal, and degradation 36% of normal,
whereas it was difficult to detect activity in the receptor-negative cells.
The meaning of these observations can best be appreciated from linearizing Scatchard plots (Fig. 1 B,
D, F). The intercept on the abscissa is the maximum
specific binding capacity and there was little difference between the two FH homozygotes. The slope of
the plots indicates the affinity of LDL binding. The
cells of homozygote 2 showed increased affinity for

surface-binding of LDL and, to a lesser degree, for
internalization and degradation of LDL when compared with normal cells.
The fibroblasts of the FH children were compared
with control strains from seven normolipidemic individuals (Table II). In all experiments the cells of the
homozygous siblings were indistinguishable. Receptorspecific Km and maximum capacity were determined
for heparin-releasable surface '251-LDL binding, intracellular 125I-LDL remaining after heparin treatment, and 125I-LDL degradation. The Km for heparinreleasable '251-LDL binding to the siblings' cells was
20.0% of control, the Km for intracellular LDL accumulation was 37.6%, and the Km for degradation was
39.6% of expected. Hence, all manifestations of 1251._
LDL processing by the children's cells had increased
affinity for 1251-LDL. The maximum capacity for 125I1
LDL was severely reduced (heparin-releasable 125ILDL binding 11%; intracellular LDL, 12%; and degraded LDL, 11% of normal). Kinetics of LDL processing did not resemble those of two receptor-negative cell strains or of normal cells suppressed by growth
in serum (which contains LDL). In the latter cases Km
for binding appeared to be increased.

"I5-LDL binding was determined at either 37°C (first 6 columns) or 4°C (last 2 columns). Fibroblasts were incubated at 370C for 5 h
with '25I-LDL and binding and degradation parameters were calculated. Suppressed normal cells were grown in MEM + 15% fetal
bovine serum instead of 10% LPDS and were washed twice with saline G just before addition of lnI-LDL medium. In other experiments
fibroblasts were cooled at 4°C for 45 min, incubated at 4°C with '25I-LDL for 2 h, and the washed cells were dissolved in NaOH for
counting. All values are receptor-specific (i.e., the '25I-LDL binding or degradation seen in the presence of a 10-fold or greater excess
of unlabeled LDL has been subtracted). Parentheses contain the number of different individuals from which cell strains were derived.
Analyses were performed using triplicate wells with or without unlabeled LDL at '25I-LDL concentrations from 1 to 120 ,ug/ml and the
means of computed parameters from the seven normal cell types or from two to three experiments of individual cell types were
averaged±SEM. Correlation coefficients of Scatchard plots were >0.90 except for LDL receptor-negative cells, where correlation coefficients as little as 0.75 were seen owing to the small amount of binding.

type might have resulted from the inheritance of two
different mutant genes. Fig. 2 shows a Scatchard analysis of '25I-LDL binding in cells from the parents and
a normal subject. 125I-LDL binding capacity (the xintercept) was reduced by 41% in the mother but only
by 18% in the father compared with the normal. The
slope of the Scatchard line was similar in the
normal (-0.0378±0.0033 SD) and the mother (-0.0399
±0.0040), but was significantly different in the father
(-0.0719±0.9900, P < 0.05). The Km computed from
these slopes are: normal, 25.6 Ag/ml; mother, 25.1
gg/ml; and father, 13.9 gg/ml. The mother, therefore,
appears to be a receptor-negative heterozygote, having
half the expected number of normal receptors. However, the father's cells had only modest reduction in
receptor number and increased affinity for LDL. The
near normality of the father's 125I-LDL binding capacity was confirmed by an indirect assay, the ability
of LDL to stimulate the esterification of cellular cholesterol with [3H]oleic acid. Table III (column b) shows
that all cell types demonstrated about equal amounts
of cholesterol esterification in response to 25-OH-cholesterol, which does not require the LDL receptor (4).
However, in response to LDL (column a) the fibroblasts of sibling 1 and the mother had reduced esterification similar to previous reports for FH homozygotes and heterozygotes (3, 4), whereas the father's
cells demonstrated 2.8 times the cholesterol esterification of the mother's cells (column c). This assay is

conducted under conditions for which the regulation
of cell cholesterol esterification by LDL is not at equilibrium.
Characterization of LDL binding in the homozygotes. '25I-LDL binding can be assayed at 4°C, a condition under which normal cells demonstrate a markedly reduced Km for binding and reduced surface
binding capacity (1). This observation is confirmed in
Table II if one compares heparin-releasable surface
binding at 37°C to total binding at 4°C (internalization
and degradation do not occur at 4°C). At 4°C the Km
of normal cells was reduced to 15% of the mean 37°C
Km and the binding capacity was reduced to 32% of
the 37°C binding capacity. The cells of the siblings
did not show such marked changes at 4°C, however.

Triplicate dishes of cells were incubated for 4 h in air with MEM
containing 5% LPDS, 25 mM Hepes pH 7.4, and 100 tsg/ml 125ILDL with or without 1 mg/ml unlabeled LDL. After washing at
40 the heparin-releasable surface '25I-LDL was eluted for 1 h at
40C.

The Km at 4°C was 56% of the 37°C Km and the binding capacity at 4°C was 65% of the 37°C binding capacity. Thus, the expected decreases in Km and LDL
binding capacity on cooling were blunted and the siblings' cells appeared much more normal at 4°C than
at 370C. At 40C the Km was not different from normal
and the binding capacity averaged 23% of the normal
(compared with 10.9% of normal at 37°C). This was
confirmed in Table IV in which cells from family
members and a different normal have been analyzed
for '251-LDL heparin-releasable surface binding at 4
and 370C simultaneously using a saturating amount
of 125I-LDL. The specific binding of the siblings' cells
averaged 49% of normal at 40C and was equal to that
of the mother's, whereas at 37°C the siblings' cells
bound half the LDL of the mother's cells and only 22%
of this normal. The ratio of 37°C:4°C binding was 2.89
in normal cells and 2.87 in the mother's, but was reduced to 1.30 in the siblings' and to 2.44 in the father's
cells.
Calcium sensitivity of LDL binding, an index of
receptor specificity, appeared to be similar in normal
and homozygote 1 fibroblasts. Cells were cooled to 40C
for 45 min and washed twice with 0.1 M NaCl containing 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.05 M tris-Cl, pH 7.5.
Incubation at 4°C for 1 h in the same medium containing 10 sg/ml 125I-LDL±3 mM CaCl2±200 ,ug/ml
unlabeled LDL revealed that specific dextran sulfatereleasable surface binding was reduced to 16% of expected in normal cells and 14% of expected in the cells
of homozygote 1. Homozygote 1 cells were also repressed by sterols. When cells were preincubated for
48 h in MEM + 10% LPDS containing 0.01 ,ug/ml 25hydroxycholesterol and 12 ,ug/ml cholesterol and then
washed and incubated for 5 h at 370C with 5 jg/ml
828

'251-LDL+1 mg/ml unlabeled LDL, the specific
dextran sulfate-releasable '251-LDL declined from
12.6±0.71 to 1.96±0.44 ng/mg, similar to the percentage decrease of normal cells.
Because reduced receptor capacity could be due to
increased catabolism as well as decreased synthesis of
receptors, the survival of receptors in the presence of
0.5 mM cycloheximide was studied. When fibroblasts
were incubated in 10% LPDS for 48 h and then treated
with cycloheximide for 10 h, a 61±2% decrease of heparin-releasable LDL binding to normal cells and a
47±10% decrease of heparin-releasable binding to homozygote 1 cells resulted, indicating that increased
receptor catabolism in the mutant cells is unlikely.
Modification of LDL arginine residues with cyclohexanedione greatly reduces the binding of that LDL
to fibroblasts (19). As seen in Table V, modification of
LDL with cyclohexanedione severely reduced the capacity to compete with 125I-LDL for receptor binding
in both normal and homozygote cells.
Vesicle binding. Innerarity et al. (14) reported that
semisynthetic lipoprotein particles made from apo E
and DMPC (apo E-DMPC vesicles) bind with increased affinity to the LDL receptor of cultured fibroblasts. It was concluded that individual vesicles
bind to multiple LDL receptors (15, 20). We tested
this unusual binding property on cells from a normal
and homozygote 1 (Table VI). At saturating amounts
of lipoprotein the surface bound 1251-LDL in the homozygote cells was 24% of that of a simultaneously
analyzed control. However, the surface binding of 125I1

DISCUSSION

Fig. 1 demonstrates that fibroblasts from FH patients
have a small but definite amount of 125I-LDL binding
and degradation that is displaced by unlabeled LDL
(receptor specific). There was little difference in the
maximum specific capacity for LDL binding and degradation between the cells of an LDL receptor-negative homozygote and the siblings, but there was a striking difference in the Km for binding (Fig. 1, Table II).
The Km of the siblings for 1251-LDL heparin-releasable
surface binding was 20.0% of normal, the Km for internalization of LDL was 37.6% of normal, and the Km
for LDL degradation was 39.6% of normal (Table II),
indicating a substantial increase in affinity for LDL.
The most likely explanation for a simultaneous reduction in both Km and maximum capacity for 125I-LDL
surface bound, internalized, and degraded is increased
affinity and reduced capacity of the LDL receptor itself.
The cells of the FH siblings at 37°C most resemble
normal cells that have been cooled to 40C, because at
40C both the Km and capacity for surface binding were
significantly reduced in normal cells (Table II). When
the siblings' cells were cooled to 40C before '251-LDL
binding, the reduction in Km and binding capacity was
greatly blunted (Table II). When both cell types were
assayed at 4°C there was no difference in the Km for
1251-LDL binding and the capacity for binding averaged 23% of normal compared with 11% of normal at
370C (Table II). Hence, the transition in LDL binding
characteristics that normally takes place on warming
from 4 to 370C did not occur in the siblings' cells.
Further evidence for a qualitative LDL receptor
abnormality is provided by '251-apo E-DMPC vesicle
binding data (Table VI). In both normal and homozygote 1 fewer apo E-DMPC vesicles than LDL particles bound to receptors, as expected (15). However,
the ratio of LDL particles:apo E-DMPC vesicles bound
was 4.30 in normal cells and only 1.69 in homozygote
1 cells. Thus, the homozygote cells recognized apo EDMPC vesicles more efficiently than expected and had
only a 40% reduction in apo E-DMPC vesicle binding
(compared with a 76% reduction in LDL binding for
the same normal). But despite clear differences from
normal receptors, the patients' receptors were sensitive
to calcium, had an appropriate rate of catabolism after
addition of cycloheximide, suppressed on addition of
exogenous sterols, and accurately discriminated arginine-modified LDL (Table V).

Fibroblasts were prepared by incubation in MEM + 10% LPDS
as described in Methods and three to six well replicates were incubated for 5 h at 370C with the indicated concentrations of '25Ilabeled lipoproteins+a 20-fold (1'2I-LDL) or 100-fold (l25I-apo EDMPC vesicles) excess unlabeled LDL. The cells were washed and
surface binding was then determined using a 1-h incubation with
30 mg/ml sodium polyphosphate (Sigma type II, practical grade)
in saline G pH 7.4. Particles of lipoprotein bound were computed
from the data of this table assuming 600,000 g protein/mol and
148,000 g protein/mol in LDL and apo E-DMPC vesicles, respectively (15). The values were determined in a single experiment to
minimize interassay variation in LDL receptor expression.

The molecular explanation of increased affinity and
reduced capacity for LDL observed in our patients is
not known, but several interpretations are possible:
(a) a structural mutation or modification of the LDL
receptor causes unusual receptor binding properties;
(b) a defect of the cell membrane or the cytoskeleton
alters receptor activity; (c) the LDL receptors are
structurally normal but are aggregated such that one
LDL particle binds to several receptors, thus reducing
the binding capacity but increasing the binding affinity. The latter possibility is attractive because the increased affinity and reduced capacity seen in the FH
siblings are very reminiscent of the binding characteristics of apo E-high density lipoprotein (HDL)C to
normal fibroblasts at 37°C (20, 21). Apo E-HDLC is an
abnormal lipoprotein containing only the E apoprotein, which binds to more than one LDL receptor site,
effectively cross-linking them. Affinity for apo EHDLC is increased 22-fold, whereas binding capacity
is reduced to 25% of expected, both effects are probably the result of binding to multiple receptors (15).
In our patients, aggregation of the receptors could explain the increased affinity and reduced capacity for
LDL observed as well as the much greater deficiency
of LDL binding than of apo E-DMPC vesicle binding
(Table VI). The latter would be expected if LDL

be further cross-linked by apo E-DMPC vesicles. However, direct evidence for receptor aggregation is
lacking.
Homozygous FH is usually thought to be due to inheritance of two genes specifying absent LDL receptors. In the case of the siblings the data is best explained
by inheritance of two different genes, one resulting is
absence of half the LDL receptors (an LDL receptornegative heterozygote) and one specifying a reduced
number of qualitatively abnormal receptors. Fig. 3
demonstrates that the mother had about half the expected '25I-LDL binding but a normal Km and appeared to be a typical LDL receptor-negative heterozygote. The father had only an 18% reduction in 1251_
LDL binding and a Km reduced to 52% of -expected.
Unpublished studies on two affected heterozygous
members of the father's kindred show similar results.
As assessed indirectly by the ability of LDL to stimulate fibroblast cholesterol esterification (Table III),
the father had much less reduction in LDL receptor
function than the mother. In addition, the father's cells
had a decreased ratio of '251-LDL binding at 37°:4°C
as did his children (Table IV). Despite the mild nature
of the LDL binding defect, his plasma cholesterol was
426 mg/100 ml (Table I) and tendon xanthomas were
present. Likewise, the older sibling has shown no consistent lowering of plasma cholesterol despite treatment with colestipol, nicotinic acid, and sitosterol, and
he appears to be as severely affected as reported LDL
receptor-negative homozygotes (3). Whether or not the
two hypercholesterolemia genes possessed by the siblings are allelic cannot be determined from the present
data.
These results provide direct evidence for the association of clinically important hypercholesterolemia
with a qualitative as well as quantitative abnormality
of LDL receptors. They define the specific LDL binding characteristics of fibroblasts from one form of
".receptor-defective" FH. It is likely that this category
is heterogeneous and that careful study of LDL receptor characteristics might lead to further insights as
to the etiology of this illness.
