A four-layer radioimmunoassay (RIA) using polystyrene beads as the solid phase, anti-rota guinea pig IgG as primary antibody, anti-rota rabbit IgG as secondary antibody, and 125I-labelled sheep anti-rabbit immunoglobulin as indicator antibody has been developed for the detection of human rotavirus in stool specimens. A comparison was made of the developed RIA, routine electron microscopy, and research electron microscopy of 147 unconcentrated stool specimens from patients with infantile gastroenteritis. In routine electron microscopy 17 (11.6%) false-positive or false-negative results were obtained when compared with research electron microscopy. Each specimen positive in research electron microscopy was positive in RIA, and six additional RIA positives were found from 58 electron microscopy negative specimens. A confirmatory test was necessary to find out marginally positive but nonspecific reactions in RIA. The developed radioimmunoassay is slightly more sensitive than research electron microscopy of unconcentrated stool specimens and considerably more sensitive and more specific than routine electron microscopy.
