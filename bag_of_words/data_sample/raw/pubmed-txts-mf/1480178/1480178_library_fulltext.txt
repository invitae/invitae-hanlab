Mutations of the human androgen receptor (AR)
gene impair normal sexual differentiation and development in karyotypic males, resulting in a spectrum of external genital phenotypes ranging from
complete female to nearly complete male. Identification and characterization of these mutations can
provide valuable information regarding the functional importance of specific amino acids of the AR.
To screen for point mutations in the AR gene underlying the phenotypic abnormalities in the androgen
insensitivity syndrome (AIS), the eight exons of the
AR gene were amplified from genomic DNA using
the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analyzed
by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. A computer program, MELTMAP, was used to identify optimum sequences for denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and mutation detection sensitivity was
enhanced by forming heteroduplexes between control and subject PCR products to create base mismatches. In seven families with complete AIS, single
base mutations were found in the region of the AR
gene encoding the steroid-binding domain of the
receptor. The mutations that converted amino acid
774 from Arg to His and amino acid 864 from Asp to
Gly were recreated using site-directed mutagenesis
and the mutant ARs expressed in COS 7 and CV1
cells. In both cases, abnormalities of androgen binding and transcriptional activation were consistent
with the observed sex phenotype. These results
together with others reported previously demonstrate that single amino acid changes within the
region encoded by exons D to H of the AR gene can

alter androgen binding and are a common cause of
complete androgen resistance. The strategy used
herein, employing denaturing gradient gel analysis
of heteroduplex PCR products, provides a valuable
aid to rapid detection of single base mutations in
AIS. (Molecular Endocrinology 6: 1909-1920, 1992)

INTRODUCTION
The androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is an Xlinked disorder in which genetic males fail to undergo
normal fetal masculinization or pubertal virilization (1 ).
In 46,XY individuals, AIS results in a spectrum of abnormalities in masculine development, the most extreme being the complete female phenotype. Identification of molecular defects underlying the clinical disorders in AIS has recently been the target of extensive
investigation (2-4). It has become clear that a wide
variety of androgen receptor (AR) gene mutations underlie the heterogeneity in phenotypic expression of
AIS. Complete or partial AR gene deletions are an
uncommon cause of AIS, accounting for up: to 10% of
cases (5-8). Single base mutations in the coding region
of the AR gene can result in altered amino acid sequence (4, 9-11 ), introduction of a premature termination codon (3, 12, 13), or altered mRNA splicing (14).
For rapid detection of single base mutations in the AR
gene of subjects with complete AIS, we have used a
strategy based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of DNA fragments amplified from genomic
DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
The DGGE method is based on the melting properties
of DNA under denaturing conditions (15). As a DNA

fragment migrates through an increasing concentration
of denaturants (such as formamide and urea), the low
temperature melting domains within it undergo strand
separation to produce partially denatured molecules
with altered electrophoretic mobility. The melting temperature (Tm) of a domain reflects both its base composition and its nucleotide sequence, such that it .can
be altered by a single base change. DGGE is sensitive
only to base changes within the low Tm domains; however, melting characteristics of the DNA can be modified
by the addition of a GC-rich sequence at one end (GC
clamp) (16). This GC clamp becomes the highest Tm
domain of the molecule, thus preventing complete
strand separation and allowing detection of base
changes throughout the DNA sequence (17, 18). Formation of heteroduplex molecules by combining mutant
PCR product with wild-type product results in a nucleotide mismatch that enhances the sensitivity of DGGE,
allowing detection of virtually all single base mutations
(19). Similarly, heterozygous carriers are readily identified with DGGE analysis by the presence of both mutant
and wild-type alleles that form heteroduplexes during
PCR amplification of genomic DNA. Our results highlight the importance of predetermining DNA-melting
properties by computer analysis and demonstrate the
utility of heteroduplex analysis in the detection of some
single base changes.
Using this strategy, single base mutations were detected in the AR gene of members of seven unrelated
families with complete AIS. Androgen binding in genital
skin or testicular fibroblasts was defective in the four
subjects analyzed; however, immunostaining revealed
the presence of AR in fibroblast nuclei. Two of the
mutations found were recreated by site-directed mutagenesis, and the expressed mutant AR proteins were
defective in androgen binding and transcriptional activation. Identification of naturally occurring mutations in
the AR gene in AIS provides valuable information regarding the functional importance of specific amino
acids in the AR.

RESULTS
Prediction of the Melting Behavior of Amplified AR
Gene Fragments
The 11 pairs of oligonucleotide primers used in amplification of the eight exons of the coding region of the AR
gene are shown in Table 1. Exons 8 through H were
each amplified using a single pair of primers with sequence derived from the flanking introns (2). The first
exon (exon A) required four pairs of overlapping primers
for optimal amplification, due to its large size and the
presence of repeated sequences. Using the MELTMAP
program prepared by Lerman and Silverstein (20), melting maps (Tm vs. nucleotide sequence) for each amplified product were used to predict optimal PCR primer
location and determine gradient conditions for DGGE
analysis. The addition of a GC-rich sequence (GC-

VUI O l',IU, 11

clamp) to one end of the 5' -oligonucleotide primers
modified the melting maps, such that all mutations
within the coding regions were theoretically detectable
by DGGE (19). Positioning of some primers for PCR
amplification altered the melting behavior of the PCR
product. As shown in Fig. 1A, when the 5' -primer for
amplification of exon D was located at position D1, 135
basepairs (bp) 5' of the intron-exon junction, the amplified product did not form a sharp band on a denaturing
gradient gel (Fig. 18). The melting map for this amplification product indicates that the lowest melting domain
is bounded on either side by regions of higher melting
temperature (Fig. 1C), a situation known to cause diffuse bands on DGGE (21). However, amplification using
primer D3 (Fig. 1D) positioned 96 bp closer to the intronexon junction resulted in a single low temperature melting domain (Fig. 1F) and resolution of mutant and wildtype alleles by DGGE (Fig. 1 E).

Identification of AR Gene Mutations
Agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide
staining of amplified AR gene exons from nine subjects
with complete AIS (including two pairs of affected siblings) revealed no major deletion. To screen for single
base mutations, amplified exons were further analyzed
by DGGE. Figure 2A illustrates analysis of exon G from
two siblings with complete AIS, their mother, and an
unrelated control (Table 2, subjects 5a and 5b). PCR
products of the affected siblings (lanes 2 and 3) showed
altered electrophoretic mobility compared with the control (lane 4). The mother (lane 1), an obligate carrier
heterozygous for mutant and normal alleles of the AR
gene, displayed four DNA bands. One band comigrated
with the normal allele, and a second band with the
mutant allele of her two affected children. Two upwardshifted bands represent heteroduplexes formed between wild-type and mutant alleles. Heteroduplex formation occurs during PCR when the subject is heterozygous because double stranded DNA products are
separated and reannealed during thermal cycling, thus
allowing reassortment of the DNA strands from different
alleles. These heteroduplexes melt at a higher position
in the gel because they are destabilized due to the
single base mismatches in the fragment (19). As shown
in Fig. 28, sequence analysis of exon G revealed a C
to T mutation in the two affected siblings, resulting in
conversion of the codon for Arg 831 (CGA) to a premature
termination codon (TGA). Sequence numeration is according to Lubahn et al. (22). Their mother showed the
presence of the normal C and the mutant T at the same
codon (Fig. 28, left). This single base mutation abolished a cleavage site for the restriction enzyme Csp45
I. Restriction digest analysis of amplified exon G of
these subjects and their carrier .mother was used to
confirm the mutation. Incubation of amplified exon G
with Csp45 I yielded fragments of 283 and 183 bp from
control DNA, but only the intact 416-bp product from
the DNA of the affected subjects. The mother's PCR
product yielded both the intact 416-bp fragment (mutant

Oligonucleotide primers used in PCR-DGGE analysis of the AR gene. Exon A was amplified in four subfragments, designated A 1A4: A 1 = nucleotides 1-427; A2 = nucleotides 384-799; A3 = nucleotides 721-1248; A4 = nucleotides 1148-1753 [numeration
according to sequence of Lubahn et al. (2)]. Each of the remaining exons was amplified using a single set of intron-located primers.
Each of the 5' -primers, except that for the A4 fragment, has the 39-bp GC-clamp sequence preceding the AR-specific sequence.

allele) and the normal 283- and 183-bp fragments (not
shown).
In another case of complete AIS, the mutation could
be detected by DGGE only with the use ot heteroduplexes formed by combining mutant and wild-type PCR
products. Amplified exon E DNA from subject 2a (Fig.
3, lane 4) showed the same electrophoretic mobility as
that of the control on a denaturing gradient gel (lane 1).
However, when amplified exon E DNAs from the affected and control subjects were combined, denatured,
allowed to reanneal, and analyzed for heteroduplex
formation, two heteroduplexes were detected (lane 5),
indicating the presence of a single base mutation. Amplified exon E DNA of the mother of subject 2a exhibited
heteroduplex bands both when her PCR product was
hybridized with that of a control subject (lane 3) and
when the native PCR product was analyzed alone (lane
2) due to the presence of both the normal and the

mutant alleles of the AR gene in the mother's DNA.
Using DGGE, seven mutations were localized to exons
of the AR gene encoding the steroid-binding domain of
the receptor in individuals with complete AIS and found
by dideoxy sequencing to be single base changes. The
results are summarized in Table 2. Heteroduplex analyses of the remaining exons of the AR gene in these
subjects detected no mutation in any other exon.

Left, PCR amplification (A) of exon D using 5' GC-clamped primer D1 and 3' -primer D2 produces only long smears on an
ethidium bromide-stained denaturing gradient gel (B). The melting map for this amplification product (C) shows the presence of an
internal low temperature melting domain between 60-200 bases bounded by higher melting temperature regions. Right, Amplification
of exon D using the 5' GC-clamped primer D3 (located 96 nucleotides closer to the intron-exon junction than primer D1) with 3' primer D2 (D) produces sharp bands on DGGE (E). The melting map of the D3-D2 PCR product (F) indicates that the internal low
temperature domain is no longer present and that the coding region now lies entirely within a single low temperature melting
domain.

from GAG (Asp) to GGC (Gly) (subject 7, DG864), were
introduced into the AR cDNA expression vector
pCMVhAR (23). Mutant cDNAs were transiently expressed in COS 7 and CV1 monkey kidney cell lines. In
cells expressing mutant RH774, specific androgen binding was present, but was of extremely low affinity, while
no binding was detectable in cells expressing mutant
DG864 (Figs. 4 and 5, respectively). lmmunoblot analyses of cells transfected in parallel with those used in
the binding assays demonstrated similar expression of
mutant and wild-type AR proteins, indicating that the
defective androgen binding did not result from altered
expression of mutant ARs (Figs. 4 and 5, insets). Transcriptional activity of the mutant ARs was tested in CV1
cells by cotransfection of mutant or wild-type AR
expression vectors with an androgen-responsive reporter plasmid, pC29GtkCAT, containing two glucocorticoid response elements spaced 29 residues apart and
linked to the thymidine kinase (tk) promoter and the
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (24). Mutant RH774 induced a low level of CAT activity, but
only at a supraphysiological androgen concentration of

50 nM methyltrienolone (R1881) (Fig. 4, lower panel),
while mutant DG864 failed to stimulate CAT activity
even at 50 nM R1881 (Fig. 5, lower panel). Similar
results were obtained using testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (not shown). Quantitative measures of
CAT induction by control and mutant ARs are shown
in Table 3.

affinity androgen binding examined by whole cell binding of [3 H]R1881 in cultured genital skin or testicular
fibroblasts of these subjects was undetectable over the
concentration range 0.025-2.5 nM R1881 (not shown).
Despite the lack of detectable high affinity androgen
binding, immunoperoxidase staining, using the antibody
AR32 (to a sequence in the AR N-terminus) (25) demonstrated predominant nuclear localization of AR in
fibroblasts of all subjects, indistinguishable from that of
a control fibroblast strain (26) (Fig. 6). In subjects 2a
and 2b, the A to G mutation at codon 749 in exon E
changed Met (ATG) to Val (GTG). No androgen binding
or immunocytochemical data are available for these
subjects. The nature and location of these mutations
are summarized in Table 2.

DISCUSSION

The incongruity of a female phenotype in the presence
of a male genotype has made complete AIS a disorder
of great fascination for clinicians and biologists. Early
studies (27, 28) demonstrated that affected subjects
are resistant to the actions of androgens on target
tissues. Subsequently, a diversity of abnormalities of
androgen binding in cultured genital skin fibroblasts of
affected individuals was described, implicating defects
of the AR as the basis for this disorder (29-31). Since
the cloning of the AR cDNA (32) and sequencing of the
intron-exon boundaries of the gene (2), the molecular
basis of a number of AR defects has been revealed (214). Analysis of the effects of amino acid changes on
androgen binding and transactivation should eventually
help to clarify the importance of specific amino acids in
the steroid-binding and other domains of the AR. This
study reports the identification and analysis of single
base mutations within the region of the AR gene encoding the androgen-binding domain of the receptor in
seven unrelated families with complete AIS. The application of a modified PCR-DGGE technique to analysis
of the AR gene facilitated detection of AR gene mutations, allowing rapid identification of mutant exons for
sequence analysis.
The effects of an amino acid substitution on receptor
function and sex phenotype probably reflect both the
position and the nature of the amino acid substituted.
Although the three-dimensional structure of the steroidbinding domain remains to be solved, it seems likely
that certain conserved amino acids are located within
or near the steroid-binding sequence, while others remote from the active site are essential for its correct
folding. In this study, single base mutations were detected in exons D, E, F, and G, encoding the major
portion of the androgen-binding domain of the AR.
Androgen binding data are available for six of the seven
mutations. In all cases, specific high affinity androgen
binding, either in cultured genital skin or testicular fibroblasts or in COS 7 cells transfected with the recreated
mutant, was negligible or absent. Five of the seven
mutations described herein (subjects 1, 4, 5a, 5b, 6,
and 7) occurred at moderately to highly conserved sites
within the subfamily that includes the progesterone,
glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and androgen receptors (PR, GR, MR, and AR, respectively). The A to G
mutation detected in exon D of subject 1 converted
Asn to Ser at amino acid 705 and was associated with
the complete absence of high affinity androgen binding
in genital skin fibroblasts. Asn 705 , a conserved residue
in PR, GR, and MR, is situated up-stream of the conserved 23-amino acid region (residues 715-737 in AR)
(22) shown to be crucial for ligand binding by the human
estrogen receptor (ER) and GR (33-35) and suggested
as a possible site of interaction of the 90-kDa heat
shock protein (22). The amino-terminal extent of the
ligand-binding domain of the AR has not been yet
established; however, the complete loss of androgen
binding in this mutant suggests that Asn 705 is either a

as control (lane 1). By mixing control and subject 2a PCR
products, as described in Materials and Methods, heteroduplexes are formed (lane 5, upper bands), indicating the presence of a single base difference between subject and control

component of the AR steroid-binding site or that it
contributes to the three-dimensional structure of the
binding site. There is also evidence from other studies
that amino acids encoded by the 3' -region of exon D
are important for steroid binding. Ris-Stalpers et al. (11)
reported different mutations at Asp 695 in two unrelated
families. Conversion of negatively charged Asp to neutral Asn increased the thermolability of binding, while
conversion to His, which may be neutral or positively
charged, markedly decreased androgen-binding affinity.
Mutations at nonconserved sites may also have profound effects on functional activity depending on the
nature of the amino acid change. For example, the Met
to Val substitution resulting from the A to G mutation
in codon 749 in exon E (subjects 2a and 2b) is a
conservative change with respect to hydrophobicity, at
a nonconserved site, yet resulted in complete androgen
resistance. Met7 49 is conserved across species in the
AR, being present in human, rat, and mouse AR, while
Leu, another hydrophobic amino acid, is present in ER,
GR, PR, and MR. The uniqueness of Met7 49 to AR

suggests that a property peculiar to Met in this position
could be particularly important for the ligand-binding
specificity of AR. Similarly, the C to T mutation identified
in codon 759 in exon E of subject 3, changing Ser to
Phe, also occurs at a site not highly conserved among
the steroid receptors. However, replacement of the
polar Ser with Phe, a hydrophobic aromatic amino acid,
resulted in the complete loss of androgen binding.
To confirm that the mutations identified were capable
of causing the observed androgen resistance, the functional properties of two mutant ARs were examined in
cultured mammalian cells after recreation of the mutations by PCR mutagenesis. Mutant RH77 4, caused by
a G to A transition in exon F (subject 4), had extremely
low binding affinity for [ 3 H]R1881. Correspondingly, it
mediated a low level of androgen-induced transcriptional activation only at supraphysiological concentrations of androgen. It is noteworthy that seven other
unrelated subjects with complete AIS have been reported to have mutations at Arg 774 (4, 1 O, 36, 37). In
five cases, Arg was mutated to Cys (4, 10, 36, 37), and
in two, it was mutated to His (36). Conversion of Arg 774
to Cys was associated with complete absence of androgen binding, lack of transcriptional activity in cotransfection assays, and the phenotype of complete
AIS. In one study, genital skin fibroblasts of an affected
subject with this mutation were reported to have reduced AR mRNA levels (1 O); however, in other studies,
substitutions of Arg 774 with Cys or His were associated
with normal mRNA levels (4, 36). In contrast to the Arg
to Cys substitution, conversion of Arg 774 to His does
not abolish androgen binding; in the study by Prior et
al. (36), the genital skin fibroblasts of one subject with
the Arg-His substitution demonstrated androgen binding of reduced affinity and increased thermolability. The
relatively conservative nature of the Arg to His amino
acid change probably explains the retention of low level
transactivation at supraphysiological androgen concentrations in both the present study and the earlier report
(36).
Single nucleotide substitutions have also been reported repeatedly at the codons for Arg 831 (CGA) (4,
38) and Arg 855 (CGC) (39, 40). The C-T mutation identified in exon G of subjects 5a and 5b replaced Arg 831
with a premature termination codon, predicting a trun-

cation of the receptor protein. Not surprisingly, all mutations introducing premature stop codons into the AR
gene reported so far have been associated with the
phenotype of complete AIS and the total absence of
androgen binding in cultured genital skin fibroblasts (3,
12, 13). In some of these cases, the receptor protein
may be expressed only at very low levels or not at all.
Studies of the testicular feminized (Tfm) mouse demonstrated that introduction of a stop codon into the AR
gene, causing termination of translation in the N-terminal region, resulted in rapid degradation of AR mRNA
and, consequently, a low level of receptor protein (41,
42). In contrast, Marcelli et al. (13) demonstrated a
normal AR mRNA level in genital skin fibroblasts of a
subject with complete AIS whose AR gene contained a
premature termination codon at residue 796 in exon F.

This suggested that truncation of the AR protein, rather
than decreased AR protein levels, was likely to be the
principal alteration in this subject. Thus, the location of
the premature translation termination site may determine its effect on mRNA stability; such codons occurring relatively 3' in the message may be compatible
with protein production. Interestingly, immunocytochemical studies in cultured genital fibroblasts from our
subject with premature termination at codon 831, demonstrated nuclear staining similar to the control, suggesting that a truncated AR (presumably lacking Cterminal amino acids 831-919) was expressed. In vitro
mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that deletion
of the entire steroid-binding domain results in a nuclear
AR with a low level of constitutive transcriptional activity
(23); however, association of the Arg 831 to Stop muta-

Transcriptional activity of the recreated mutant ARs was examined by contransfection of the control or mutant vector,
with the androgen-responsive reporter plasmid pC29GtkCAT,
in the presence of 0, 0.01, 1, and 50 nM R1881. Quantitative
evaluation of CAT activity was performed by cutting the areas

out of the chromatography plates and counting in scintillation
liquid. Fold induction was calculated for control and mutant
ARs at each androgen concentration. Values represent the

Fig. 6. lmmunocytochemical Localization of AR in Cultured
Genital Skin Fibroblasts
Cultured genital skin fibroblasts from control and subjects
with complete AIS were incubated with R1881, fixed, treated
with 2 µg/ml antibody AR32, and stained by the avidin-biotinperoxidase method. Upper panels, Control fibroblasts show
antibody-bound AR concentrated in cell nuclei. This staining is
abolished by incubation of cells with immunoglobulin G preabsorbed with AR peptide (right). Lower panels, Nuclear staining
similar to control is seen in fibroblasts from subject 3, who has
Ser to Phe conversion due to C to T mutation in exon E (left),
and subject 5a, who has a C to T mutation in exon G, resulting
in conversion of Arg 831 to a premature termination codon.

tion with a complete female phenotype suggests that
the truncated AR is devoid of constitutive activity in
vivo. While it is possible that such a truncated AR with
weak constitutive activity could be found in a subject
with AIS, none has been reported thus far.
The Arg to Cys substitution at amino acid 855 (subject 6) resulting from a C to T mutation in exon G
illustrates the importance of the nature of the amino
acid change to receptor function. Conversion of Arg to

Cys at this location was associated with the absence
of high affinity androgen binding in genital skin fibroblasts and the phenotype of complete AIS. In contrast,
conversion of this Arg residue to His in two unrelated
subjects resulted in partial masculinization (39, 40). The
subject reported by Chang et al. (39) had normal androgen-binding capacity, but decreased binding affinity,
and Patterson et al. (40) found reduced affinity and
increased thermolability of androgen binding in genital
skin fibroblasts of two siblings with severe perineoscrotal hypospadias, micropenis, and bilateral cryptorchidism. It appears likely that the relatively conservative
nature of the Arg to His conversion compared with the
Arg to Cys change accounts for the difference in severity of the defect in androgen binding and functional
activity between the mutations reported previously and
that described in this study.
Conversion of Asp to Gly at amino acid 864 (subject
7, DG864), resulting from an A to G mutation in exon
G, is also associated with the complete loss of androgen
binding and transactivation activity. Both Asp 864 and
Arg 855 are conserved in the homologous positions of
GR, PR, and MR, and Arg 855 is also conserved at the
homologous residues in ER, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter (COUP), estrogen-related receptor
(ERR), and other members of the steroid receptor superfamily. These amino acids lie in a hydrophobic subregion of the steroid-binding domain (amino acids 853887 in AR) shown in mouse ER (43) to be critical for
receptor dimerization, a function intimately involved
with DNA binding and essential for transcriptional activity. Thus, failure of receptor dimerization may contribute
to the complete lack of functional activity resulting from
mutations at these sites.
Arginines at positions 774, 831, and 855 are conserved within the AR, GR, and PR subfamily of steroid
receptors (4), suggesting that they are critical to the
structural or functional integrity of the steroid-binding
domain, but probably not to binding specificity. The
recurrent nature of the mutations detected in these
arginine codons (CGC or CGA) may be related to the
presence of CpG doublets, which are potential recognition sites for DNA methylase. Methylation increases
the rate of oxidative deamination of cytosine to thymine
(44, 45), a product that the cell does not recognize the
need to repair. In keeping with this, all mutations detected in these Arg codons have been C to T or G to A
(C to T on the antisense strand) transitions. CpG dinucleotides have previously been reported to be mutational "hot spots" in other genes [e.g. factor VIII (46)].
It is, however, intriguing to note that despite the large
number of CpG doublets in exon A, only one mutation
has been reported to date in this exon (47). The reason
for this is unclear, but a number of possible explanations
exist. One may be that for some sequence-specific
reason, CpG doublets in this region are less subject to
methylation; alternatively, it is possible that mutations
in this region may be occurring with a frequency equal
to those elsewhere, but producing neutral substitutions,
amino acid changes that do not affect protein activity.

AR Gene Mutations in AIS

In support of this, it has already been established that
certain regions of homopolymeric amino acids in the Nterminus are highly polymorphic (2, 3), suggesting that
some variability in protein structure is tolerated within
this region. Extensive investigations of a large number
of normal and AIS-affected subjects are needed to
clarify this point.
These studies demonstrate that denaturing gradient
gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA amplified by PCR
is a valuable tool for rapid screening of the AR gene for
the presence of point mutations, since it minimizes the
necessity for sequencing all exons of the gene in early
stages of characterizing mutations. This study also
highlights the critical importance of specific aspects of
this procedure. Calculation of the melting map for each
exon amplification product allows the design of PCR
primers that generate products suitable for DGGE
analysis. Heteroduplex formation increases the sensitivity of mutation detection. The heteroduplex method
originally described made use of radiolabeled control
DNA as probe (48); however, we found, using simple
solution hybridization of subject and control DNA, that
ethidium bromide staining of the gel permits excellent
visualization of the DNA bands. Direct sequencing of
single stranded DNA after asymmetric PCR without an
additional cloning step increases the simplicity and
speed with which single base mutations can be identified. All mutations identified in this study were transitions (A to G, G to A; C to T, T to C), consistent with
data from other investigators (2, 4, 10, 12, 13) and with
the evidence that transitions (from purine to purine or
pyrimidine to pyrimidine) are the most common type of
mutation (49). Although there is evidence that conservative transversions, such as G to C, cannot be detected
by DGGE when homoduplex DNA is examined (50), it
has been shown that analysis of heteroduplex GCclamped PCR products allows detection of all mutations, including conservative transversions (51 ). Analysis of the AR gene in a larger number of individuals with
AIS will provide further insights into the structural and
functional organization of the AR and eventually enable
mapping of key amino acids in the different domains of
the AR.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects

The nine subjects from seven families evaluated in this study
comprised five unrelated individuals and two pairs of siblings.
All had 46,XY karyotype, complete female external genitalia,
and physical and hormonal features were consistent with the
diagnosis of complete AIS. Ages ranged from 2 months to 22
yr. Postpubertal patients had normal breast development at
puberty, but lacked axillary and pubic hair. Informed written
consent for genital skin biopsy, testicular biopsy, and/or blood
samples was obtained, and the study was approved by the
local institutional review committee.
Calculation of the Melting Map of the PCR-Amplified DNA

To predict the melting behavior of each amplified product,
computer analysis was performed using the MELTMAP com-

1917

puter program (20). For each PCR-amplified exon, the sequence of the whole product, comprising exon and flanking
intron sequences to the end of amplification primers and 5'
GC-clamp, was analyzed.
Preparation of Samples for DGGE

Genomic DNA was extracted from blood leukocytes by standard methods. Approximately 0.5-1.0 µg genomic DNA was
amplified in each 50-µI PCR reaction, using conditions previously described (2). Primers used in the amplification of exons
B to H were initially those reported by Lubahn et al. (2), with
the addition of a 39-bp GC-clamp, as shown in Table 1, to the
5' -end of the human AR-specific 5' -primer sequence. However, after initial experiments, detailed in Results, the locations
of the 5 '-primers for exons C and D were moved 100 and 96
bp closer to the intron-exon junctions of their respective exons.
The AR-specific sequences of all primers used in the remainder
of the study are provided in Table 1. Amplification conditions
for exon A were also modified from those used previously.
The 5'-region of exon A from nucleotides 1-1248 [numeration
according to the sequence of Lubahn et al. (2)] was amplified
in three subfragments (A 1, A2, and A3) using the first three
sets of overlapping primers, as reported previously (2) and
shown in Table 1, with the addition of the 5' GC-clamp, as
described above. In the 3' -region of exon A (fragment A4),
PCR amplification was performed without addition of the GCclamp to the primer, since the high GC content of this region
of the exon acted as a clamp. Reactions were performed in a
thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT), as previously
described (2). A 5-µI aliquot of each PCR reaction was electrophoresed in 1% agarose and examined by ethidium bromide
staining to confirm the presence of the appropriate-sized product. Amplified DNA products were subsequently electrophoresed on a denaturing gradient gel. To form heteroduplexes,
approximately equal amounts of amplified subject and control
DNA (as judged from the agarose gel) were combined in the
presence of 50 mM EDTA, and the mixture was denatured for
10 min at 95 C and allowed to reanneal by slow cooling to
room temperature.
Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis

Electrophoresis of the amplified DNA (5-10 µI) was carried out
using a denaturing gradient gel apparatus (Green Mountain
Lab Supply, Waltham, MA), as previously described (15). Preparation of denaturing gradient gels was performed as reported
previously (50). Briefly, homoduplex or heteroduplex DNA
samples were electrophoresed on a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel
with a linearly increasing gradient of denaturants formamide
and urea at 60 C for 12-17 h. The ranges of denaturant
concentration were determined on the basis of calculations
from the melting maps and were as follows: exons B, G, and
H, 30-60% denaturant gradient (100% denaturant is 40%
formamide/7 M urea); exons C and F, 35-70%; exons D and
E, 45-75%; exon A, fragment A1, 40-80%; exon A, fragments
A2 and A3, 35-70%; and exon A, fragment A4, 30-60%
gradient. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained in ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light. As a positive
control for the ability of the method to detect single base
changes, a known mutant DNA was analyzed with each set
of samples.
Generation of single stranded DNA and nucleotide
sequencing

In cases where altered electrophoretic mobility was demonstrated on DGGE, single stranded DNA was subsequently
prepared for direct sequencing. Initial exon-specific amplification was performed using standard conditions and PCR
primers without addition of the GC-clamp. Single stranded
DNA was generated by asymmetric PCR by modification of

Vol 6 No. 11

methods previously described (52). One microliter of the initial
PCR product was used as template DNA, with a primer ratio
of 100:1 (excess primer/limiting primer). The reaction was
performed under standard conditions, except that 40-45
cycles were used to generate sufficient amounts of single
stranded DNA for sequencing. Amplified DNA products were
separated from oligonucleotide primers using Centricon microconcentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA), as previously described
(52). Approximately 10-20 µI purified concentrated PCR product were dried and resuspended in buffer containing 20 mM
MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl, 40 µM Tris (pH 7.5), and 2 µM sequencing
primer (the same as the limiting primer in the PCR reaction) in
a total volume of 1O µI. After annealing at 65 C for 2 min,
dideoxy sequencing was performed using the Sequenase kit
(U.S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing templates derived from two or more
independent PCR reactions.

Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Two single base mutations detected by DGGE, the G-A transition in exon F converting Arg 774 to His (RH774) and the A-G
transition in exon G changing Asp864 to Gly (DG864), were
recreated by site-directed mutagenesis, using a modification
(23) of the PCR technique previously described (53, 54). The
pCMVhAR expression vector (23) containing the full coding
sequence of human AR was used as starting DNA in mutagenesis. Oligonucleotide primers containing the desired single
base substitution were designed in the sense and antisense
orientations. Two separate PCR reactions were performed,
each using one of the primers containing the mutation and a
second up-stream or down-stream primer as appropriate. The
PCR products were purified, combined, denatured, annealed,
and used as template in the second stage PCR using the two
outside primers. The mutant product was digested with the
appropriate enzymes and cloned back into pCMVhAR for
subsequent use in functional analysis. The enzymes used were
Kpnl (Bethesda Research Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD)
and Csp45 I (Promega, Madison, WI) for mutant RH 774, and
Kpnl and Xbal (Bethesda Research Laboratories) for mutant
DG864. PCR-generated fragments were sequenced to confirm
the presence of the mutation and to exclude PCR misincorporation.

Analysis of Functional Properties of Mutant Receptors
For androgen binding studies and immunoblot analysis, COS
7 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were
plated in 24-well culture plates (100,000 cells/well) or 10-cm
dishes (1.3 x 106 cells/dish), respectively, and grown in Dulbecco's Modified Essential Medium-High glucose (DMEM-H;
Gibco-Bethesda Research Laboratories) supplemented with
5% bovine calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), antibiotics, and
20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2. The next day, cells were transfected
with 1 µg/well or 10 µg/dish wild-type (pCMVhAR) or mutant
AR cDNA expression vectors, using the diethylamino-ethyldextran method (55). For immunoblots, cells were harvested
after a further 48 h, and approximately 150 µg protein (one
quarter of the total lysate from one dish) were electrophoresed
in an 8% acrylamide gel. Whole cell androgen binding assays
and immunoblot analyses using the polyclonal antibody AR 52
were performed, as previously described (55, 56).
For measurement of AR transcriptional activation, monkey
kidney CV1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were
plated in 10-cm dishes at 1 .3 x 106 cells/dish and grown in
DMEM-H supplemented as described above. After 24 h, cells
were transfected with 1 µg wild-type or mutant AR vector
using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure (55). The
cotransfected reporter plasmid pC29GtkCAT (10 µg) contained two glucocorticoid response elements spaced 29 bp
apart and located 5' of the tk promoter and the CAT gene
(24). Cells were incubated in medium containing 0.2% fetal
calf serum with or without 0.01, 1, and 50 nM R1881. Forty-

eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested in PBS and
analyzed for CAT activity, as previously described (23). The
acetylated and nonacetylated forms of [ 14 C]chloramphenicol
were separated by TLC, and the plate was exposed to x-ray
film. To quantitate the activation of CAT, the regions of the
TLC plates containing the acetylated and nonacetylated chloramphenicol were cut out of the plate and counted in scintillation liquid. Calculation of the fold induction of CAT activity was
performed as previously described (7).

Culture and Analysis of Genital Skin or Testicular
Fibroblasts
Fibroblasts established from genital skin or testicular biopsies
were grown in DMEM-H containing 10% bovine calf serum,
2.0 mM L-glutamine, 20 mM HEPES buffer, 100 U/ml penicillin,
and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. For androgen binding studies,
genital skin or testicular fibroblasts were grown to confluence
in 10-cm dishes and changed to serum-free medium (phenol
red-free DMEM-H) on the day before the assay. Cells were
incubated with different concentrations (0.025-2.5 nM) of the
synthetic nonmetabolizable androgen [3 H]R1881 in the presence or absence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled R1881 at
37 C for 2 h. The cells were washed twice in PBS and
harvested in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Total radioactivity
was determined in a scintillation counter, and Scatchard analysis was performed after correction for nonspecific binding. For
immunocytochemical studies, cultured genital fibroblasts from
subjects 1, 3, 5, and 6 and a normal foreskin fibroblast cell
strain (26) were plated into two-chamber slides at a density of
approximately 30,000 cells/chamber. After 48 h, the medium
was changed to serum-free, phenol red-free medium with or
without the addition of a saturating concentration of R1881
(50 nM). Cells were grown for an additional 24 h; washed in
PBS; fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 10% sucrose, and 0.1 M
sodium phosphate; treated with 2 µg/ml of the primary immunoglobulin G fraction of AR 32 (25); and stained as previously
described (57).
