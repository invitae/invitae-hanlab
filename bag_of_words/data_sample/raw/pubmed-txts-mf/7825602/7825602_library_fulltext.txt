Summary
X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) has been associated with mutations in a gene encoding an ATP-binding
transporter, which is located in the peroxisomal membrane. Deficiency of the gene leads to impaired peroxisomal n-oxidation. Systematic analysis of the open reading frame of the ALD gene, using reverse transcriptasePCR, followed by direct sequencing, revealed mutations
in all 28 unrelated kindreds analyzed. No entire gene deletions or drastic promoter mutations were detected. In
only one kindred did the mutation involve multiple exons.
The other mutations were small alterations leading to missense (13 of 28) or nonsense mutations, a single amino acid
deletion, frameshifts, or splice acceptor-site defects. Mutations affecting a single amino acid were concentrated in
the region between the third and fourth putative transmembrane domains and in the ATP-binding domain. Mutations were detected in all investigated ALD kindreds,
suggesting that this gene is the only gene responsible for
X-linked ALD. This overview of mutations is useful in the
determination of structurally and functionally important
regions and provides an efficient screening strategy for
identification of mutations in the ALD gene.
Introduction
X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a peroxisomal
disorder characterized by impaired peroxisomal P-oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), which probably is a consequence of reduced activation of the
VLCFAs. This results in demyelination of the nervous system and adrenocortical insufficiency. The phenotype of
ALD is highly variable, the most frequent phenotypes being childhood cerebral ALD, adrenomyeloneuropathy
(AMN), and adrenocortical insufficiency (Addison disReceived July 20, 1994; accepted for publication October 4, 1994

ease). All male ALD patients and most carriers have an elevated level of VLCFA in plasma and fibroblasts, making
the diagnosis of ALD relatively straightforward (for overview see Moser and Moser 1989).
Recently, a gene responsible for the disease in ALD patients was identified, using positional cloning, on the basis
of its localization in Xq28 close to the color-vision genes.
The ALD gene belongs to the superfamily of ATP-binding
cassette (ABC)-transporter genes and encodes a protein,
ALDP, containing six putative membrane-spanning regions and one ATP-binding domain (Mosser et al. 1993).
ALDP shows 30% identity with PMP70, a peroxisomal
membrane protein also belonging to the ABC-transporter
family (Kamijo et al. 1990). Monoclonal antibodies raised
against part of ALDP showed the protein to be located in
the peroxisomal membrane. This suggests that this protein
plays a role in the active transport of enzymes, cofactors,
and/or substrates involved in the P-oxidation of VLCFA
over the peroxisomal membrane (Contreras et al. 1994;
Mosser et al. 1994). Intragenic deletions were initially
found in -6% of the unrelated ALD patients analyzed
(Mosser et al. 1993). Also, two point mutations, one leading to a missense and the other to a nonsense mutation,
have been described more recently (Cartier et al. 1993;
Uchiyama et al. 1994). Moreover, ALDP could not be detected in lymphoblast and fibroblast lines of several ALD
patients (Contreras et al. 1994; Mosser et al. 1994).
We report the first systematic analysis of ALD mutations, over the whole protein-coding region, in a large
group of patients. We identified ALD mutations in all 28
independent kindreds studied. This overview of the type
and position of the mutations gives more insight into the
structurally and functionally important regions of the protein and facilitates the design of a strategy for the identification of mutations in other ALD kindreds.

Cell Lines, RNA Isolation, Reverse-Transcriptase-PCR, and
Sequencing
Fibroblast lines from 25 male patients and 3 female carriers, who were diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings
and elevated levels of VLCFAs in plasma or fibroblasts
from 28 unrelated ALD kindreds, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium, supplemented with 10%
FCS and 50 ig gentamycin/ml or 50 U penicillin/ml and
50 U streptomycin/ml. On trypsinization, the cells were
washed twice in ice-cold PBS. RNA was isolated using guanidinium isothiocyanate, as described elsewhere (Kemp et
al. 1994b) or RNAzol (Biotecx), according to the protocol
supplied by the manufacturer. Reverse transcription was
performed with random primers, using Maloney murine
leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL). The
cDNA was amplified as five overlapping fragments (see fig.
1 and table 1). When two subsequent PCR reactions were
used, 5 gl of the first reaction was transferred to the second reaction, making an end volume of 100 gl. PCR reactions of fragment 1 were performed in 10 mM Tris-HCI

pH 8.4, 2.25 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl, 0.01% gelatin,
0.1% Triton X-100, 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 0.2
jg BSA/gl (Boehringer-Mannheim), 0.65 mM dNTP, 1 ng
each forward and reverse primer/gl, and 0.05 U AmpliTaq
DNA polymerase/gl (Perkin-Elmer). For fragments 2 and
5, 67 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.8, 6.7 mM MgCl2, 16.6 mM
(NH4)2SO4, 10mM ,-mercaptoethanol, 10% DMSO, 0.2
jg BSA/gl, 0.65 mM dNTP, 1 ng each forward and reverse primer/gl, and 0.05 U AmpliTaq DNA polymerase/
jl were used. PCR was performed for 30 cycles (1 min at
93°C, 1.5 min at 55°C, and 2 min at 72°C for fragment 1;
and 1 min at 94°C, 1.5 min at 59°C, and 2 min at 72°C
for fragments 2 and 5). PCRs of fragments 3 and 4 were
performed as described by Kemp et al. (1994b). To remove
free primers and nucleotides, products of fragments 1, 2,
and 5 were separated on agarose gels, extracted from the
gel, and precipitated. For fragments 3 and 4, the QIAquick-spin PCR purification kit (Qiagen) was used.
Sequencing of fragments 1, 2, and 5 was performed with
the Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems and Perkin-Elmer), using the primers indicated in figure 1 and table 1, according to the protocol
supplied by the manufacturer. The sequence reactions
were run and analyzed, using an automatic sequencer (ABI
373A). Sequencing and analysis of fragments 3 and 4 were
performed as described by Kemp et al. (1994b).

Confirmation of Mutations on Genomic DNA
Chromosomal DNA was isolated from EDTA-anticoagulated blood or fibroblasts as described by Kemp et al.
(1994b) or using the salt-extraction method (Miller et al.
1988). Amplification of 100 ng of genomic DNA was performed in 100 jl, using oligonucleotide primers on both
sides of the mutation (see table 2). Amplification with
primers 303F and 821 R was performed, as described above
for fragment 1 of the cDNA, for primers 1479F and
1861R, and 1781F and 1861R conditions were used as described by Kemp et al. (1994b). The remaining PCRs were
performed as described for fragment 2 and 4 of the cDNA.
Mutations previously detected on cDNA were confirmed
by HpaII digestion (T1045C and C929A), by analysis of
the length of a radioactively labeled PCR product on a
polyacrylamide gel (del 1801-1802) (Kemp et al. 1994b) or
by direct sequencing of the PCR product as described
above for the cDNA.
To increase the specificity for genomic ALD sequences
in Xq28, the amplification was performed in two subsequent steps for some of the PCRs (table 2, note g). For
the first step, 0.1 ng DNA/jl was amplified in 10 cycles.
Subsequently, 5 ,ul product was transferred to the second
reaction, with a final volume of 100 jl. For all sequence
reactions spanning exons 8-10, the annealing temperature
in the cycle sequencing reaction was increased to 60°C,
which is identical to the elongation temperature of the reaction. These conditions were used to exploit sequence
differences between the ALD gene and homologous sequences that are not located on Xq28.

Results
Detection of Mutations Affecting the ALD mRNA
Mutations in the ALD gene were analyzed in one
affected person from each of 28 kindreds, by sequencing
the ALD cDNA derived from male patients or female carriers. Overlapping PCR fragments representing the entire
open reading frame were sequenced directly on both
strands (for primers see fig. 1 and table 1). Only when a

mutation resulting in a truncated protein product was detected and confirmed on genomic DNA (see below) was
sequencing of the entire open reading frame not completed.
Fragments representing ALD mRNA were obtained in
all fibroblast lines. Since the PCRs were not necessarily
performed in the linear range of amplification, and since
this method of detection is able to reflect even very low
amounts of ALD mRNA, the level of transcription of the
ALD gene cannot be judged. Therefore, this method enabled us merely to detect qualitative alterations or complete absence of the mRNA.
In all kindreds, a mutation of the ALD gene was detected. The nucleotide alteration was different for 24 of
28 patients analyzed. No indication of more than one mutation was obtained in each case. An overview of all
different mutations is given in table 2 and figure 2. Mutations are ordered 5' to 3', in five different classes: missense
mutations (13), amino acid deletion (1), nonsense mutations (4), and frameshift mutations caused either by deletion of one or more nucleotides (8) or by splice site mutations (2).
Apart from these mutations, a G/A polymorphism at
position 1934 (no amino acid change) and a C/G polymorphism at position 2632 (downstream of the stop codon)
were observed (Kemp et al. 1994b). In all cDNAs sequenced, the C at position 754 was replaced by a T, altering an alanine to a valine residue.
Analysis of Mutations on Genomic DNA
All mutations were confirmed in PCR products derived
from genomic DNA of the patient or an affected family
member, using the information about the exon-intron organization of the ALD gene (Sarde et al. 1994). Mutations
C929A and T1045C were verified by digestion of a genomic PCR product by HpaII. The mutation C929A destroys
a HpaII recognition site. Complete digestion was monitored by using a PCR product containing an additional
HpaII site (primers 702F and 1145R). The mutation
T1045C created a novel HpaII site, which was confirmed

using a comparable PCR product (primers 914F and

PCR products overlapping the deletion site on a polyacrylamide gel. The remaining mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing of a genomic PCR product, using primer
combinations as indicated in table 2.
For the kindreds carrying the missense mutations
G874A and C2235T, and for one of the kindreds with a

It was established, by analysis of genomic DNA from

mothers (carriers on the basis of elevated levels of VLCFA)
and unaffected sisters, that these alterations were indeed
present in the affected alleles, except for the G874A alteration. No other material was available from the kindred in
which the latter mutation was detected, and thus definitive
proof that this alteration is indeed present in the mutated
chromosome is not available. All other mutations were detected in male patient material.
Mutations located in exon 8, intron 8, and exon 9 were
difficult to detect in PCR products derived from genomic
DNA, as a result of highly homologous sequences with
exactly the same length amplified from unknown regions

represent coding regions distributed over the

outside Xq28 (see also Sarde et al. 1994). With a primer in
intron 7 and in the UTR, DNA from a human control and
from a somatic cell hybrid containing Xq28 as the only
source of human DNA was amplified. Comparison of sequences derived from either PCR product revealed differences between the ALD gene and the homologous sequences outside Xq28, which were used to design primers
with preference for the ALD gene. These primers were applied under stringent conditions to generate PCR products
and sequences that were more Xq28 specific. Although
amplification of other copies was not completely avoided,
it was possible to confirm the mutations previously observed in the cDNA, by comparison of sequences derived
from control and patient DNAs.
The most drastic alteration of the gene structure found
led to a frameshift at amino acid position P534. In the
cDNA, the region between nucleotide 1988 in exon 6 and
nucleotide 2378, the start of exon 10, was absent, while 88
nucleotides of unknown origin were inserted. Analysis of
the mutation at the genomic level revealed a replacement of
a region between nucleotide 1988 in exon 6 and nucleotide
2368 in exon 9, by a segment of -574 nucleotides, which
apparently harbors a cryptic splice donor site 89 nucleotides
downstream of nucleotide 1988. Sequence comparison revealed that this segment is derived from an internal part of
intron 7, which is --2 kb long (Sarde et al. 1994).
Discussion
We have detected a mutation in the coding region of the
ALD gene in all 28 investigated ALD kindreds. No indications of drastic promoter mutations were obtained, as
RNA could be detected in all patients. A single partial (and

complex) deletion was observed, in agreement with the
low (6%) frequency of such mutations reported by Mosser
et al. (1993). No deletion of the entire gene has been reported to date.
The ALD gene product shows all characteristics of an
ABC transporter, with only a single domain containing putative membrane-spanning segments and one ATP-binding
domain. The functional entity of a typical ABC transporter
consists of two sets of these domains. In some transporters, both sets are assembled in a single polypeptide chain
(like P-glycoprotein), while others are formed by dimerization of two polypeptides with a structure analogous to
that of ALDP (like the peptide transporter, which is encoded by two closely linked genes on chromosome 6) (for
review see Higgins 1992). This suggests that ALDP functions as a homodimer or forms a heterodimer with a homologous protein. Mutations affecting this putative partner would most likely also lead to an ALD phenotype. We
can now practically exclude the presence of such a putative gene on the X chromosome, as we found mutations in
the known ALD gene in all kindreds tested. Formally, we
cannot exclude the possibility that mutations in an autosomal gene encoding a presumed partner of ALDP are responsible for the disease in some rare patients. It has been
proposed that PMP70 might be such a partner (Valle and
Girtner 1993).
In 14 (50%) of 28 kindreds, the mutation affected a single amino acid residue. Since no direct functional assay is
available, definitive proof is lacking that these mutations
cause ALD. However, it is unlikely that these alterations
are merely polymorphisms, since in all these cases only one
alteration was found, which was different for 13 of 14 kindreds. None of these alterations were detected in kindreds
with a mutation resulting in a truncated product. Moreover, although ALDP and PMP70 share only 30% amino
acid identity, 10 of 13 different mutations affect amino
acids conserved between both proteins, and 2 mutations
affect residues with very conservative changes between
ALDP and PMP70 (see table 2), suggesting that they indeed affect functionally or structurally important residues
of the protein. In the remaining mutation, S149N, the
ALDP residue is replaced by the corresponding PMP70
residue. By analogy with mutations detected in the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane conductance-regulator gene, another member of the family of ABC transporters involved
in a genetic disease, one might expect to find a high frequency of alterations in the ATP-binding domain, especially in its two ATP-binding-site motifs (for review see
Tsui 1992). However, only three different mutations,
affecting two different amino acid residues, were found in
one of the ATP-binding-site motifs. These three mutations affect amino acid residues that are strongly conserved
among different ABC transporters (Mosser et al. 1993). Although the missense mutation R660W and the deletion of
an isoleucine at position 657 are located 30 and 27 amino
acids downstream of the second ATP-binding site motif,

Ligtenberg et al.: Mutations in the ALD Gene

respectively, they are situated within a strongly conserved
region. Possibly, these latter two mutations affect the
structure of the ATP-binding domain, leading to diminished ATP binding or hydrolysis. Recently, a search for
mutations in exons 6 and 8 that encode the 2 ATP-binding-site motifs in 50 French patients uncovered four missense mutations (including the R617C mutation also
found by us [Fanen et al. 1994]). In our series, the majority
of missense mutations were found far upstream from the
ATP-binding domain. Remarkably, the relative number of
missense mutations is high in exon 1, especially between
the third and fourth putative transmembrane regions,
which can only be partially attributed to the high CpG
richness in this region (see table 2). Apparently, these mutations affect ALDP function, suggesting that this is a functionally or structurally important region that might be involved in substrate selection or transport or in homo- or
heterodimerization.
Mutations leading to a truncated and possibly labile
protein are detected in 50% of the kindreds. These truncations are caused by nonsense mutations, deletions of
one or a couple of nucleotides, a deletion affecting
multiple exons, or splice acceptor-site mutations. In all
these cases, the predicted translation products are truncated upstream or within the ATP-binding domain, suggesting that the mutations result in complete absence of
ALDP function.
The majority of mutations were found only once in the
kindreds investigated. Exceptions are one of the ATPbinding-site motif mutations (E609K), which was detected in 2 kindreds, and a dinucleotide deletion resulting
in a frameshift immediately downstream of E471, which
was observed in 4 of the above kindreds and 1 of 10
different kindreds screened for this mutation on genomic
DNA only (Kemp et al. 1994b). The five kindreds with the
dinucleotide deletion had different haplotypes in the ALD
region, suggesting that this mutation occurred independently in these kindreds. In the two kindreds with the mutation G221 1A, the haplotype of the polymorphic markers
close to the ALD gene was different (results not shown),
making it likely that these mutations also result from two
independent events.
The observed distribution of the mutations may be used
to develop a strategy to detect mutations in other ALD
kindreds. Screening for the mutation is the most reliable
genetic assay to establish the carrier status of females in
ALD kindreds. This is especially important, since in 5%10% of female carriers no elevated level of VLCFA is detected (for review see Moser and Moser 1989). Starting
with the screening of exon 5 for the presence of the recurrent dinucleotide deletion at positions 1801-1802, followed by analysis of the large coding region of exon 1, in
which mutations were found frequently (see table 2 and
fig. 2), a majority of mutations are expected to be discovered (18 of 28 mutations in our series). The dinucleotide
deletion is easily testable on genomic DNA, by using prim-

49

ers flanking the putative hot spot and by scoring for the
size difference (Kemp et al. 1994b). Mutations in the first
exon can easily be detected by analysis of genomic PCR
products, e.g., by SSCP or direct sequencing. When no mutations are found, the remaining exons should be tested
with emphasis on exons 8 and 9. These exons are difficult
to examine at genomic level, because of the presence of
very homologous sequences elsewhere in the genome (also
see Sarde et al. 1994), and should preferentially be investigated on PCR products derived from cDNA. Therefore,
collecting fibroblasts of patients is advisable when the mutation has not been previously defined in the kindred.
Considerable phenotypic variation can be found within
a single X-linked ALD kindred. This indicates that, apart
from the mutation in the ALD gene, other genetic or environmental factors may modulate the phenotype (Maestri
and Beaty 1992). However, a correlation between genotype and phenotype might still exist: a certain type of ALD
mutation might, for instance, be present in kindreds with
AMN patients only. The identification of ALD mutations
will allow further investigation of the relationship between
genotype and phenotype.
In conclusion, the systematic analysis of X-linked ALD
mutations demonstrates that the identified ALD gene is
most likely the only gene responsible for ALD on the X
chromosome, limiting mutation detection to the analysis
of only a single gene. Moreover, the distribution of the
mutations in this gene suggests an efficient screening strategy, which is of special relevance for the identification of
carriers in ALD kindreds.
