Abstract
This paper describes an unusual kindred with familial hypercholesterolemia in which one-third of the relatives with a mutant LDL receptor gene have normal plasma cholesterol concentrations. The proband, a 9-yr-old boy with a plasma cholesterol value > 500 mg/dl, is homozygous for a point mutation
that changes Serl56 to Leu in the LDL receptor. This substitution in the fourth repeat of the ligand binding domain slows
the transport of the protein to the cell surface. The defective
receptor cannot bind LDL, which contains apo B-100, but it
does bind a-migrating VLDL, which contains apo E in addition
to apo B-100. Although the mother is heterozygous for this
mutation, her LDL-cholesterol concentration is consistently in
the 28th percentile for the population. Through direct examination of genomic DNA, we identified the mutant gene in heterozygous form in 17 of the mother's relatives, five of whom
had normal LDL-cholesterol values. The pedigree was consistent with dominant transmission of a single gene that ameliorates or suppresses the hypercholesterolemic effect of the
LDL receptor mutation. Through linkage analysis, we excluded the possibility that this suppressor gene was an allele at
the LDL receptor locus. We also excluded the genes for the
two ligands for the LDL receptor, apo B-100 and apo E. The
existence of this putative suppressor gene may explain the
occasional observation of normal LDL-cholesterol concentrations in heterozygotes for LDL receptor mutations.

Introduction
Mutations in the gene for the LDL receptor produce familial
hypercholesterolemia (FH),' a disease that is transmitted in an
autosomal codominant fashion (1). Individuals who inherit
one mutant LDL receptor gene (FH heterozygotes) generally
have two to threefold elevations in plasma LDL-cholesterol
concentrations and develop symptomatic coronary artery disDr. Leitersdorf's present address is Department of Internal Medicine

ease in the fourth to sixth decades. Individuals with two mutant LDL receptor genes (FH homozygotes) have LDL-cholesterol values that are sixfold or more above normal, and they
frequently have symptomatic atherosclerosis in childhood.
When the concentration of LDL-cholesterol in plasma is
used as a marker, the penetrance of the FH gene is 90% in
FH heterozygotes (1, 2). The reason for the lack of hypercholesterolemia in 10% of genetically affected individuals has not
been determined, in part because genetic markers to confirm
the presence of LDL receptor mutations have been lacking.
This situation has changed with the cloning of the LDL receptor gene.
The LDL receptor gene, located on the short arm of chromosome 19 (3), comprises 18 exons (4). One set of exons
encodes seven cysteine-rich repeats of 40 amino acids that
constitute the ligand binding domain. The adjacent exons encode a region that resembles a sequence in the precursor for
epidermal growth factor (EGF). At least 29 different mutant
LDL receptor genes have been characterized at the DNA level
in FH families (reviewed in reference 1 and unpublished observations). These mutations have varying effects upon the
LDL receptor protein. Some mutations abolish transcription
of the gene. Others encode defective receptors that are transported slowly to the cell surface, fail to bind LDL, or fail to
internalize the lipoprotein.
The LDL receptor binds two protein components of lipoproteins, apo B-100 and apo E (5). A single molecule of apo
B- 100 is found on each LDL particle and its precursors, VLDL
and intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL). IDL is also referred to as ,B-VLDL. Apo E, which binds to the receptor with
higher affinity than apo B- 100, is present in multiple copies on
each f,-VLDL particle. Certain mutations in the ligand binding
domain of the LDL receptor eliminate LDL binding without
affecting j3-VLDL binding (6, 7).
In this paper we report a detailed analysis of a kindred with
FH caused by a point mutation that results in a single amino
acid substitution in the ligand binding domain of the LDL
receptor. This kindred is referred to as the P. family. 6 out of
18 heterozygous individuals had normal concentrations of
LDL-cholesterol despite the presence of one mutant LDL receptor gene. Pedigree analysis is consistent with the transmission of a dominant gene that suppresses the expression of hypercholesterolemia when it is inherited together with the mutant LDL receptor gene.

Methods
Materials. Human LDL (8), rabbit ,B-VLDL (9), human lipoproteindeficient serum (8), and mouse anti-LDL receptor MAb IgG-C7 (10)
were prepared as described in the indicated reference. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).
Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase was obtained from Perkin Elmer
Cetus (Norwalk, CT). [a-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and [35S]_

methionine (- 1,000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from New England
Nuclear (Boston, MA). [y-32P]ATP (7,000 Ci/mmol) for end-labeling
oligonucleotides was purchased from ICN Radiochemicals (Irvine,
CA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a DNA synthesizer and
genomic DNA was purified using a nucleic acid extractor; both machines were obtained from Applied Biosystems (models 380A and
340A, respectively; Foster City, CA). DNA was amplified using the
DNA thermal cycler from Perkin Elmer Cetus.
LDL receptor assays. Diploid fibroblasts obtained from skin biopsy
specimens were grown in monolayer culture at 37°C in a 5% CO2
incubator. About 2.5 X I04 cells from stock cultures were seeded into
60-mm Petri dishes according to a standard protocol and cultured for 5
d (8). Maximal synthesis of LDL receptors was induced by incubation
in human lipoprotein-deficient serum for 24-48 h before study as
described elsewhere (8). Cell surface binding of'251I-LDL, '251-f3-VLDL,
and '25I-IgG-C7 by monolayers at 4°C was determined as described
(6). Metabolism of '25I-LDL by monolayers at 37°C was measured as
described (8). Immunochemical analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled
LDL receptors was performed as described (11).
DNA sequencing of mutant LDL receptor allele. The 3' region of
exon 4 of the LDL receptor gene was amplified by the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) using I ,ug of genomic DNA from a normal
individual and FH 848. Two oligonucleotides homologous to sequences in exon 4 and the exon 4/intron 4 junction were used for the
amplification reaction (see legend to Fig. 3). The samples were denatured at 95°C for 1 min and then annealed and extended at 68°C for 5
min. After 35 cycles of amplification, the DNA was fractionated on a
6% polyacrylamide gel in buffer A (50 mM Tris-borate, 90 mM boric
acid, 2 mM sodium EDTA at pH 8.3). A 220-bp fragment was excised
from the gel, and the DNA was purified. Sequence analysis was performed according to the Maxam and Gilbert method (12).
Oligonucleotide hybridization ofgenomic DNA. Exon 4 ofthe LDL
receptor gene was selectively amplified from 1 Mg of genomic DNA
using oligonucleotides with sequences homologous to the first 25 nucleotides of exon 4 (coding strand) and to 25 nucleotides starting at the
6th base of intron 4 (noncoding strand) (4). After 35 rounds of amplification, one-tenth of the amplified DNA product (5 ul) was denatured
in 400 mM NaOH/25 mM sodium EDTA and dotted onto duplicate
nylon membranes. The membranes were rinsed with 20X SSPE (IX
SSPE contains 0.9 M NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate, and 5 mM
EDTA at pH 7.4) and then baked for 1 h at 80°C. Oligonucleotides
homologous to the normal and mutant sequence were end labeled with
32 as described (13) and then purified by precipitating with 0.5%
cetylpyridinium bromide (14). The oligonucleotides were washed
twice with 80% ethanol and 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5) before
dissolving in 100 ml of 10 mM Tris-chloride at pH 7.5, 1 mM sodium
EDTA, and 0.1% (vol/vol) SDS. A total of 1 X 106 cpm/ml of each
oligonucleotide was hybridized individually to duplicate filters in 5x
SSPE, 0.05% (wt/vol) each of BSA, Ficoll 400, and polyvinyl pyrolidone 360 and, 0.5% (vol/vol) SDS for 16 h at 42°C. The filters were
washed sequentially in 2x SSPE and 0.5% (vol/vol) SDS and I X SSPE
and 0.25% of(vol/vol) SDS for 15 min at 24°C. They were then washed
in 0.2X SSPE and 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 42°C and in 0.1 X SSPE and
0.1% SDS for 25 min at 42°C before being exposed to XAR-5 film for
30 min at 24°C.
Genomic Southern blot analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted
from blood leukocytes, digested twice with a fivefold excess of restriction enzyme per microgram of DNA, sized-fractionated on a 0.8%
agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Biotrans), and hybridized with single-stranded [a-32P]dCTP-labeled probes derived from the
LDL receptor cDNA (5 X 106 cpm/ml) (15) as described (16). The
washed filters (17) were subjected to fluorography at -20°C using
Kodak XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen (Quanta III; Dupont,
Wilmington, DE) for 24-48 h.
Haplotype analysis of LDL receptor gene. DNA samples were hybridized to the appropriate 32P-labeled human LDL receptor probe
after digestion with each of 10 restriction enzymes that were previously
shown to reveal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs)

(18). The 10 restriction enzymes used were as follows: Bsm I, Sph I, Stu
I, Ava II, Spe I, Apa LI (two sites), Ava II, Pst I, and Nco I. LDL
receptor haplotypes on each pedigree member were deduced by analysis of the joint segregation of RFLPs in first-degree relatives, assuming
no recombination within the locus. Each LDL receptor haplotype
encountered in this family has been previously observed (18) except
haplotypes 32 and 37. Haplotype 32 has the following pattern of restriction sites (restriction site absent, -; restriction site present, +):
Bsm I(-), Sph I(+), Stu I(+), Ava II(-), Spe I(+), Apa LI-5'(+), Pvu
II(-), Nco I(-), Pst I(-), and Apa LI-3'(+). Haplotype 37 has the
following pattern of restriction sites: Bsm I(-), Sph I(+), Stu I(+), Ava
II(-), Spe I(-), Apa LI-5'(-), Pvu II(+), Nco I(+), Pst I(-), and Apa
LI-3'(+).
Determination of apo B genotypes. The hypervariable minisatellite
located 181 bp 3' of the poly(A) addition site of the human apo B gene
(19) was selectively amplified by PCR from 1 Mg of genomic DNA
using 32P-end-labeled (13) oligonucleotide HV-1 (5'-TATGGAGGGAAATATT-T-TGCAAAAA-3') and unlabeled oligonucleotide HV-2
(5'-CAAATACAATTCCTGAGATCAATAA-3') as described above.
After 35 cycles of amplification, 5 Ml of the reaction mixture (total
volume of 50 MAl) was subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% denaturing
polyacrylamide gel in buffer A at 200 V for 24 h at room temperature.
Autoradiography was performed at room temperature for 1 h using
XAR-5 film.
Haplotype analysis ofapo E-CI-CII gene complex. Genomic DNA
(1 Mg) was subjected to PCR amplification using 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotides HP- I (5'-AGGAACAGGGATTGCTCACTCGGGG-3')
and unlabeled oligonucleotide HP-2 (5'-TCTTCCTGACTCTGTGGGGTCCTCA-3'). These oligonucleotides flank a previously described
RFLP site, Hpa I, located 5' of the apo Cl gene (20). After 35 cycles of
amplification the entire reaction product was size fractionated on a 6%
nondenaturing gel in buffer A at 200 V for 1.5 h at room temperature.
The gel was subjected to autoradiography and a 186-bp fragment was
excised and purified. A total of 80 ng (80,000 dpm) was subjected to
restriction enzyme digestion with Hpa I in the buffer suggested by the
manufacturer. The digested products were electrophoresed on a 6%
nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in buffer A at 200 V for 2 h at room
temperature. Apo E isoforms were determined by immunoblot analysis of 5 Ml of plasma using monoclonal antibodies specific for apo E2,
E3, and E4 (21). The isoform studies were kindly performed by Professor Dr. Gerd Utermann (Institute for Medical Biology and Genetics,
University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria). Genotypes were constructed for selected members of the pedigree using the results of the
Hpa I RFLP analysis and the apo E isoform data. The apo E-CI-CII
genotypes were determined by analysis ofthe segregation of the parental alleles to their offspring within the pedigree and were arbitrarily
numbered 1-6.
Blood and urine chemistries. Blood was collected for lipoprotein
quantification in EDTA-containing tubes and kept on ice until the
plasma was isolated 4-10 h later. Within 48 h, individual lipoprotein
fractions were isolated from plasma by ultracentrifugation and heparin-manganese precipitation according to the procedures of the Lipid
Research Clinic (22). The content of cholesterol and triglyceride in the
various samples was measured by enzymatic assay kits purchased from
Boehringer Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN) and Sigma Chemical Co. (St.
Louis, MO) respectively. Serum Na+, K+, Cl-, C02, creatinine, uric
acid, fasting glucose, SGOT, SGPT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, total protein, albumin, free thyroxine index, and thyrotropinstimulating hormone were measured on each subject (AM Laboratories, Inc., Dallas, TX) and were normal unless indicated in Table II.
Urine was examined for the presence of protein, glucose, or blood
using Chemstrip SL (Biodynamics/Boehringer-Mannheim Diagnostics) and was normal unless indicated in Table II.

On day 7 of cell growth after incubation of cells for 48 h in lipoprotein-deficient serum, each monolayer from the indicated subject received 2 ml of medium containing 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum
and 10 Ag protein/ml of '25I-LDL (140 cpm/ng protein) in the absence and presence of 500 Ag protein/ml of unlabeled LDL. After incubation for 5 h at 37°C, the total amounts of surface-bound, internalized, and degraded '251-LDL were determined. The data shown
represent high affinity values, which were calculated by subtracting
the values obtained in the presence of excess unlabeled LDL (nonspecific values) from those obtained in the absence of unlabeled LDL
(total values). The nonspecific values composed < 10% of the total
values. Each value represents the mean of triplicate incubations.

Figure 1. Electrophoresis of 35S-labeled LDL receptors from FH homozygote 848 and his mother. On day 6 of cell growth after 24 h incubation in lipoprotein-deficient serum, fibroblast monolayers from
the indicated subject were pulse labeled for 2 h with 110 ,gCi/ml [35S]methionine and then chased with unlabeled methionine for the indicated time. The cell extracts were processed by immunoprecipitation
with IgG-C7, an anti-LDL receptor MAb, followed by SDS gel electrophoresis as described in Methods. The dried gel was subjected to
autoradiography for 18 h at -70°C using XAR-5 film and an intensifying screen. The relative molecular mass of the precursor (Mr
120,000) and mature (Mr 160,000) LDL receptor proteins are indicated. The gels were calibrated with standards of known molecular
weight as previously described (1 1).

a 9-yr-old boy (FH 848) with the classic clinical features of
homozygous FH. He presented at age 4 with a total plasma
cholesterol concentration of 800 and 890 mg/dl on two occasions before initiation of drug therapy. Cutaneous xanthomata
were first noted at age 4. He has not experienced angina pectoris and has a normal resting electrocardiogram. He is currently treated with combined therapy that includes lovastatin,
probucol, niacin, and cholestyramine. His LDL-cholesterol
concentration on therapy is 480 mg/dl, and his HDL-cholesterol is 33 mg/dl. His plasma triglycerides vary between 131
and 224 mg/dl.
Table I compares the metabolism of '25I-LDL at 37°C in
fibroblasts from FH homozygote 848, his mother, with that of
one normal individual studied simultaneously. The FH 848
cells bound 3% of the normal amount of LDL at the surface. After 5 h, the cells internalized and degraded < 1% of the
normal amount of 125I-LDL. These findings are consistent
with the presence of two mutant alleles at the LDL receptor
locus (1). In fibroblasts from the mother of FH 848, the
amount of '251I-LDL binding, internalization, and degradation
were 40, 23, and 62% of normal, respectively. These findings
are consistent with the presence of one normal allele and one
defective allele at the LDL receptor locus (1).
To determine whether the FH 848 cells synthesize defective LDL receptors, the cells were incubated with [35S]methionine for 2 h, after which they were washed and incubated with unlabeled methionine for 0, 1.2, or 2 h. The cells
were harvested and solubilized with detergent, and the LDL
receptors were immunoprecipitated and subjected to SDSPAGE and autoradiography. The normal LDL receptor is synthesized as a precursor with an apparent Mr of 120,000, which
is processed in the Golgi complex to a mature form with an
apparent M, of 160,000 (1 1). This processed form is rapidly
transported to the cell surface. In normal cells at the zero time
point, approximately equal amounts of the precursor and mature forms of the LDL receptor were present (Fig. 1, left). After

the 2-h chase, all of the remaining precursor was processed to
the mature form. Cells from FH 848 synthesized a precursor of
apparently normal molecular weight that was processed to the
mature form at a slow rate. After a 2-h chase, < 20% of the
receptor was in the mature form (Fig. 1, middle). Cells from
the mother of FH 848 appeared to have two types of LDL
receptors. The LDL receptors produced by her normal allele
were processed at a normal rate (Fig. 1, right). The receptors
produced by the mutant allele remained in the precursor form
even after the 2-h chase.
The receptors that reach the cell surface in the FH 848 cells
were capable of binding an MAb that recognizes the first repeat in the ligand binding domain (23) (Fig. 2 A). The total

'25I-f3-VLDL (Fig. 2 C). The binding of 1251-f3-VLDL and 1251IgG-C7 were reduced in parallel in the FH 848 cells, suggesting
that all of the receptors that reached the cell surface bound
13-VLDL. Together, the results of Table I and Figs. 1 and 2
suggest that the mutation in the FH 848 cells slows the folding
of the protein so that its transport to the cell surface is delayed.
The mutant protein that reaches the cell surface is unable to
bind LDL but can bind ,B-VLDL. Similar results have been
observed previously with mutations that affect the cysteinerich repeats in the ligand binding domain (7, 24), or in the
EGF precursor homology region (7).
To search for the mutation in FH 848, we used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify and sequence each of
the exons in the ligand binding domain and the EGF precursor
region. Only one mutation was found (Fig. 3). In exon 4, in the
region encoding the fourth repeat in the ligand binding domain (4), a cytosine at nucleotide position 530 was changed to
a thymidine, changing the codon for amino acid 156 from
serine to leucine (Fig. 3). This amino acid is part of the highly
conserved SerAspGlu sequence that is found in each repeat of

the ligand binding domain (4, 7). FH 848 appeared to have two
copies of this mutant gene. No normal sequence was present at
this position and restriction digests ofgenomic DNA ruled out
the possibility that this region was deleted from one of his
chromosomes (data not shown).
Functional and biosynthetic studies of the LDL receptor in
fibroblasts from the mother of FH 848 confirmed that she was
an FH heterozygote (Table I and Fig. 1). However, the
mother's plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations were repeatedly in the normal range. Her LDL-cholesterol value was
100 mg/dl on two determinations; these values are at the
28th percentile for her age and sex. The father of FH 848, also
an obligate FH heterozygote, died at age 32 of a sudden death,
caused by acute myocardial infarction as documented by autopsy. Over a 7-yr period before his death (1974-1981), the
father had nine total plasma cholesterol determinations, the
average of which was 305 mg/dl.
Fig. 4 shows the pedigree of the mother's family, and the

was denied, it seems likely that the mother and father had a
common ancestor because they both originated from neighboring villages in Puerto Rico.
Among the mother's relatives, 12 were hypercholesterolemic (closed triangles above the 95th percentile in Fig. 5). All

The individuals who inherited haplotype 32, and presumably the mutant LDL receptor gene, are indicated by half-filled

To confirm that the individuals with haplotype 32 possessed the nucleotide substitution in the coding region of the

DNA, spotted the amplified products on nitrocellulose filters,
and hybridized the filters with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide

individuals all inherited one copy of the mutant LDL receptor
gene. Among the individuals demonstrated to have the mutant
LDL receptor gene in Fig. 6, six had normal LDL-cholesterol
levels (designated by asterisks). These included the proband's
mother (II- 14) and his two brothers (III-21 and III-22). It also
included one of the mother's brothers (II-15), sisters (11-4), and
sister's children (III-7).
The simplest explanation for the distribution of LDL-cholesterol values in the P. family postulates the transmission of a
dominant gene that suppresses the LDL-elevating effect of the
LDL receptor mutation. Proceeding on the basis of this hypothesis, we sought to determine whether any of the genes
whose products are known to affect the interaction of LDL
with its receptor cosegregated with this suppressor phenotype.
We therefore sought for genetic linkage between the suppressor
gene and the gene for the LDL receptor itself or the genes for
its two ligands, apo B-100 and apo E.
Haplotype analysis excluded the possibility that the suppression of the LDL receptor defect in FH heterozygotes was
caused by the normal allele at the LDL receptor locus. For
example, the two siblings of the propositus, III-21 and III-22,
both had suppressed LDL-cholesterol values, yet they inherited different normal LDL receptor alleles (haplotype 11 and
haplotype 29, respectively) (Fig. 7). The mother's brother and
sister (II-4 and II-15) who also had suppressed LDL-cholesterol values inherited a third haplotype (haplotype 2). The
haplotype 11 gene, which was associated with low LDL-cholesterols in patient III-2 1, was associated with high LDL cholesterols in patients II-11 and II-6 (Fig. 7). These data exclude
the possibility that a "superactive" normal LDL receptor allele
is responsible for suppressing the effect of the mutant LDL
receptor gene.

Figure 8. Segregation analysis of the apo B gene in the P. family. A
hypervariable region (VNTR) located 181 bp 3' of the poly(A) addition site of the apo B gene was amplified by PCR as described in
Methods and shown schematically in A. Nucleotide position 1 denotes the basepair following the first poly(A) addition site (AATAA).
32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide HV- I (corresponding to nucleotide
position 155-179) and unlabeled oligonucleotide HV-2 were used to
amplify the indicated hypervariable region from 1 1tg of genomic
DNA as shown in A. An aliquot of the amplified product was sizefractionated on a denaturing gel and subjected to autoradiography (B
and C). The symbols and designation for each individual in the pedigrees are the same as those in Fig. 4. In B, the size standards for apo
B alleles included pooled samples from individuals II-6 and 11-7.
Four different bands ranging in size from 700 to 810 bp were arbitrarily numbered as apo B alleles 2-5. The size of the amplified DNA
fragments were determined by comparison with phiX-Hae III-digested DNA. In C, the apo B genotypes of the proband (III-23), his
siblings (III-21 and III-22), mother (II-14), and paternal grandmother
(1-4) are shown. Three additional apo B alleles from the paternal side
of the family (numbered 1, 6, and 7) are denoted, and their size in
basepairs was determined as in B.

To trace the apo B gene in the P. family, we used PCR to
explore a region at the 3' end of the gene that contains a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) (Fig. 8 A) (19). In the
immediate family of the propositus, seven different chromosomes bearing the apo B gene were identified on the basis of
VNTR of different length (Fig. 8). The linkage data excluded
cosegregation of the apo B gene with the LDL-lowering gene.
For example, the mother of the propositus (11-14) has two
alleles at the apo B locus, designated 4 and 5 (Fig. 8 C). One of
her sons (III-2 1) inherited allele 5 and the other (III-22) inherited allele 4. These two boys also inherited different alleles
from the father (alleles 1 and 6, respectively) (Fig. 8 C). Although they did not share an apo B gene, both of them had low
LDL-cholesterol values. Among the mother's siblings, several
comparisons excluded linkage of the apo B gene to the low
LDL-cholesterols. For example, individual II-4 had a low
LDL-cholesterol, yet she did not share any apo B genes with
her sister (11-14) who had a similarly low cholesterol (Fig. 8 B).
Similarly, individuals II-4 and II-1 1 had the same alleles at the
apo B locus, yet one had a high LDL-cholesterol and the other
a low LDL-cholesterol.
The gene for apo E, a known ligand for the LDL receptor,
was polymorphic in the mother's family, but none of the apo
E isoforms (21) cosegregated with the low LDL-cholesterol
(Fig. 7). Thus, the mother (II-14) was heterozygous for isoforms E4 and E3. Her two heterozygous sons with low LDLcholesterol values were each homozygous, one for E3 and the
other E4. Three of the mother's siblings with E4/E3 heterozygosity had high LDL-cholesterols (subjects II- 1, II-6, and II-7)
(Fig. 7). Thus, the low LDL-cholesterol values in the proposi662

Hobbs, Leitersdorf; Leffert, Cryer, Brown, and Goldstein

tus' mother (11-14) cannot be attributable to her E4/E3 heterozygosity.
It is possible that the LDL suppressor effect is due to the
inheritance of a mutation at the apo E locus that is independent of the polymorphisms responsible for the common apo E
isoforms. To exclude this possibility, we constructed haplotypes in the region of chromosome 19 containing the closely
spaced apo E, apo CI, and apo CII loci (20), using an RFLP 5'
of the apo CI gene and the results of the apo E isoform determinations. These data excluded cosegregation of LDL levels
with any gene in this region. For example, the propositus'
mother was heterozygous for genotype 1 and genotype 4 (Fig.
7). One of her heterozygous sons inherited her genotype 1bearing chromosome (III-2 1) and the other inherited her genotype 4-bearing chromosome (III-22), yet both ofthese sons had
low LDL-cholesterol values (Fig. 7).

Discussion
This paper describes a kindred, the P. family, that includes 18
FH heterozygotes who have a bimodal distribution of plasma
LDL-cholesterol concentrations. 12 of these heterozygotes
have LDL-cholesterol concentrations above the 95th percentile, as would be expected for FH. 6 ofthe 18 FH heterozygotes
have plasma LDL-cholesterols within the normal range (Fig.
5). The pedigree is consistent with the transmission of a single
dominant gene that ameliorates or suppresses the cholesterolelevating effect ofthe LDL receptor mutation (Fig. 4). Thus, in
generation II, subjects 11-4, 11-14, and II-15 are postulated to
possess the suppressor gene. II-4 and II-14 passed it on to their
offspring. The other FH heterozygotes in generation II did not
show evidence for the suppressor gene, and none of their offspring in generations III or IV showed suppression of hypercholesterolemia.
Through linkage analysis, we have excluded the three most
obvious candidates for suppressors of hypercholesterolemia
caused by defective LDL receptors, i.e., the normal LDL receptor and its two ligands, apo B-100 and apo E. If a suppressor gene is present, it must produce another protein that influences plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations. To suggest
other candidate genes, it is necessary to consider the mechanism by which the LtDL receptor influences plasma LDL concentrations.
The LDL receptor mediates the removal from blood of
lipoproteins that carry endogenous cholesterol (1). The receptor binds lipoproteins that contain apo B-100 or apo E and
mediates the uptake of these lipoproteins by receptor-mediated endocytosis, primarily in the liver, and their subsequent
destruction in lysosomes. Endogenous cholesterol transport
begins when the liver secretes triglyceride-rich VLDL which
contains both apo E and apo B-100. The apo E on VLDL is
relatively inactive in LDL receptor binding, apparently because it is masked by other proteins, the apo Cs (25, 26). After
the triglycerides of VLDL have been removed by lipoprotein
lipase in capillaries of adipose tissue and muscle, the VLDL
particle shrinks, becomes relatively enriched in cholesterol,
and is designated as IDL or f,-VLDL. During this conversion
the apo Cs leave the particle, the apo E is activated, and IDL
acquires the ability to bind to LDL receptors with extremely
high affinity via apo E. As a result of this binding, most IDL
particles are cleared from blood by binding to hepatic LDL
receptors (27). Some IDL particles escape hepatic uptake and

Downloaded from http://www.jci.org on March 27, 2017. https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI114212

undergo further conversion to LDL. This conversion, which is
facilitated by hepatic lipase (28), is accompanied by the loss of
apo E (29).
A defect in LDL receptors elevates plasma LDL through a
combination of overproduction and inefficient catabolism
(27). Overproduction results from a reduction in the hepatic
clearance of IDL particles, thereby causing an increased conversion to LDL. Inefficient catabolism of LDL is a direct result
of the reduction in LDL receptors. Given this scheme, the
putative gene for LDL suppression must either lower the rate
of VLDL secretion or enhance the rate of clearance of IDL
or LDL.
It is probably significant that the mutant LDL receptor in
the P. family retains its ability to bind (3-VLDL, which is a
form of IDL. This binding is not sufficient in itself to prevent
the increase in plasma LDL concentrations because most of
the FH heterozygotes in this family have elevated LDL values.
Moreover, FH 848, the homozygous propositus, has markedly
elevated LDL values despite the ability of his receptors to bind
IDL. However, this binding does create the possibility that
some individuals may be able to escape hypercholesterolemia.
A reasonable hypothesis is that individuals with the suppressor gene can use the IDL-binding capacity of the mutant
LDL receptor to enhance IDL clearance, whereas the hypercholesterolemic individuals lack this ability. One possibility is
that the individuals with the suppressor gene have a delay in
the conversion of IDL to LDL. This would allow the IDL to
remain in the circulation longer, with its apo E attached. It
would then have a greater opportunity to be removed from the
circulation by the normal and defective LDL receptors before
it is converted to LDL. Such an event might occur if the individuals with the suppressor gene had a relatively low activity of
hepatic lipase. Another possibility is that these subjects have
an abnormal form of apo C that is unable to inhibit the binding activity of apo E on IDL. This abnormality cannot involve
apo CI or apo CII because of the linkage analysis (Fig. 7).
However, we cannot exclude an alteration of apo CIII. To
date, we have been unable to obtain an informative segregation analysis using ten polymorphisms at the apo AI-CIII-AIV
locus (30) in the relevant members of the P. family.
A final possibility relates to the regulation of LDL receptor
production. The suppressor gene might lead to increased expression of LDL receptors in the liver. Such an effect could
result from a direct stimulation of LDL receptor gene transcription, or indirectly as a result of an alteration in the metabolism ofbile acids or cholesterol in a fashion that would lead to
a reduction in hepatic cholesterol concentrations, which in
turn would induce LDL receptors (1).
We cannot exclude the possibility that VLDL production
and/or secretion is reduced by the suppressor gene. The factors
that control the production and secretion of VLDL are poorly
understood and specific products regulating these processes
have not been identified.
An important question is whether the putative LDL suppressor gene lowers LDL-cholesterol values in the absence of
an LDL receptor mutation. The maternal grandmother (1-2)
and one of the mother's siblings (II-9) had LDL-cholesterol
concentrations that were below the 5th percentile. This raises
the possibility that the suppressor gene reduces LDL-cholesterol below normal in individuals with normal LDL receptors.
The number of subjects in this pedigree is not sufficient to
allow this hypothesis to be tested conclusively. It is possible,

however, that the gene observed here as a suppressor of hypercholesterolemia is one of the mutations that produce dominantly inherited hypobetaliproteinemia in individuals with
normal LDL receptors. Certain mutations in the apo B gene
are postulated to have this cholesterol-lowering effect (31), but
because linkage with the apo B gene was excluded, such a
mutation cannot account for the findings in the current pedigree.
