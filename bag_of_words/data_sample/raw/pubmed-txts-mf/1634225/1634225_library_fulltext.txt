Summary. The molecular defect responsible for a case of
mild osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) with repeated femural
fractures was investigated. The proband and his mother,
who presented minor OI signs but no bone fractures,
were shown to produce normal and abnormal type-I procollagen molecules in their dermal fibroblasts. The molecular defect was localized in about half of the proband's pro a l ( I ) m R N A molecules by chemical cleavage
with piperidine of hydroxylamine-reacted m R N A : cDNA
heteroduplexes. The corresponding region was reversetranscribed and amplified by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). Cloning and sequencing of the amplified products revealed in both subjects a G-to-A transition in the
first base of codon 901 of the ~l(I) triple helical domain,
which led to a serine for glycine substitution. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to amplified genomic
D N A from fibroblasts and leukocytes confirmed the heterozygous nature of both patients and proved the absence of mosaicism. The presence of the mutation was
excluded in other healthy family members, who were reported to have bluish sclerae. The mild phenotypic outcome of this newly characterized mutation contradicts
previous findings on glycine substitutions in the C-terminal region of collagen triple helix, most of which caused
lethal OI.

Introduction
The molecular biology of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)
has been elucidated through the characterization of many
(more than 80 to date) different mutations in the type-I
procollagen structural genes ( C O L I A 1 and COL1A2;
for a review see Kuivaniemi et al. 1991). Mutations that

affect quantitatively the production of type-I collagen
are responsible for the mildest form of OI (OI type I according to Sillence et al. 1979). On the other hand, point
mutations, splicing mutations, deletions, and insertions,
which produce qualitatively abnormal collagen molecules,
have been found to be the cause of a wider range of clinical forms. Point mutations that resulted in substitutions
for glycine residues in the triple helical domain were
found in several lethal cases, as well as in severe (OI
type III) and also in a few mild/moderate cases (Byers et
al. 1991; Kuivaniemi et al. 1991). Most of the authors
have suggested a position-dependent effect of glycine
substitutions within chains. So far this has been widely
confirmed for glycine to cysteine substitutions in pro
a l ( I ) chains (Starman et al. 1989).
The most intriguing exceptions to the "phenotypic
gradient" model are represented by the Gly-Ser substitutions mapped in the COL1A1 gene: serine substitutions
at position 565 (Bateman et al. 1991) as well as 598 and
631 (Westerhausen et al. 1990) caused lethal phenotypes.
A Ser-832 substitution was found in a moderate (OI type
IV) case (Marini et al. 1989) while a Ser-844 substitution
caused severe (type Ill) OI (Pack et' al. 1989). More Cterminal substitutions, Ser-913, 1003, and 1009, caused
lethal, lethal, and extremely severe phenotypes, respectively (Cohn et al. 1990a).
Here we present the molecular evidence for a new
Gly- Ser substitution at position 901, which is caused by
a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 3235 of the coding sequence of a pro a l ( I ) gene (COLIA1). This mutation
was found in an 8-year-old boy affected with mild OI
and, most strikingly, in his mother, who showed only
mild features of the disease, but never suffered bone
fractures. Our data indicate that a particular combination of nature and position of the substituting amino acid
can play a crucial role in determining the phenotypic
outcome.

Materials and methods

Clinical summary
Clinical information on the family has been reported in a previous
paper (Tenni et al. 1991). Briefly, the patient, now an 8-year-old
boy, has been diagnosed as OI type IB. Due to repeated femoral
bilateral fractures, he underwent intramedullar rodding at the age
of 3. Since then the number of fractures has greatly reduced and he
can walk without assistance. No hearing impairment has been detected so far. His mother, now 52, never reported bone fractures
and, despite her very short stature (140 cm), she does not show any
particular dysmorphism. Around age 40 she started showing mild
hypoacusia and moderate osteoporosis. She was 44 at the time of
the proband's pregnancy, she had never undergone any medical
treatment, nor did she know she had a heritable connective tissue
disorder. At the age of 48 she bore a second healthy son, who
shows a bluish hue of the sclerae. This trait has been reported also
in other maternal relatives, besides the proband and his mother,
who do not show any other particular feature. A maternal uncle
and his three sons were included in the molecular investigation
with allele-specific oligonucleotides. Skin biopsies from the proband, parents, and controls were obtained after informed consent.

Detection of the mutation on R N A by chemical cleavage
Cultures of skin fibroblasts were established and grown as reported (Tenni et al. 1990) and were used between the 3rd and the 15th
passage. Total RNA was prepared from the patient's fibroblasts by
the guanidinium isothiocyanate method. A normal eDNA probe
corresponding to the C terminal region of proctl(I) chains (amino
acid residues 822-1275; amino acid positions are conventionally
numbered by assigning number l to the first glycine of the triple
helical domain of ct chains) was obtained from a full-length al(I)
cDNA (Tromp et al. 1988) after digestion with NcoI and EcoRI.
The resulting 1365-bp fragment was 3' end-labeled with [a32P]
dCTP and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Boehringer). Approximately 10ng (3 x 105 cpm) of the double-stranded
probe was mixed with 10 gg of total RNA. Denaturation was performed at 80~ for 10min in the buffer described previously
(Lamande et al. 1989). Heteroduplex formation occurred during a
subsequent 2-h incubation at 55~ Hydroxylamine and piperidine
incubations were performed as previously reported (Valli et al.
1991).

Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybrid&ation
Genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples and cultured dermal fibroblasts was prepared according to standard methods. A
500-ng sample was amplified by PCR using 20 pmol each of primers CDC22 (complementary to exon 44) and CDC26 (complementary to intron 45), the generous gift of C.D. Constantinou (Constantinou et al. 1990). Amplification was performed for 30 cycles
consisting of denaturation (1 min at 94~ annealing (30 s at 52~
primer extension (45 s at 72~
with Perkin Elmer-Cetus Taq
polymerase and buffer in the presence of 0.25 mM spermidine.
Approximately 200 ng of the 571-bp product was ethanol precipitated, resuspended in 33% formaldehyde, boiled for 4 min, and
immediately dot blotted on Hybond C (Amersham) duplicate filters.
Allele-specific oligonucleotides carrying either the normal (N):
5'GGTCCTGTCGGCCCTGTTG 3', or the mutant (M): 5'GGTCCTGTCAGCCCTGTTG 3' sequence, were synthesized and
end-labeled by [7-32P] ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Pharmacia). Hybridization was carried out overnight at 52~ individual filters were rinsed briefly at room temperature with 6 x
SSC, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and then at 59~ for
10min. For the quantitation assay, serial twofold dilutions of
amplified genomic DNA (from 100 ng to 12.5 ng) were dot blotted
and hybridized as described above. The labeled N and M allelespecific oligonucleotides had comparable specific activities: 3.2 x
108 cpm/gg and 3.0 â€¢ 108 cpm/lag, respectively. After autoradiography, individual radioactive dots were excised from nitrocellulose
filters and counted. Oligonucleotides and primers were prepared
on a 391 Applied Biosystem DNA synthetizer.

c D NA synthes& and amplification
First strand eDNA was synthesized from 5 gg of total RNA with
reverse transcriptase (BRL) and 100 pmol of the oligonucleotide
primer: 5'CATCATCAGCCCGGTAGTAGCGGC 3', complementary to nucleotides 3638-3661 of the ct 1(I) eDNA sequence.
One-tenth of the reaction mixture was used for polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) amplification through 25 cycles using Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer-Cetus). Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 94~ for 1 min, annealing at 60~ for I min, and primer extension at 72~ for 1 min.
The second PCR primer: 5'GGTGAACCTGGCAAACAAGG 3' (corresponding to nucleotides 2940-2959) was deduced from
the work of Lamande et al. 1989. The amplification mixture contained 40pmol of each primer and 4mM MgCI2. The expected
PCR product of 721 bp was visualized on a 1% agarose gel.

Sequence determination of cloned cDNAs
For sequence determination, PCR products were incubated with
Sau3A, and a 468-bp fragment was recovered from 2% Nusieve
(FMC) agarose and ligated to SmaI-linearized pUC19 plasmid vector. Several independent clones were isolated and sequenced using
the Sequenase version 2.0 kit (US Biochemical Corp.)

were reacted with hydroxylamine for the time indicated and subsequently treated with piperidine. Cleavage products were subjected
to electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel and autoradiography. Sizes (in nt) of the fragments are indicated. The MW
standard was a 32p-labeled 0X174 DNA digested with HaeIII (not

CB6 peptide of ~1(I) chains was suspected. The corresponding m R N A region was therefore subjected to molecular investigation by the chemical cleavage method.
Heteroduplexes were formed between the patient's or
control's m R N A and a wild-type c D N A probe. Subsequent treatment with hydroxylamine and piperidine produced a 240 + 5 bp fragment that was released from the
1365-bp p r o b e (Fig. 1). The same mismatch was found
within the mother's m R N A (data not shown).
The patient's and mother's m R N A s were reversetranscribed and amplified in vitro using a couple of oligonucleotide primers that had been designed to cover the
whole CB6 peptide coding region, from amino acid 802
to amino acid 1042.
On the basis of the chemical cleavage localization, sequence determination was restricted to only a portion of
amplified D N A (468bp, nt 3193-3661) obtained after
Sau3A digestion and cloning of the original P C R product (721bp). Several individual clones were isolated,
and six clones for each subject were sequenced. For the
proband, three of six clones showed a G - t o - A transition
at nucleotide 3235 of the pro ~ l ( I ) gene sequence, which
would lead triplet 901 in the triple helix to code for
serine, instead of glycine. For his mother, two of six
clones showed the same base substitution (Fig. 2). Other
discrepancies with the published sequence (Bernard et
al. 1983) were ascribed to errors in the original report. In
all twelve clones sequenced, triplets 899 and 902 were
C C T instead of CCC; and triplet 903 was G T T (Val), instead of G C T (Ala); as found also by L a m a n d e et al.
(1989) and Constantinou et al. (1990).

To investigate the presence of the Ser-901 mutation
in the family, genomic D N A from leukocytes and fibroblasts of various subjects was amplified in vitro and tested
with 32p-labelled allele-specific oligonucleotides. Only
the proband and his mother were found to carry the Ser901 mutation, while the other family m e m b e r s examined
were negative (Fig. 3).

Inheritance o f the mutation in the proband's family

In the clinical history of the family, the presence of blue
sclerae had been reported, not only in the proband and
in his mother, but also in family m e m b e r s who did not
show any other OI sign.

Quantitation of mutant-to-normal allele ratio in the mother"

We investigated the possibility that somatic mosaicism
might account for the very mild maternal O I phenotype.
For this purpose quantification of allele-specific oligonuc-

483
leotide hybridizations was performed on equal amounts
of amplified genomic DNA from different tissues (as estimated by fluorescence on an ethidium bromide stained
agarose gel). The results reported in Table 1 indicate a
1 : 1 ratio of mutant-to-normal allele in all the tissues examined; therefore, no cellular mosaicism was detected in
two of the mother's tissues.

Discussion

The data presented here provide the molecular evidence
for a new COLIA1 mutation, Ser-901, which causes mild
OI in a young patient and subclinical OI in his mother.
The clinical phenotype was originally classified as OI
type IB (Tenni et al. 1991). The blue sclerae and mild
hypoacusia meet Sillence's (Sillence et al. 1979) criteria
for OI type I, while the presence of dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI) and short stature, although not accompanied by bone deformities, are compatible with OI type
IV. Based on the recent literature (Byers et al. 1991), it
appears that the most common OI phenotype with blue
sclerae and normal stature is classifiable as type I and attributable to quantitative defects in COL1A1, while other
mild/moderate phenotypes, due to structural defects, are
more commonly classified as type IV. We believe that
our patients may better belong to this second group.
As reported for other glycine substitutions, in this
case a G-to-A transition occurring at a CpG dinucleotide
is responsible for the disease. Mutations at CpG dinucleotides are found commonly in a variety of human genetic diseases (Cooper and Youssoufian 1988), and they
have been found in two COL1A1 recurrent substitutions. This notwithstanding, CpG dinucleotides do not
appear as preferential mutation sites in COL1A1 (Pruchno et al. 1991). A more precise indication of the biological relevance of CpG dinucleotide mutations in the collagen genes, will be provided in the future by the delineation of a close-to-saturation map of mutations.
This serine-for-glycine substitution falls within the
CB6 peptide of the ~1(I) chain: the majority of glycine
substitutions so far mapped in this region were incompatible with life. The only three viable exceptions are
represented by the already mentioned Ser-832 substitution (OI type IV), the Ser-844, and Ser-1009 substitutions (OI type III).
In our case, a Ser-901 substitution results in a much
milder form of the disease. The idea that serine, due to
its small and polar side chain and its ability to form
hydrogen bonds, can somehow be accommodated in an
axial position of the triple helix is an appealing one.
Maybe serine is more easily tolerated in some (but not
all) axial positions than other bulkier residues and, in
these circumstances, it exerts a less destructive effect on
collagen fibril performance.
Another important issue about different amino acid
substitutions within collagen is the effect on triple helix
stability. The serine substitution at position 598 altered
the thermal unfolding of abnormal molecules (20~ as
compared to the normal melting temperature, Tm =
40~176
while Ser-631, Ser-832, and Ser-844 sub-

stitutions did not cause any substantial change in the Tm
of abnormal collagen chains. The different thermal stabilities of the mutated collagens led to the conclusion
that thermal unfolding of the protein is not fully cooperative, but is accomplished through the micro-unfolding of a series of independent "cooperative blocks"
(Westerhausen et al. 1990). Previous biochemical studies on this family (Tenni et al. 1991) revealed a Tm of
37~ (4~176 lower than normal) of the defective molecules. Interestingly in the nearest COOH terminal
glycine substitution mapped, Cys-904 (OI type II), the
abnormal molecules had a similar Tm (37~ Constantinou et al. 1989). It is possible, according to the microunfolding model, that the region around the 901 and 904
positions contributes more than others to the general
stability of the helix.
According to the B~ichinger model (B~chinger et al.
1992), Gly-901 an Gly-904 lie in a region of high relative
stability, flanked by regions of lower stability. The model
could therefore explain the low melting temperature of
both mutants, as well as justify the high degree of overmodification due to the difficult renucleation downstream
to the mutation.
Pulse labeling experiments indicated a slower secretion of overmodified procollagen molecules in the proband and his mother, and demonstrated that the secretion of normal chains was also decreased (70%-90% of
controls). The mutant collagen molecules were able to
copolymerize with normal ones and be deposited in the
matrix formed by cultured dermal fibroblasts in the presence of dextran sulfate (M. Valli et al., in preparation).
The ratio of mutant-to-normal primers in the matrix was
about 30%, which is lower than the expected ratio of 75% ;
therefore, normal molecules were preferentially laid down.
The decreased procollagen secretion shown by our patients, as well as by the patient Cys-904, could depend on
the location of the mutation. The integrity of the subdomain in which both mutations fall could play a crucial
role in type-I procollagen secretion. The impairment of
procollagen secretion and the decreased stability of the
triple helix led to a diminished amount of type-I collagen
available in the extracellular matrix for fibril formation.
We can speculate that the disturbance caused by a serine
substitution in the region around amino acid 900 does
not impair, as other substitutions do, the performance of
collagen fibrils that contain abnormal molecules in a percentage lower than that synthesized by the cell.
While we demonstrated that the proband inherited
the mutation from his mother, we considered the possibility of her being a mosaic due to a new mutation that
occurred during early stages in her development, which
might explain her subclinical phenotype. The data on
leukocytes and fibroblasts do not reveal any difference
between mother and son; therefore, no evidence of mosaicism was found. A limitation to this conclusion is that
we could not determine the ratio of mutant-to-normal allele in other maternal tissues, such as osteoblasts. The
clinical heterogeneity between the two relatives, anyhow, is not as striking as in the other documented cases
of intrafamilial variability due to somatic mosaicism,
where very mild and lethal phenotypes coexisted (Wallis

et al. 1990; C o h n et al. 1990b; E d w a r d s et al. 1990; C o n s t a n t i n o u et al. 1990). I n this case, as in m a n y o t h e r O I
