72 "C for 1-3 min depending on the lengthof fragment being synthesized. Other general methods were as described in methods manuals
(27, 28). Single strand DNA sequencing was performed either manually (29,30) or using an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). Numerous oligonucleotides were utilizedin this
study and areshown in Table I.

RESULTS

General Strutegy-Total RNA was prepared from fibroblast
cell lines derived from patients with argininosuccinic aciduria
and first strand cDNA was synthesized with reverse transcriptase using oligo(dT) primers. The entire coding region was
amplified using PCR with oligonucleotide primers (422 and
423 in Table I) just flanking the coding sequence. The PCR
products were first analyzed by gel electrophoresis to determine their size and to assess the possibility of heterogeneity
of the products. Normally, only one major product of approximately 1400 bp was noted but in some cell lines (notably
patient LD) size heterogeneity was obvious at thisstage. The
products of the amplification reactions were cloned and four
to six independent clones from each patient were sequenced
in their entirety. Single base changes which were observed
only once were not considered to be due to mutations but
rather to artifactsintroduced during the amplification process. Previous work in this laboratory (25) as well as thiswork
encountered such changes a t a rate of approximately 1in 800

bases when 30 cycles of amplification were used in the analysis.
Identificution of Single Base Changes-In order to facilitate
the analysis of data, the sequencing reactions were loaded on
the gel as shown in Fig. 1. In this example, two of the four
clones analyzed from patient SS were noted to have a T at
position 578 instead of the C present in the normal sequence.
The sequence of the noncoding strand is shown. (The numbering system used to designate the nucleotides involved in
mutations assigns the A of the initiation codon as +1 and
uses the corrected nucleotide sequence of Matuo et al. (ll).)
This G to A change in the coding strand results inthe
substitution of a glutamine (Q) for arginine (R) at position
193 inthe amino acid sequence (subsequently designated
R193Q). The other two clones which did not contain this
mutation were subsequently shown to have a deletion of exon
13 (see below).
For cell line HL, 13 M13 clones were isolated and six were
sequenced in their entirety. In this case, all six clones contained a C to T change a t position 331 in the cDNA sequence
as shown in Fig. 2. This mutation creates a FokI site in the
nucleotide sequence and substitutes a tryptophan for an arginine at amino acid position 111 (R111W) in the protein.
In patient AR, 12 independent clones were obtained and 6

the two products observed in Fig. 4 probably reflects the
abundance of the RNA products from the two alleles and may
account for our failure to clone any products from the second

HL. In the case of the RlllW mutation in patient HL, an
additional FokI site is created. Amplification of cDNA from

that the sequences encodedby exon7 of the gene weredeleted
in a small percentage of our clones from numerous patients.
On further analysis it was shown that exon 7 is skipped in
normal cell lines and normal tissues at a similar frequency
and we attributed this to be due to the small size of the
preceding intron.' Walker et al. (35) have reported a similar
observation involvingexon 2. However, of the 26 clones
derived from fourunrelated patients that we sequenced, only
three were noted to be deleted for exon2 sequences. All three
of these clones were derived frompatient LD. At the present
time wedo not know whether this represents the second
mutation in this cell line or is the result of infrequent skipping
of the exon.
The two clones from patient S S that did not contain the
R193Q mutation were subsequently shown to be precisely
deleted for sequences encoded by exon 13 as shown in Fig.
7A. To confirm this deletion we amplified a smaller section
of the cDNA (631 bp) using flanking oligonucleotides (198
and 31) and analyzed the DNA on an agarose gel. Three
products were noted (Fig. 7B):one, 631 bp in length, corresponds to the expected size forthe exon 13-containingprod-

of approximately 610bp. In order to determine the exact
nature of the mutation that resulted in the deletion of exon
13 sequences from the cDNA in patient SS we synthesized
oligonucleotides (3089 and 3090) complementary to regions
in the introns that flanked the exon enabling us to amplify
the entireexon includingboth boundaries. The product of the
amplification reaction was cloned into M13 vectors and sequenced. Five of eight clones sequencedhad a 13-bp deletion
within exon 13 asshown in Fig. 7C. This deletion apparently
causes exonskipping frequently, since the 13-bp deletionwas
not observed in the clones that were sequenced. The unexpected product observed in Fig. 7B is likely to be derived from

The previous clinical experience and biochemical analysis
of cell lines derived from patients with argininosuccinic aciduria indicated extensive heterogeneity in the disease and
certainly suggested that multiple mutations might account
