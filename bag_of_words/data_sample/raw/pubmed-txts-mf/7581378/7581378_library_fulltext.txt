Dominant mutations in the fibroblast growth factor
receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene have been recently identified
as causes of four phenotypically distinct craniosynostosis syndromes, including Crouzon, JacksonWeiss, Pfeiffer, and Apert syndromes. These data
suggest that the genetics of the craniosynostosis
syndromes is more complex than would be expected
from their simple autosomal-dominant inheritance
pattern. Identical mutations in the FGFR2 gene have
been reported to cause both Pfeiffer and Crouzon
syndrome phenotypes. We now report the finding of
a mutation in exon Illc of the FGFR2 gene in a
kindred affected with Crouzon syndrome (C1043 to G;
Ala344Gly) that is identical to the mutation previously
associated with Jackson-Weiss syndrome. We also
report finding in a Crouzon kindred a mutation in the
3' end of exon Illu (formerly referred to as exon 5,
exon 7, or exon U) (A878 to C; Gln289Pro) which
encodes the amino terminal portion of the Ig-like III
domain of the FGFR2 protein. This exon is common
to both the FGFR2 and the KGFR spliceoforms of the
FGFR2 gene, unlike all previously reported Crouzon
mutations, which have been found only in the
FGFR2 spliceoform. These findings reveal further
unexpected complexity in the molecular genetics of
these craniosynostosis syndromes. The data implies
that second-site mutations in FGFR2 itself (outside
of exon Illc) or in other genes may determine specific
aspects of the phenotypes of craniosynostosis syndromes.
INTRODUCTION
Mapping of the gene for Crouzon syndrome (CFD, M.I.M.
number 123500) to chromosome 10q25-q26 (1) led to the
identification of mutations in the fibroblast growth factor
receptor gene type 2 (FGFR2) as responsible for the Crouzon

phenotype (2). Subsequent mutational analyses of the FGFR2
gene revealed its involvement with three other craniosynostosis
disorders, including Jackson-Weiss syndrome (3), Pfeiffer
syndrome (4,5), and Apert syndrome (6). All four disorders
have well-defined clinical phenotypes. Crouzon syndrome is
characterized by premature craniosynostosis, shallow orbits,
hypoplastic maxilla and class III malocclusion with no abnormalities of the hands or feet (7). Jackson-Weiss syndrome,
even within a family, displays a more heterogeneous phenotype
than Crouzon syndrome, but always involves craniosynostosis
and broad, medially displaced great toes (3,7). It is differentiated from Pfeiffer syndrome by lack of involvement of the
hands. Pfeiffer syndrome is characterized by craniosynostosis,
broad thumbs and broad great toes that are medially displaced
(7). Individuals with Pfeiffer syndrome may or may not havebrachydactyly and syndactyly of the other phalanges and fusion
of the elbow (4). Apert syndrome is characterized by a more
severe phenotype including craniofacial abnormalities and
pronounced syndactyly of the hands and feet involving both
soft and bony tissues (6,7).
The FGFR2 gene encodes a cell membrane receptor protein
that includes three extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) like
domains, a transmembrane domain, and two intracellular
tyrosine kinase domains (8). The FGFR2 gene is known to
encode at least two spliceoforms, the keratinocyte growth
factor receptor (KGFR) which contains the Iglllb domain, and
the FGFR2 protein which contains the Iglllc domain (8). These
two proteins differ from each other by the exchange of a 49
amino acid sequence located in the second half of the third
Ig-like domain (expression of exon IHb results in KGFR and
expression of exon Illc results in FGFR2) (6,9).
Mutations associated with all four of these syndromes have
been found in the FGFR2 gene. Interestingly, mutations in a
single exon (exon Illc) of this gene have been associated with
three different phenotypes. Only Apert syndrome, which has
a more severe phenotype, has been mapped to a different exon
(exon IIIu). Most surprisingly, two of the FGFR2 gene exon
9 missense mutations which affect the IgUI Cys residue (T1036
to C:Cys342Arg; G1037 to A:Cys 342Tyr) are associated with
both Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes (2,5). In this report, we

describe the identification of a mutation in exon 9 of the
FGFR2 gene in a Crouzon kindred that is identical to the
mutation previously linked with Jackson-Weiss syndrome (3).
We also report the identification of a Crouzon kindred with a
mutation in exon IIIu, the exon previously associated with
Apert syndrome. These results provide further support for
the interplay of multiple factors in determining the clinical
presentation of hereditary diseases associated with FGFR2
mutations.
RESULTS
Detection of identical mutations in Crouzon and JacksonWeiss families
DNA sequence analysis of exons IIIu and IIIc of the FGFR2
gene from individuals within 14 kindreds affected with Crouzon
syndrome has resulted in the identification of seven mutations,
six of which are located in exon IIIc and one in exon
IIIu (Table 1). Three of these mutations define previously
unreported alleles of FGFR2. A fourth was reported previously,
not in a Crouzon patient, but in the kindred that clinically
defines Jackson-Weiss syndrome.
Two affected individuals from family 13, with typical facies
of Crouzon syndrome and no involvement of the hands or
feet, had a C to G transversion mutation at nucleotide 1043
(Ala344Gly) in exon IIIc. (Note that the C1043 to G mutation
was described incorrectly as Arg344Gly in ref. 3). Bidirectional
sequence analysis indicated heterozygosity at this base for
both affected individuals (Fig. 1A.). An unaffected family
member did not have the mutation, based on direct sequence
analysis (Fig. IB). This transversion predicted the loss of an
Acil restriction site in the affected individuals. In normal
individuals DNA sequence analysis predicts two Acil sites in
the exon IIIc amplimer, which would give fragments of 51,
85, and 89 bp on digestion. Enzymatic digestion of DNA
amplified from exon IIIc from the affected individuals in
family 13 demonstrated the loss of the Acil site, producing a
174 bp fragment in place of the 85 and 89 bp fragments (Fig.
1C), consistent with the sequence analysis. The site was
retained in an unaffected family member, again consistent with
the direct sequence analysis. This same transversion was
previously demonstrated in affected members of a JacksonWeiss kindred.

would create a Bsail restriction enzyme site. Digestion of
DNA amplified from exon IIIu from the affected family
members revealed the presence of the expected BsaJl fragments
(Fig. 2C), consistent with the DNA sequencing results. Unaffected family members lacked the BsaJl site. DNA sequence
analysis of the FGFR2 gene from 43 other individuals, from
18 families, 12 of whom were unaffected and 31 of whom
were affected failed to identify this alteration as a polymorphism present in the population at large.

Affected members of Crouzon kindred 12 contained novel
G to C transversion mutations at nucleotide 1024 of exon Me.
This mutation predicts a Gly338Arg substitution in the receptor,
and it predicts the creation of an Aval site. Restriction enzyme
digestion of exon Me amplimers from affected family members
produced Aval fragments of 105 and 120 bp, whereas digestion
of normal individuals revealed an uncut 225 bp amplimer (Fig.
3). DNA sequence analysis of the FGFR2 gene from 28 other
individuals, from 12 families, eight of whom were unaffected
and 20 of whom were affected failed to identify this alteration
as a polymorphism present in the population at large.
Previous studies have demonstrated G to A transition
mutations at nucleotide 1037 (Cys342Tyr) in both Crouzon
and Pfeiffer syndrome patients (4,5) and we observed this
mutation in two of our Crouzon families (families 7 and 10,

Table 1). In addition, we detected a novel G to C transversion
mutation in the same codon in family 5. The latter mutation
predicts the same Cys342Ser substitution that would result
from a previously reported T1036 to A transversion in this
same codon. The C1073 to G mutation (Ser354Cys) identified
in family 19 (Table 1) was also identified in a previous study (2).
DISCUSSION
The finding of a Crouzon kindred with the C1043 to G
(Ala344Gly) mutation which was previously reported to cause
Jackson-Weiss syndrome (3) argues against a simple single
mutation explanation for the specific phenotypes characteristic
of each of these syndromes. This observation, coupled with
previous reports demonstrating a G1037 to A mutation in the
FGFR2 gene in both Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndrome families,
strengthens the case for the interaction of other gene products
(or environmental factors) in determining the phenotypes of
these craniosynostosis syndromes. It is also quite possible that
unidentified polymorphisms within the FGFR2 gene itself are
responsible for the phenotypic differences, since this gene
contains over a dozen exons, of which only two (exons IIIu
and Me) have been extensively characterized in patients with
the inherited craniosynostosis syndromes. The involvement of
additional genetic factors in the determination of the phenotypes could account for the variable expressivity displayed
within a kindred such as that observed in family 1(1) and in
Jackson-Weiss families (11). There are four known FGFR
genes and at least nine cognate ligand genes, as well as
accessory proteins which are thought to be involved in ligand
binding. Polymorphisms within any one of these genes could
affect the expression of the phenotype (10).
The diagnosis of Crouzon syndrome rather than JacksonWeiss syndrome in family 13 was based on the clinical
presentation of the proband and an affected paternal aunt, both
of whom had normal hands and feet and lacked the medial
displacement of great toes that would indicate Jackson-Weiss
syndrome. The affected father was not available for study.

Clinical difficulty in distinguishing Crouzon and JacksonWeiss syndromes could provide another explanation for the
occurrence of identical mutations in kindreds of both types.
In view of the variable expressivity of diagnostic foot abnormalities in the Jackson-Weiss kindred that contains the C1043 to
G (Ala344Gly) mutation (3,11), the two affected individuals
in family 13 might lack foot abnormalities due to statistical
sampling error. Studies of genotype-phenotype correlations in
additional kindreds will be required to redefine these craniofacial syndromes in precise molecular terms.
Mutations in exon IIIu of the FGFR2 gene were previously
documented only in Apert syndrome patients (6). Since
mutations in exon IIIu of the FGFR2 gene would affect both
the KGFR and FGFR2 spliceoforms of the gene, it was
proposed that this might account for the more severe phenotype
associated with Apert syndrome (6). The finding of Crouzon
patients with mutations in exon IIIu demonstrates that not all
mutations that affect both spliceoforms of the FGFR2 gene
result in the severe Apert phenotype. It is likely that the
location of the mutations within exon IIIu are important in
differentiating the Apert and Crouzon phenotypes, as the
Crouzon and Apert exon IIIu mutations affect different structural domains of both of the FGFR2 gene products (KGFR
and FGFR2) even though they are encoded by the same exon.
The Crouzon mutation is located in a sequence that encodes
the amino terminal half of the third Ig-like domain, while the
Apert mutations are in sequence that encodes the spacer region
between the second and third Ig-like domains.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
To establish the diagnosis of CFD, individual family members from each of
the families were examined and determined to fit the diagnostic criteria for
Crouzon syndrome including: craniosynostosis of one or more cranial sutures;
shallow orbits with exorbitism; maxillary hypoplasia with relative mandibular
prognathism; and normal hands and feet. In the case of family 13, the patients'
physician has examined the affected individuals and has stated they have
normal hands and feet. No cases of ambiguous diagnosis were encountered.
Informed consent was obtained from each family member, or the parent of
minors, for venipuncture and molecular studies.
DNA purification and amplification
DNA was extracted from whole peripheral blood specimens using the Puregene
DNA purification kit (Gentra Systems Inc; Minneapolis, MN) in accordance
with the manufacturers recommendations. Multiple 100 nl amplification
reactions were performed for each patient, as described (I), to generate
sufficient DNA for sequencing. The primers, 195 ATCATTCCTGTGTCGTCTAAC and 193 AAAAAACCCAGAGAGAAAGAACAGTATA, used to
amplify exon Me were derived from flanking intronic sequence. The 5' primer
for exon IIIu, E75, GCCGGCAAATGCCTCCACAG, was designed from
exonic sequences, and the 3' exon IIIu primer, 173 TGTGGCCAAACCCATGAAGA was designed from intronic sequences. Cycling was done on a Perkin
Elmer 9600 thermal cycler using the following program, 1 cycle at: 95°CX3
min; 40 cycles at: 94°CX15 s, 55°CX15 s, 72°CX30 s; 1 cycle at: 72°C 10
min; 1 cycle at: 4°C forever.
Sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion
The amplified DNA was concentrated and all primers removed using Microcon100 microconcentrators (Amicon; Beverly, MA). The recovered DNA was
examined on an 8% Longranger™Gel (AT BioChem; Malvern, PA) for sample
purity and to obtain an indication of the DNA concentration for cycle
sequencing reactions. Samples were sequenced using the Applied Biosystems
Taq DyeDeoxy™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit with the ABI 373A
sequencer (Perkin Elmer; Norwalk CT). The sequence data was analyzed
using Sequencher™ software (GeneCodes; Ann Arbor, MI). Overnight restriction digests were done on all amplimers that were identified by sequence
analysis as having gained or lost a restriction enzyme site.
