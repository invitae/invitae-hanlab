For screening the AI94 genotype, genomic DNA (1 pg) was first
submitted to 30 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of147 bp spanning exon 3 of the PAH gene (5' primer: 5'
ATTGAATCTAGACCTTCTCG 3'; 3' primer: 5' CTTATCTCGTGAAAGCTCAT 3'). Then, 5 pl of the final volume were deposited
on a Biotrace RP charge-modified nylon membrane (Gelman Sciences) and hybridized using either normal or mutant 21-bp allelespecific oligonucleotide (ASO) probes phosphorylated at their 5'-OH
termini (11). The sequences were 5' ACAAACATCATCAAGATCTTG 3' and 5' TGACAAACATCAAGATCTTGA 3' for the

In an attempt to characterize the mutant genotype in our
patient, total RNA was extracted from the needle biopsy of
the liver, after enzyme assays. Starting from approximately
20 mg of tissue, 80 pg of total RNA were obtained. Fig. 2A
shows that the PAH mRNA of patient IV.2 was normal in
size and amount. A cDNA library was constructed, and two
full-length clones were obtained and sequenced. A 3-bp inframe deletion of an isoleucine codon wasdetected in exon 3
(AI94). However, since codons 94 and 95 are structurally
identical, it is impossible to decide whether the deleted codon
is codon Ile-94 or codon Ile-95 (Fig. 2 B ) . The rest of the
sequence was identical to thatof normal cDNA (13).
