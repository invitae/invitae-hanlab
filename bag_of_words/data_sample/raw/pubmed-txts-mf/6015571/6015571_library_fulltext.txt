low standard physiochemical principles '(13), it is not necessary to postulate special channels to interpret these
results (14).
3) The concept of "specific blocking action of the sodium-carrier system" arose partly from the observed
difference between the effect of TTX
on action potentials produced in
Ringer's (sodium-rich) solution and that
in potassium-rich media (4). Although
in the squid giant axon the effectiveness of TTX blockage differs according to the composition of the external
media, the difference -is only quantitative. Our experiments indicate that, at
certain concentrations of TTX in the
external medium, the action of TTX
could be called "calcium-specific" (Fig.
2). However, this would obviously be
inappropriate, since an increase in the
concentration of TTX can also block
the action potential in media contain-

ing sodium.
Our findings concerning the effects
of TTX on squid giant axons do not
support the separate channel hypothesis for excitable membranes.
There is considerable evidence indicating that exchange of cations at sites
of the membrane macromolecules is the
primary physicochemical event leading to the process of excitation (14).
Strong binding of TTX to the charged
sites on the external layer of membrane
macromolecules would hinder the rapid
exchange of small univalent and
divalent cations, and would account for
the observed effects of TTX. This explanation is consistent with the fact
that TTX when applied intracellularly
has no effect on the action potential

(15).

Negro Variant of
Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase
Deficiency (A-) in Man
Abstract. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in erythrocytes of the Negro
type associated with enzyme deficiency
(A-) was separated by chromatography
on a carboxymethyl-Sephadex column
from the electrophoretically indistinguishable Negro variant with normal
enzyme activity (A+). Quantitative immunologic neutralization tests indicated
that the A - enzyme had about the same
enzymatic and serological activity as the
A + and the normal (B+) enzymes.

The enzyme activity of the A- variant
in young erythrocytes was similar to
that in young cells from normal individuals, although the activity of the
A- variant in unfractionated red cells
was J0 to 15 percent of normal. These
data indicate that the basic defect in
the variant enzyme (A -) is a structural mutation which causes more
rapid degradation of the enzyme during
erythrocyte aging.
Tihe erythrocytes of about 20 percent
of Negro males have an electrophoretically rapid variant of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase with normal enzyme activity (A+). The cells of another 10 to 15 percent have a glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase which is electrophoretically indistinguishable from
A+ but has reduced (10 to 15 percent
of normal) activity (A-) (1). The levels
of enzyme in nucleated tissues such as
leukocytes and liver of A- Negro
males are normal or only slightly decreased (2). No consistent differences
have been found between A+ and Aenzymes in enzymatic properties and

immunological properties (3). Kirkman
et al. suggested that enzyme deficiency
in erythrocytes may be caused by a
quantitative reduction in the number of
the enzyme molecules (4). Luzzato and
Allan observed differences in heat stability and elution patterns on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-Sephadex column
chromatography between the A+ and
A- enzymes (5).
To find out whether the low activity
in the red cells deficient in glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Negro
males resulted from a structural abnormality producing a less-active enzyme
molecule, from decreased rate of production, from an increased degradation
rate, or from a combination of these
effects, the following experiments were
carried out.
The A + and A - enzymes can be
separated by DEAE-Sephadex column
chromatography (5). The low recovery
of the activity of A- enzyme from the
column could also be confirmed. Since
the A- enzyme was inactivated in the
absence of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), the low recovery of A- enzyme from the DEAESephadex column may have been partly
due to loss of NADP by the anion exchanger during chromatography. Another chromatographic system-car-

boxymethyl cellulose-Sephadex column
-gave a more effective separation of
the A+ and A- enzymes (Fig. 1). The
recovery of enzyme activity was better
than 90 percent for each enzyme. These
findings indicate structural differences
between the A+ and A- enzymes.

Fig. 1. Elution pattern of A+ and A- enzymes from a carboxymethyl-Sephadex column.
A mixture of A+ enzyme (1.65 units) and A- enzyme (1.9 units) was placed on a
carboxymethyl-Sephadex column (1 by 30 cm) buffered with 0.01M acetate buffer, pH
5.7, and eluted with linear gradient of NaCl concentration from 0.1 to 0.4M. Enzyme
activity is expressed as the number of micromoles of NADP reduced per minute
at 25°C.

with crystalline B + enzyme, which is
homogeneous by various physicochemical criteria.
The purified A+ and B+ enzyme and
partially purified A+, B+, and Ashowed no difference in neutralization
behavior (Fig. 2). From the slope (Fig.
2) it was estimated that 1 ml of undiluted antiserum neutralized 8 to 9
units of each one of the different
enzymes. Since the purified homogeneous preparations of B+ and A+ enzymes had a specific activity of 180
units per milligram of enzyme protein,
1 ml of antiserum absorbed about 50
jug of B + and A+ enzyme protein (8).
The B + enzyme is the homologous antigen for the antiserum used for this
experiment; the antiserum, therefore,
should have maximum capacity to absorb B + enzyme protein. Thus, the
amount of A- enzyme protein absorbed
by 1 ml of the antiserum should not
exceed 50 ug. This fact, together with
the finding that 1 ml of the antiserum
neutralized 8 to 9 units of A- enzyme,
indicated that the specific activity of
A- enzyme should be at least 180 units
per milligram of enzyme proteins; that
is, the A- enzyme in each molecule
must be as active as the normal (B +)
and A+ enzymes.
If the serological activity of A- enzyme were much lower than that of
the normal (B+) or A+ enzyme (that
is, lesser amounts of A- enzyme protein were absorbed by the antiserum),
the specific activity of A- enzyme
would have to be much higher than that
of B+ or A+ enzyme, according to the
equation shown in reference (8). This
98

seemed highly unlikely. One may conclude that A- enzyme has about the
same serological activity and is enzymatically as active as the normal (B+)
and A+ enzymes. Consequently, the
low enzyme activity of deficient Asubjects results from re'duction in the
number of enzymatically active Aenzyme molecules in red cells.
No quantitative differences were
found in the neutralization of the purified homogeneous enzyme preparations
and the partially purified preparations
which were prepared simply by eliminating hemoglobin from hemolyzates.
This finding indicates that the partially
purified preparation did not contain any
other cross-reacting materials and that
only the enzymatically active protein
was serologically active (9).

Erythrocytes were separated into
"age" groups, according to their specific gravity, by the two-phase centrifugation developed by Danon et al. (10).
Samples of fresh blood and phthalate
ester mixtures of various densities were
centrifuged (1.2 by 5 cm tubes) at 25,000 rev/min for 30 minutes at 25°C
(Spinco model-L, L-50 rotor). Density
of the phthalate ester mixture was selected so that in one tube about 5 percent of the cells representing the younger cells could be collected from
above the fluid, while in the other,
about 5 percent of the cells representing the older cells were collected from
below the separating fluid. Fractionation
and radioactivity measurement of erythrocytes obtained after labeling with
Fe59 in vivo indicated good separation
of the cells into different age groups
(2670 count/min per milligram of
hemoglobin in the top layer, 642 in the
unfractionated cells, and 88 in the
bottom layer, 7 days after labeling).
The normal younger cells (B+) contained two to three times more (Table
1) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(as well as 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) than the total cell population did, as has been reported by Marks
et al. (11) and Brok et al. (12). In the
red cells of Negro males (A-), deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the younger cells contained
more than ten times as much enzyme
as the total cell population. Thus, the
enzyme activity in the younger Acells was close to that of the normal
(B+) younger cells, even though the
enzyme activity in unfractionated Ared cells was only 10 to 15 percent
in comparison with normals.
The mechanism of loss of enzyme
activity with red cells aging is not clear.
In vitro, the normal enzyme (B+) was
reversibly inactivated by dissociation
into subunits by removal of bound
NADP (6). The A- enzyme was more
easily (so far irreversibly) inactivated;
that is, about 80 percent of enzyme
activity was lost by dialysis for 3 days
in the absence of NADP at 4°C. No
serological cross reactions could be
demonstrated in this inactivated en-zyme by the quantitative neutralization
test.
In summary, although the enzyme

of the Negro-type deficiency (A-) is
structurally different from Negro variant with normal activity (A+), the
specific enzyme activity and the immunologic activity of the A- enzyme
molecule are very similar to those of

Local Recognition of Histocompatibility Differences
in Skin Grafts
Abstract. Studies in rabbits of skin grafts tagged with tritiated thymidine indicate a greater proliferation of endothelial cells and fibroblasts at the site of
an allograft than at that of an autograft as early as the first day after grafting.
It appears, therefore, that allogeneic differences can be recognized and responded
to locally almost at once. Labeled nuclear material is found to be transferred
from the epithelial cells of skin grafts to host cells of the adjacent tissues. A
mechanism therefore exists which might effect a local transfer of information on

histocompatibility differences.
It is generally accepted that first-set
skin allografts are not distinguishable
from autografts by morphological criteria for a number of days after grafting, the time depending on the degree
of histocompatibility difference. Not
until the immune response has progressed far enough to provide an observable difference in the degree of
cellular infiltration and vascular development can the allograft be identified.
In hundreds of skin cross-grafting experiments, using two outbred strains of
rabbits, we have found this time to be
hardly ever shorter than 4 days fromf
the time of grafting, rejection occurring between 7 and 10 days. However,
when graft sites were examined by
microangiography, the impression was
gained that the vascular reaction under and about a skin allograft is greater than that at an equivalent autograft
in the same animal as early as 1 to 2
days after grafting.
6 JANUARY 1967

In the present experiments an effort
was made to substantiate this difference
objectively by determining the uptake
of labeled thymidine by the nuclei of
endothelial cells and fibroblasts in the
graft and graft bed. The demonstration of an almost immediate difference
in the response to allograft and autograft would suggest that recognition of
4"nonself" may be very prompt and
may take place locally. Such an early
differential response has been reported
in the goldfish with respect to scale
transplants (1), and in the rabbit for
hair follicles in transplanted skin (2).
Circular full thickness grafts of ear
skin (1.7 cm in diameter) were exchanged between pairs of young rabbits (1 kg in weight) of two strains
with presumed strong histocompatibility
differences (New Zealand Whites and
Chinchillas). Each rabbit received a
similar autograft on its other ear at the
same time. All surgical procedures

were carried out aseptically. Grafts
were left undressed. At 6 and 12 hours
after grafting, and at daily intervals,
rabbits were killed 2 hours after they
had received an intravenous dose of
tritiated thymidine (H3Th) (0.75 p,c/kg
of body weight, specific activity 3

c/mmole). Autoradiographs, exposed
for 2 weeks, were prepared of tissue
sections which included graft and graft
bed. Cells with tritium-labeled nuclei,
excluding cells of obvious epithelial
origin, were counted from the epithelium to the cartilage, between grid lines
(64 lines per inch) extending perpendicularly to the skin surface along the
full length of the graft. Three to eight
widely spaced tissue sections were
counted in this way for each graft.
The mean number of labeled cells per
grid space was calculated for each section, and from those, the overall mean
and variation for each graft. The allograft/ autograft ratio of labeled cells
was then determined for each animal.
As seen in Table 1, labeled nuclei
were more numerous in the allograft
than in the autograft in every animal.
Apparently, then, the nonepithelial cells
were proliferating at a greater rate in
the allografts. Differences did not become statistically significant until 24
hours, but were in the same direction
even at 6 and 12 hours. Results are
presented for the first 4 days; thereafter
standard morphological differences
evoked by the immune response became obvious.
Although the time course of the reaction to the allograft might by itself
suggest a secondary immune response,
it is very unlikely that the recipient in
each of the randomly selected animal
pairs was presensitized to the donor
tissue. Our findings are much more
reasonably interpreted as indicating a
local transfer of histocompatibility information from the outset of the healing of a tissue transplant. It is of interest that the reaction elicited is a
mitogenic one.
"Antigenic recognition" in vitro was
inferred by Moller (3) from the cytocidal effect of nonsensitized lymphocytes on allogeneic and semi-syngeneic
target cells in the presence of phytohemagglutinin. However, in the absence
of phytohemagglutinin, nonsensitized
lymphocytes have a stimulatory effect
on allogeneic target cells in vitro (4).
We have observed in vivo a mitogenic
effect upon the epithelium of skin allografts prior to graft destruction (5).

The enzyme deficiency in A- red cells
