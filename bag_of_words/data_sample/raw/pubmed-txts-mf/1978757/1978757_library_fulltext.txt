different US markers. It is most likely that the different markers in the two U5
sequences were generated from mismatch repair of one of the LTR's. However, it
is not clear which pathway generated this recombinant provirus.
27. Fisher's exact test was calculated with 21 recombinants. The recombinant with two
different markers in the US was not induded because it is not dear which type of
minus strand transfer was used. Calculation including this sample was also
performed, and the result indicated the distribution still is not random.

Germ Line p53 Mutations in a Familial
Syndrome of Breast Cancer, Sarcomas,
and Other Neoplasms

Familial cancer syndromes have helped to define the role
of tumor suppressor genes in the development of cancer.
The dominantly inherited Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS)
is of particular interest because of the diversity of childhood and adult tumors that occur in affected individuals.
The rarity and high mortality of LFS precluded formal
linkage analysis. The alternative approach was to select
the most plausible candidate gene. The tumor suppressor
gene, p53, was studied because of previous indications
that this gene is inactivated in the sporadic (nonfamilial)
forms of most cancers that are associated with LFS. Germ
line p53 mutations have been detected in all five LFS
families analyzed. These mutations do not produce
amounts of mutant p53 protein expected to exert a
trans-dominant loss of function effect on wild-type p53
protein. The frequency of germ line p53 mutations can
now be examined in additional families with LFS, and in
other cancer patients and families with clinical features
that might be attributed to the mutation.
IN 1969, LI AND FRAUMENI REVIEWED MEDICAL RECORDS

and death certificates of 648 childhood rhabdomyosarcoma
patients and identified four families in which siblings or cousins
had a childhood sarcoma (1). These four families also had striking
histories of breast cancer and other neoplasms, suggesting a new
familial cancer syndrome of diverse tumors (Li-Fraumeni syndrome;
LFS). Recently completed prospective studies have confirmed the
30 NOVEMBER 1990

high risk in family members of the tumor types that comprise LFS
(2). Since the original description of the syndrome, systematic
studies and anecdotal reports have confirmed its existence in various
geographic and ethnic groups (3). The spectrum of cancers in the
syndrome (Table 1) has been determined to include breast carcinomas, soft tissue sarcomas, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, leukemia,
and adrenocortical carcinoma. Possible component tumors of LFS
are melanoma, gonadal germ cell tumors, and carcinomas of the
lung, pancreas, and prostate (4, 5). These diverse tumor types in
family members characteristically develop at unusually early ages,
and multiple primary tumors are frequent.
To test the hypothesis that the Li-Fraumeni syndrome has a
genetic etiology, Williams and Strong (5) applied segregation
analysis and demonstrated that the observed cancer distribution in
families best fit a rare autosomal dominant gene model. This model
also predicted that the probability, for the families at risk, of
developing any invasive cancer (excluding carcinomas of the skin)

sequences. However, since the reversion rate in retroviral replication of such a 4-bp
insertion is lower than 1l-7 per insertion (5), this explanation is unlikely. Different
markers in the two U5 regions may also result from mismatch repair of either the
5' US or the 3' U5 region. If the 5' U5 region experienced the repair and resulted
in a different marker than the 3' US region, then the minus strand transfer had to
be intermolecular (from WH204 RNA to WH13 RNA) to form the 3' LTR.
Suppose the minus strand strong stop DNA synthesis of WH13 RNA never
initiated. As a result uS and pbs were intact. Then it was possible for the minus
strand DNA synthesis to continue and copy the US marker of WH13 (Bam HI).
After completion of DNA synthesis and repair, the Bam HI marker remained in the
5' U5 and resulted in different markers in the two US regions. It is also possible
that the 3' US region was repaired to a different marker. Then the minus strand
strong stop transfer had to be intramolecular (from WH13 to WH13) to result in
the 5' WH13-likc LTR. Suppose a strand displacement event occurred at the end
of the 3' LTR and formed a mismatch at the 3' US: the minus strand DNA
contained a Barn HI site and the plus strand contained a Cla I site from the
displaced fragment. After repair, the CIa I marker remained and resulted in the two

reaches almost 50 percent by age 30, when only 1 percent of the
general population has developed cancer (6). More than 90 percent
of the gene carriers would develop cancer by age 70. While the
syndrome has thus been characterized statistically, identification of
the gene and the mechanisms for the striking cancer predisposition
has been elusive.
Difficulties in cloning the LFS gene arose from a number of
restrictions placed on traditional methods. The accumulation of
informative tissue specimens and data has been hampered by the
rarity of the syndrome, by the high mortality among affected
individuals, and by lack of an unambiguous definition of the
syndrome. In addition, the cancers in relatives without the gene
often cannot be distinguished from cancers associated with the gene.
Linkage studies and searches for constitutional karyotypic alterations in patients with LFS have failed to specify the chromosomal
region on which to focus. Furthermore, these families do not have
any precancerous conditions or associated malformation syndromes
such as aniridia, which was useful in mapping the Wilms tumor gene
(WT1) to chromosome 'lp3 (7). Because of these difficulties, we
targeted potential candidate genes for study.
The class of genes most strongly associated with familial tumors
has been the tumor suppressor genes. The first tumor suppressor
gene to be cloned, the retinoblastoma gene (Rb) (8), seemed an
unlikely candidate for a germ line mutation in LFS because retinoblastoma has not been observed in these families. The second tumor
suppressor gene to be recognized was p53, located on the short arm
of chromosome 17, band p13 (9). Inactivating mutations of p53
have been associated with sporadic osteosarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas, brain tumors, leukemias, and carcinomas of the lung and breast
(10, 11). Together, these tumors also account for more than half of

the cancers in selected series of LFS families. Furthermore, transgenic mice carrying a mutant p53 gene have an increased incidence
of osteosarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas, adenocarcinomas ofthe lung,
and adrenal and lymphoid tumors (12). These tumors all have been
noted in families with LFS. We therefore decided to test whether
families with LFS carry germ line p53 gene mutations.
Germ line p53 gene mutations in LFS families. Skin biopsies
were obtained from three affected and five unaffected relatives in
family 1 (see Fig. 1). Their fibroblasts were grown in short-term
culture, and DNA was extracted by standard techniques (13). The
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the genomic
region encoding exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene (14). This
segment contains a majority of the conserved domains and most of
the mutations found in sporadic tumors (10, 15). The primers used
for amplification were designed to contain Eco RI sites at their 5'
ends so that the 1685-bp amplified fragment could be subcloned for
sequencing. Multiple primers were then used to sequence the entire
genomic region on both strands (16). Each sequencing reaction was
repeated on multiple clones. Three members in family 1 (II-1, II-4,
and II-6) have the wild-type p53 sequence in six out of six clones
(Table 2). These individuals are considered to carry two wild-type
p53 alleles and have no evidence of tumors. DNA from separate
clones representing the five other family members contained both
wild-type p53, and p53 with a C to T mutation at the first
nucleotide of codon 248. These individuals are considered to carry
both a wild-type and a mutant p53 allele in their fibroblasts. Even
though several polymorphisms have been identified in the p53 gene
(17), none has been detected in the five conserved domains (10, 11,
15, 18). These findings are derived from the sequencing of the p53
gene in more than 150 samples of the DNA extracted from

Fig. 2. (A) Position of p53 gene mutations for
families 1 to 5. Sequencing of the region spanning
exons 5 through 8 was performed as described (16).
The region in which all observed mutations occurred
is shown. The boxed-in segment from codons 234 to
258, inclusive, identifies conserved region IV (15).
Each panel demonstrates the particular point mutation within the codon relative to its position within
the rest of the surrounding sequence; wt refers to the
wild-type done sequenced, and "mutP refers to the
mutant done sequenced. The sequences are read from
bottom to top. The letter within a circle identifies the
amino acid to which the corresponding wild-type
amino acid is switched as a result of the base-pair
change. In each of these samples, no other p53 gene
mutations were identified. It should be noted that in
codon 249, base-pair compression occurs causing
two guanine residues to appear as one band. (B)
Conformational changes incurred by the point mutation in codon 248 open up this compression, revealing the true wild-type configuration at 249. Sequencing of the reverse strand of the wild-type clones
reveals the two expected distinct cytosine residues
(29). Sequencing of both strands confirms the guanine-guanine compression at codon 249. Abbreviations for the amino acid residues are: G, Gly; C, Cys;
R, Arg; W, Trp; L, Leu; P, Pro; E, Glu; K, Lys.

constitutional cells (10). The codon 248 mutation, which changes
an arginine to tryptophan, occurs within conserved region IV that
spans codons 234 to 258 (boxed area, Fig. 2). It has been shown
that it is not a polymorphism; in fact, it is the most common p53
mutation in sporadic tumors studied to date (10, 11, 18). The three
affected individuals tested in this family have the codon 248
mutation. The unaffected grandfather (1-2) and his granddaughter
(III-5) also carry the codon 248 mutation and are carriers predicted
to be at high risk of developing cancer.
Mutations in the p53 gene are documented to occur in the
establishment of cells in long-term culture (19, 20). Thus, during in
vitro passage of the LFS fibroblasts, the p53 gene might have
acquired changes not present in the germ line. Although it is
extremely unlikely that all five fibroblast lines acquired the codon
248 mutation, we collected blood from two of the individuals in this
family (11-2 and 11-3) who have breast cancer and also one mutant
p53 allele in their fibroblasts. DNA was extracted from their
lymphocytes after four passages in tissue culture. Lymphocytes from
both sisters have a C to T mutation at the first nucleotide of codon
248 (Table 2). This is the same mutation found in fibroblasts of
these patients.
To support the hypothesis that this p53 mutation represents a
germ line mutation and not artifact ofPCR, we studied segregation
of the p53 chromosome region in family 1. We used YNZ22.1, a
highly polymorphic DNA sequence on chromosome 17p that

identifies variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) sequences (21).
DNA from the eight members of family 1 was digested with Hinf I
and, after DNA (Southern) blot transfer, was hybridized to the
YNZ22.1 probe (22). Five polymorphisms for the YNZ22.1 allele
were present in this family (Fig. 3). Alleles were numbered from 1
through 5 according to size. Five individuals whose constitutional
DNA contains a mutant p53 gene all carry the YNZ22.1 allele No.
3 (Table 2). This demonstrates the co-segregation data confirm that
co-segregation of this YNZ22.1 allele and the mutant gene in the
family. The segregation data confirm members from three generations of family 1 have the identical germ line p53 gene mutation.
We next examined four additional LFS families (Fig. 1, families 2
through 5) for germ line p53 gene mutations. In family 2, lymphocytes and a portion of the breast cancer were available from member
11-6. DNA encoding exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene was first
amplified from the lymphocytes. Mutation of a G to an A at the first
nucleotide of codon 258 was found in three of four clones. This
results in a switch from a glutamic acid to a lysine at this residue.
(Table 2 and Fig. 2). This mutation apparently has not been noted

polymorphism (10, 11, 18). All six clones containing DNA
amplified from the breast cancer had the same mutation at codon
258 of the p53 gene. This suggests that a mutant p53 allele is
present in this patient's constitutional cells, and that the breast
cancer cells lost the remaining wild-type p53 allele. Because the
DNA of this patient was uninformative for two p53 polymorphic
markers and uninformative for the YNZ22. 1 allele, it is difficult to
confirm that the cells in the breast tumor had no remaining
wild-type p53 protein (20, 21).
Osteosarcoma cells, normal tissue adjacent to the tumor, and skin
fibroblasts were obtained from individual III-2 in family 3. Both the
adjacent normal tissue and skin fibroblasts had a mutation of a C to
a T at the first nucleotide of codon 245, which results in cysteine
replacing the glycine at this position. The same mutation was found
in three of four clones analyzed from the individual's osteosarcoma.
In this case, the YNZ22.1 polymorphic probe was informative and
showed a 70 percent reduction of one allele in the tumor sample.
The partial loss ofthe wild-type allele is due to admixture of normal
tissue in this sample (20). This suggests that individual 111-2 in
family 3 has a germ line p53 mutation at codon 245, and that cells
within the tumor lost the remaining wild-type p53 allele.
Lymphocytes from individual III-3 in family 4 were analyzed for
p53 gene mutations. Clones containing amplified DNA encoding
p53 had the same C to T transition at the first nucleotide in codon
248 as found in family 1. The high frequency of codon 248
mutations in sporadic tumors and its presence in two ofthe five LFS
families suggest a propensity to change at this site. Individual III- 1
in family 5 has a germ line mutation at codon 252. In the first
position of this codon there is a T to C change, which results in
proline replacing leucine at this position.
All p53 germ line mutations noted in the LFS families are located
in conserved region IV, where no polymorphisms have been
detected and where nucleotide changes have previously been limited
as a

members of LFS families. Recently, an International Working
Group on LFS was established, and nearly 100 candidate families
have been enrolled. Members of these families can be examined for
germ line p53 mutations. This effort should help clarify the spectrum of cancers attributable to germ line p53 gene alterations. In
addition, gene carriers will be identified among the unaffected
children and older relatives. A determination can also be made of the
family members who are in fact, not carriers. The ability to detect
germ line p53 mutations creates a responsibility to properly use this
information, and to develop strategies for the care of gene carriers at
exceptionally high risk of cancer.
The frequency of individuals in the general population who carry
germ line p53 mutations is undefined. Li-Fraumeni syndrome might
identify only the rare families in which germ line mutations in the
p53 gene are highly penetrant and expressed in multiple tissues. The
role of p53 germ line mutations in human cancer cannot be fully
addressed by assessing its role in familial cancer. In retinoblastoma,
for example, 85 percent of germ line mutation carriers, as identified
by the presence of bilateral tumors, occur de novo (28). A germ line
p53 mutation could occur in a substantial population of children
and young adults who die of the cancer and do not propagate the
gene. We are therefore seeking p53 mutations in individuals and
families who display one or more features of LFS, such as multiple
primary cancers or breast cancer in several young relatives. Those
with a germ line p53 gene mutation are enrolled in a multicenter
registry for further analyses.
In conclusion, we have shown that alterations of the p53 gene
occur not only as somatic mutations in human cancers, but also as
germ line mutations in some cancer-prone families. The frequency of
germ line p53 mutations in cancer patients in the general population
is unknown and merits further study. Both somatic and germ line
mutations also arise in another tumor suppressor gene, the retinoblastoma gene. These finding indicate that the search for additional
tumor suppressor genes can proceed along two parallel research

to tumor cells (10, 11, 18). All the mutations described in Table 2
were confirmed by a second PCR reaction and resequencing the
gene products. Performing the PCR reactions in duplicate allowed
us to overcome the inconsistencies due to the 0.25 percent rate of
base misincorporation documented by others and previously confirmed in our laboratory (10, 23). Germ line p53 mutations were not
identified in seven healthy controls and seven individuals with
sporadic tumors who had no family history of cancer.
Possibility of restictions on germ line p53 mutations. The
half-lives of most mutant p53 proteins are markedly increased in
comparison to the half-life of wild-type p53 protein. This is
primarily a result of a complex they form with the heat shock
proteins (hsc-70) (24). These mutant p53 proteins attain levels
comparable to those known to exert a "trans-dominant loss of
function" effect on wild-type p53 (23, 25). Other rare mutant p53
proteins that fail to form a complex with hsc-70 have a reduced
capacity to override wild-type p53 function in transformation assays
(26). We therefore asked whether such a trans-dominant loss of
function effect of some mutant p53 proteins would restrict the types
of germ line p53 mutations found in LFS families. The level of p53
protein was analyzed by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates from
normal fibroblasts, LFS fibroblasts, and KHOS-240S cells (Fig. 4).
The latter contain a p53 mutation at codon 156. This mutant
protein forms a complex with hsc-70 (27). The high level of p53
protein found in the KHOS-240S cells is representative of the large
amounts of protein found in cells with mutant p53 protein that
complexes the hsc-70 proteins (25). In contrast, the p53 protein
levels in the three LFS fibroblast lines are comparable to those of
wild-type p53. The level of p53 protein in fibroblasts from individuals of 12 LFS families (including the four with documented germ
line p53 mutations analyzed in Fig. 4), were also tested by immunofluorescence studies. All had low fluorescent intensities comparable to cells containing wild-type p53 protein (20). Both the immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies probably indicate a
selection against the p53 gene mutations that stabilize the mutant
p53 protein that exerts a trans-dominant loss of function effect on
the wild-type protein. Screening tests to determine germ line p53
mutations should not rely on methods that assume that the mutations will result in high levels of mutant protein.
Interpreations of the data. The presence of p53 mutations in
the sporadic forms of many human tumors suggests that these
alterations are an important step in the transformation of diverse
cells. All cells in the individuals with LFS that we studied presumably have a single wild-type p53 allele. This finding provides an
opportunity to compare the effects of p53 inactivation on the
development of cancer in different tissues. The most remarkable
feature of this syndrome is the diversity of tumors in the gene
carriers. This suggests that numerous tissues are rendered more
susceptible to transformation when they have only one wild-type
p53 allele. The inactivation of p53 must therefore be at least one of
the rate-limiting steps in the transformation of many tissues. However, tumors in LFS are not evenly distributed by site and do not
follow cancer frequency patterns in the general population (Table
1). For example, breast carcinoma and colon carcinoma have
comparable frequencies in the general population, and frequently
have associated p53 mutations (6). In the LFS families, breast cancer
occurs much more frequently than colon carcinoma (Table 1). The
difference suggests that p53 inactivation is a more critical ratelimiting step in breast carcinoma formation than it is in colon
carcinoma formation. Other patterns of tumor frequencies among
affected individuals with LFS can provide additional clues regarding
the differences in tissue-specific growth control pathways.
The development of molecular diagnostic tests to identify carriers
of germ line p53 mutations provides a new tool for screening

13. All cell lincs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with glucose
at 4.5 g/liter, L-glutamine, and sodium pyruvatc. The medium was supplemented
with 10 percent inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells werc grown at
37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 percent CO2. Genomic DNA was
exacted according to standard techniques (J. Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning:
A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY, ed. 2, 1989). To
extract genomic DNA from blood lymphocytes, wc first scparated the cdls from
other blood components by passage throug a Ficoll-Hypaquc gradient. Tumor
samples were processed after grossly contaminating normal tissue was removed.
The tumor was thcn gently teased and homogenized into small firagents, which
werc resuspended in lysis buffcr. The DNA was extracted from the resuspended
tissue.
14. A 1.7-kb fragment was generated from 0.5 to 2.0 Fg of the genomic DNA
template. The sense and antisense primers used were, respectively. Fl, 5'-ATGC
GAATT CCCCT GCCCTr CAACA AGAT-3' starting at the first codon downstream to intron 4, and R2, 5'-TATAG GAATIT CGTGG TGAGG CTCCC
CITI-3' starting at the ninth codon upstream of intron 8. Each primer had
synthetic Eco RI sites at their S' ends to facilitate doning. The DNA tcmplate and
primers were added to a PCR buffer (DuPont) containing 50 mM tris-HCI (pH
9.5), 1.5 mM magnesium chloride, and 20 mM ammonium sulfate, to which were
added dCTP, dATP, crTP, and dGTP (at 0.2 mM each), and 0.5 U of Rcplinase
(DuPont). The 100-id reaction was amplified in a Perkin-Elmer Thermocycler
(Cetus) for 35 cycles of 940C (1 minute) 55°C (2 minutes), and 720C (3 minutes).
The reaction was initiated with one 80-second cyde at 94°C and ended with a
7-minute step at 720C.

16. Ten reactions were performed for each DNA template, and the PCR products were
pooled and digested with Eco RI, fractionated by electophoresis, and after
acid-phenol extraction and purification from low-melt agarose (New England
Biolabs), fragments werc ligated into a Bluescript vector "PBSK" (Stratagene) that
had been digested with Eco RI and treated with calf alkaline phosphatase. After
transformation, individual clones derived from standard minipreparations were
sequenced in both directions with primers derived from the p53 coding and intron
sequences. Analysis of six dones allows detection of both alleles morc than 98
percent of the time. Thc usc of either 35S-labeled or 32P-labeled nudeotides with
T7 DNA polymerasc yielded high autoradiographic resolution on a 12 percent
polyacryainide gel. The primer SN, 5'-GGITGGCTCTGACrGTA-3', started at
the first codon of cxon 7 and generated the sequence of the region that contained
the mutations described in the text.
