Summary. This paper surveys the literature on familial nonchromaffin paragangliomas and presents the results of a study of
a family with 295 living members.

Introduction
The names adopted in the literature to designate the tumours
described in the present paper, have not been uniform from the
beginning. This discrepancy is largely attributable to a difference of opinion. Originally, the terms glomus tissue and glomus
tumour were used to designate the normal physiological
condition and the hyperplastic condition respectively. The term
glomus was adopted because of the ball-like character of the
tissue when it was examined under the light microscope. This
name was retained later in view of its neutral character. The
problem of embryogenesis of the glomera was initially a controversial matter in the literature. Today it is universally accepted
that the paraganglionic cells, like spinal and sympathetic
ganglia, are derived from the neural crests (Kjaergaard 1973).
Paraganglia belong to two systems, viz. to the orthosympathetic
system and to the parasympathetic system.
The parasympathetic paraganglia are situated along the
course of the parasympathetic nerves (ninth, tenth, and eleventh
cranial nerves), particularly at those points at which they
intersect with the large vessels. The specification nonchromaffin
was added as it was a characteristic of these paraganglia that they
were not stainable by chromates. They show an afferent
(sensory) parasympathetic innervation and their function is
probably chemoreceptive in character (Lattes 1950; Fernandez
et al. 1975).
The terms glomus body and glomus body tumour predominate in the clinical literature, in which a topographic designation is added, such as carotid body and carotid body tumour.
Because of the presumably chemoreceptive function, chemodectoma is also commonly used. In the genetic literature
(McKusick 1978; no. 16800), the name nonchromaffin paraganglioma (NCP), suggested by Lattes and Waltner (1949), is
adopted. This is done to avoid problems of nomenclature
regarding a related clinical picture, e.g. multiple glomus tumours
(McKusick 1978, no. 13800). Multiple glomus tumours are
multiple flesh-coloured to blue nodules in the skin, 0.3 to 3.0 cm
in diameter. They may occasionally involve deeper structures

such as bone. The characteristic histopathological features are
endothelium-lined dilated vascular spaces which are surrounded
by one or more layers of the oval glomus tumour (small muscle)
cells.
The most common localizations of NCP in the region of the
head and neck are the tympanic and jugular glomera, also jointly
designated as glomus jugulotympanicum, the gtomus vagale,
and the carotid glomus. Occasionally there are high cervical
localizations in the region of the arch of the aorta and the branch
of the pulmonary artery, and retroperitoneal localizations in the
region of the branches of the mesenteric artery. The clinical
aspects of this study are discussed in detail elsewhere (van Baars
et al. 1981).

Survey of the Literature
The literature includes 32 papers in which cases of familial NCP
were reported. As shown in Table 1, there were 160 patients, 83
males and 77 females. Eight families were described in sufficient
detail to make it possible to calculate the numbers affected per
generation (Table 2). The ratio of number of patients to the
number of all members examined in the second generation is
34 : 59. In the third generation, 21 patients were detected among
71 descendants of identified patients. The localizations of
tumours described in the literature are given in Table 3.

Family Studies
Subjects and Methods

Four large branches of a family were united into a single pedigree
by genealogical studies. Each branch had its own proband. The
mutual relationships of branches 16.08.06, 16.08.08, 16.08.16,
and 16.12.07 are shown in Fig. 1.
All lineal descendants over 15, subsequently 20 years of age,
were invited to undergo an examination. A total of 162 subjects
were studied. The methods of investigation included otorhinological examination, including palpation of the neck; neurological examination of the cranial nerves; hearing tests; and
scintiscanning of the blood vessels. Dynamic and skeletal
scanning (Ruys et al. 1978; Veldman et al. 1980) were used as
supplementary methods of screening. At the same time blood
from many members of the family was used for the typing of
genetic markers in the search for a possible linkage of the gene
for NCP with some marker.

The results o f clinical studies are s h o w n separately for each

C o m p a r i s o n of the ratio between the individual localizations
detected in the present study (Table 5) a n d those reported in the
literature (Table 3) shows that those localizations which are h a r d
to detect occur less frequently in the literature. This difference
can be a c c o u n t e d for by the more refined methods of detection
used in this study. The group of t u m o u r s of the carotid glomus is
over represented in the literature. The incidence of t u m o u r s of
the glomus vagale in the present study is three times, a n d t h a t of
tumours of the glomus jugulare is twice as high as in the
literature.
Classifications of the t u m o u r s by halves of the b o d y does not
reveal any predilection side n o r site. Nor was there a significant
predilection for specific sites in the female sex. A l t h o u g h the

of 45 years o f life, when the proper m e t h o d s of detection referred
to are used. The sex ratio a m o n g proven cases of familial N C P
reported in the literature is male (M): female (F) = 83:77.
H e r r m a n n (1977) claims that the offspring of female patients
includes a significantly smaller n u m b e r of patients. He actually
states that the n u m b e r of mothers with affected offspring is
significantly smaller than expected in view of the sex ratio.
The 26 patients in the presented family included 20 men and 6
women. This differs significantly from a normal sex ratio
(P > 0.001). Nevertheless, the sex ratio a m o n g members of the
family ( M : F = 86:76; P > 0 . 4 0 ) and the offspring of proven
patients ( M : F = 35:31; P > 0.30) was not actually disturbed.
In examining a family as large as the one described in the
present study, some selection of male patients is indeed f o u n d to
have occurred when viewed in retrospect. The study started with
branches 16.08.06 and 16.08.08, with two propositi that had the
same family-name and were first cousins once removed. The
third b r a n c h o f the family, 16.08.16, was also traced as this
branch had the same family-name. Finally, a fourth branch
(16.12.07) was added, and on inquiry the propositus stated that
his g r a n d m o t h e r had the same family-name as the other
propositi. This m e a n t that there was a selection of male patients
(the quoted n u m b e r e d brothers and a niece), who had patients
a m o n g their offspring with the same name. None the less, it is
possible that the sex difference observed in our study, and
claimed by H e r r m a n n , is actually due to a difference in
penetrance in the two sexes. This is also k n o w n to be the case
with some other autosomal clinical pictures, e.g. Alport's
syndrome.
The results obtained in the marker gene studies show that
absolute linkage (0% recombination) is out of the question using
those markers which supplied enough information. Even on a
5% r e c o m b i n a t i o n level Rhesus, AK, GPT, Pi, GC, and K M are
found to be excluded. If slightly more information was available,
even 10% recombination would also be excluded for a n u m b e r of
genetic markers. There is one notable exception to this interpretation o f the lod scores and that is the positive score for low
recombination fractions with LU. The collection of more data on
this point and on Secretor would be desirable, but will be
hampered by the late (45 years) penetrance of NCP. A close
linkage would give an optimal possibility of early diagnosis.
