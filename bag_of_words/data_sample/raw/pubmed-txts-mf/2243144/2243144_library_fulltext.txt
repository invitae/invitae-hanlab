Abstract
Schindler disease is a recently recognized infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy resulting from the deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, a-N-acetylgalctosaminidase (a-GalNAc).
The recent isolation and expression of the full-length cDNA
encoding a-GalNAc facilitated the identification of the molecular lesions in the affected brothers from family D, the first
cases described with this autosomal recessive disease. Southern and Northern hybridization analyses of DNA and RNA
from the affected homozygotes revealed a grossly normal aGalNAc gene structure and normal transcript sizes and
amounts. Therefore, the a-GalNAc transcript from an affected
homozygote was reverse-transcribed, amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequenced. A single G to A
transition at nucleotide 973 was detected in multiple subclones
containing the PCR products. This point mutation resulted in a
glutamic acid to lysine substitution in residue 325 (E325K) of
the a-GalNAc polypeptide. The base substitution was confirmed by dot blot hybridization analyses of PCR-amplified
genomic DNA from family members with allele-specific oligonucleotides. Furthermore, transient expression of an a-GalNAc construct containing the E325K mutation resulted in the
expression of an immunoreactive polypeptide which had no
detectable a-GalNAc activity. (J. Clin. Invest. 1990.86:17521756.) Key words: a-N-acetylgalactosaminidase neuroaxonal

ited as an autosomal recessive trait, leads to the tissue accumulation and increased urinary excretion ofglycopeptides and
oligosaccharides containing a-N-acetylgalactosaminyl moieties (4, 5). The disorder was described in two brothers from
family D who were the offspring of a consanguineous couple of
German descent. The affected infants' development appeared
normal for the first 9 to 12 mo of age. In the second year of life,
they experienced a period of developmental delay which was
followed by rapid psychomotor regression. By 3-4 yr of age,
the progressive neurologic impairment led to cortical blindness, myoclonic seizures, spasticity, decorticate posturing, and
profound psychomotor retardation. A cortical biopsy revealed
the presence of"spheroids" in terminal axons, the unique neuropathology which classified this disease as a neuroaxonal dystrophy (2, 6). These clinical and morphologic manifestations
in the two affected brothers were essentially identical to those
in patients with Seitelberger disease, an infantile form of neuroaxonal dystrophy (6); however, the finding of normal a-GalNAc activity in eight unrelated patients with Seitelberger disease (2) demonstrated that Schindler disease was biochemically distinct and that the infantile neuroaxonal dystrophies
were genetically heterogeneous (2).
The affected homozygotes with Schindler disease had levels
of a-GalNAc activity that were less than 1% of normal in
various sources as assayed with the recently synthesized substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-a-N-acetylgalactosaminide
(4MU-a-GalNAc) (2, 7). Their parents had intermediate levels
of activity consistent with being obligate heterozygotes for this
autosomal recessive disorder. Using monospecific rabbit antihuman a-GalNAc antibodies, immunoblots of fibroblast extracts from the affected brothers revealed no detectable immunoreactive enzyme protein, while extracts from their parents
and a normal brother had two immunoreactive peptide species, the 48-kD monomeric and 117-kD dimeric forms of aGalNAc observed in normal cultured fibroblasts and in preparations of the purified human enzyme (2, 8). These findings
suggested that the a-GalNAc mutation in this family markedly
altered the enzyme's activity and stability.
The recent isolation, sequencing, and expression of the
full-length cDNA encoding human a-GalNAc (8) permitted
investigation of the molecular lesion in the a-GalNAc gene
that causes Schindler disease in this consanguineous family.
The a-GalNAc cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 411 amino
acids including a signal peptide of 17 residues. Studies of
human a-GalNAc biosynthesis indicated that the precursor

polypeptide was cotranslationally glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum, and following carbohydrate modifications
and phosphorylation of its high mannose-type oligosaccharide
structures in the Golgi, the mature glycopeptide of 394 amino

acids was trafficked to the lysosome via the mannose-6-phosphate receptor-mediated pathway (9). Presumably, the mature
glycopeptide is dimerized to form the 11 7-kD active form in
the Golgi.
In this communication, we report the specific missense
mutation in the a-GalNAc coding region which causes an infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy in this consanguineous family.
This base substitution was confirmed by analysis of genomic
DNA from family members and by transient expression studies. Of interest was the fact that inactive enzyme protein expressed in COS- 1 cells was immunologically detectable,
whereas no cross-reacting immunological material (CRIM)
was present in cultured fibroblasts from the patients.

Methods
Cell lines. Primary cultures of fibroblasts and lymphoblasts were established from skin biopsies and peripheral blood samples obtained
from the family D members with Schindler disease and from normal
controls with informed consent. The COS-1 cell lines were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The
fibroblasts, lymphoblasts, and COS-1 cell lines were grown in RPMI
1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin,
and I mg/ml streptomycin by standard procedures (10).
Assays ofa-GalNAc activity and protein. The a-GalNAc activity in
COS- I cells was determined with the synthetic fluorogenic substrate
4MU-a-GalNAc (7) as previously described (2). Protein concentration
was determined by the fluorescamine assay (11). Immunobolt analyses
of a-GalNAc in transfected COS- I cells were performed using monospecific rabbit anti-human antibodies as described (2, 8).
Southern and Northern hybridization analyses. Genomic DNA was
isolated from at least 106 cultured lymphoblasts (12). The DNA was
digested with restriction endonucleases (e.g., Bam HI, Pst I, Eco RI,
Taq I; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), electrophoresed in 1%
agarose, transferred to BioTrace RP charge-modified nylon 66 binding
matrix (Gelman Sciences, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) (13), and analyzed
using the nick-translated a-GalNAc cDNA as a probe (14). To determine the relative sizes and amounts of the 2.2- and 3.6-kb a-GalNAc
transcripts (8), total RNA was isolated from at least 108 cultured lymphoblasts (15). RNA samples were electrophoresed in I% agarose/formaldehyde denaturing gels (16), transferred to the BioTrace membranes described above, and analyzed with the radiolabeled a-GalNAc
riboprobe synthesized with SP6 polymerase from the a-GalNAc 2.2-kb
cDNA cloned into the pGEM 4Z vector (Promega Biotec, Madison, WI).
DNA amplification and sequencing of the mutant allele. Sense and
antisense oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify the entire coding region of the a-GalNAc gene in two overlapping fragments were
synthesized on a model 380B DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems,
Inc., Foster City, CA). As shown in Fig. 1, the 5' region of the a-GalNAc transcripts (cDNA nucleotide [nt] -54 to 689 [8]) was amplified
using the 32-mer sense primer, P1 (5'-AGTAGTGAATTCCTGATACACGCAGACCAGAT-3'), corresponding to a-GalNAc nt-34 to
-53 with an additional 12 nt which included an Eco RI site and a
32-mer antisense primer, P2 (5'-AGTAGTAAGCTTTTCAGGATGGAGAGCTCGCT-39,corresponding to a-GalNAc cDNA nt 670-689
with a Hind III site for force subcloning. The 3' region of the coding sequence (cDNA nt 595 to 1292) was amplified using a 32-mer
sense primer, P3 (5'-AGTAGTGAATTCAGGGTGAACTACAGTCTGCT-3), corresponding to nt 595-614 with an Eco RI site
and a 32-mer antisense primer, P4 (5'-AGTAGTAAGCTTGCTCCATGGTCTAGGCTCAG-3), corresponding to nt 1273-1292 and
containing a Hind III site. Total RNA (10 jg) was reverse-transcribed
to cDNA using the BRL cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bethesda Research
Laboratories, Gaithersberg, MD). One-fourth of the cDNA product
was polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified (17) using the Gene-

Figure 1. Strategy for the identification of the specific molecular lesion in Schindler disease. Total RNA was isolated from lymphoblasts
and reverse-transcribed to cDNA using oligo dT and reverse transcriptase. The a-GaINAc coding region was PCR-amplified in two
overlapping fragments, cloned into the Ml 3 sequencing vectors, and
sequenced in both orientations. See text for details.

Amp DNA Amplification Reagent Kit (Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk,
CT) and 1 jiM of each primer. Each of the 30 PCR cycles consisted of
denaturation at 940C for 1 min; annealing at 370C for 2 min; and
extension at 60'C for 7 min. Each PCR product was phenol extracted,
ethanol precipitated, resuspended in 20 ul H20, and then 2 gl was
analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1.8% agarose gel. The remaining 18 td
was digested with Eco RI and Hind III and force-subcloned into the
M 13 mpl 8 and 19 vectors (18). Clones containing the PCR products
were identified by plaque hybridization using the nick-translated aGalNAc cDNA (14). Single-stranded template was isolated (18) from
six separate M 13 clones, and each was sequenced in both orientations
by the dideoxy chain-termination method (19) using universal and
a-GalNAc-specific primers.
Oligonucleotide hybridization ofgenomic DNA. Genomic DNAs (1
jig) from affected homozygotes, their obligate heterozygous parents,
and normal individuals were PCR-amplified using primers that
flanked the region of the mutation by the conditions described above.
The 5' sense primer was a 20-mer (5'-TGATGTCCACAGACCTGCGT-3') corresponding to nt 842-861 and the 3' antisense
primer was a 20-mer (5'-TCAGCTGCAGGACCGATATG-3') corresponding to nt 1005-1024 of the a-GaINAc full-length cDNA,
pAGB-3 (8). Normal and mutation-specific oligonucleotide probes
(2 1-mers) were synthesized with the sequences 5'-TCTCTCATCGAAGTGTACATG-3' and 5'-TCTCTCATCAAAGTGTACATG-3',
respectively. Dot blots were denatured, hybridized, and washed as
described (20).
Computer-assisted analyses. Local secondary structure for both the
normal and mutant enzymes were predicted by the algorithms of Chou
and Fasman (21) and Gamier et al. (22) using the University of Wisconsin Computer Group software (23). A region of 20 amino acids
surrounding the site of the glutamic acid to lysine substitution was used
for the prediction of the local secondary structure.
Construction of the mutant cDNA and transient expression of the
mutation in CC)S-J cells. A Bam HI-Kpn I fragment containing the G
to A substitution from an M 13 clone was used as a cassette to replace
the corresponding region in the full-length a-GalNAc cDNA (8). The
sequence of this construct was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing, and
then the construction was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression
vector p91023(B) (24) kindly provided by Dr. R. J. Kaufmann, Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA. COS- 1 cells were transfected with the
mutant construct, designated p91-AGB-973A (25), harvested at 72 h
posttransfection, and then assayed for activity and immunoreactive
protein as previously described (2).

Results

Molecular characterization of the a-GalNAc mutation in family D. In order to characterize the nature of the mutation in
family D, Southern analysis was performed with four restriction endonucleases on genomic DNA from the affected homozygotes, their obligate heterozygous parents, and unrelated
normal individuals. No obvious gene rearrangements were
observed (data not shown). It is interesting that the family D
members were polymorphic at the a-GalNAc locus for two
restriction endonuclease sites, Bam HI and Taq I; these polymorphic sites were found in 16 of 40 (45%) and 2 of 76 (2.6%)
normal Caucasian alleles, respectively. Northern analysis of
total RNA from family D members and from normal individuals revealed the presence of the two a-GalNAc transcripts of
2.2 kb and - 3.6 kb. Since the affected brothers had transcripts of normal size and abundancy, the possibility of promotor, mRNA processing, or stability mutations was excluded. These findings, and the fact that no a-GalNAc immunoreactive enzyme protein was detected in fibroblasts from the
affected homozygotes, suggested that the mutation causing
Schindler disease was most likely due to point mutations or
small insertions or deletions in the coding region of the a-GalNAc gene.
To identify the a-GalNAc mutation in this family, total
RNA isolated from the cultured lymphoblasts of an affected
sibling was reverse transcribed, PCR-amplified, and sequenced
in both orientations as described above (Fig. 1). Sequence
analysis of all 12 subclones revealed a G to A transition at
nucleotide 973 which caused a glutamic acid to lysine substitution at residue 325 (Fig. 2). This substitution, designated
E325K, was confirmed by hybridization of allele-specific oligonucleotides with PCR-amplified genomic DNA from the
affected homozygotes, the obligate heterozygous parents and
normal individuals. As shown in Fig. 3, the mutation-specific
oligonuceotide hybridized only with the amplified genomic

finding, the genomic PCR product from each of their parents
hybridized with both the normal and mutation-specific oligonucleotides.
Expression ofthe mutation in COS-I cells. To further characterize this mutation, the Bam HI-Kpn I fragment (nt
921-1193) from an Ml 3 subclone containing the mutant allIle was introduced as a cassette into the full-length pAGB-3
cDNA. The mutated cDNA, designated pAGB-973A, was sequenced and then subcloned into the eukaryotic expression
vector p91023(B). This expression construct, p91-AGB-973A,
was transfected into COS-1 cells, and 72 h after transfection
the cells were harvested and extracts were assayed for a-GalNAc activity and immunoreactive enzyme protein. Immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of immunologically detectable protein with a subunit molecular weight of 48 kD (Fig.
4). However, 4MU-a-GalNAc activity in COS-1 cells was not
increased above endogenous COS- 1 cell levels, whereas the

Secondary structure analyses. Computer-assisted regional
secondary structural analysis of residues 310 to 330 predicted
differences in the normal and E325K structures (21, 22). As
illustrated in Fig. 5, the glutamic acid to lysine substitution in
E325K extended a ,-pleated sheet region 5' to the mutation,
and created a short a-helical structure which included the mutation.

Discussion
Schindler disease is the only neuroaxonal dystrophy in which
the biochemical defect has been identified. Although the deficient a-GalNAc activity results in the lysosomal accumulation
and urinary excretion of a-GalNAc-containing oligosaccharides and glycopeptides, the nature of the biochemical alterations in the brain that cause the unique neuroaxonal patholNH2

ogy has not been determined. The recent isolation of the
full-length cDNA encoding aGalNAc permitted the characterization of the molecular lesion causing the enzymatic defect in
the first family with this inherited disorder. Southern and
Northern hybridization analyses of DNA and RNA from the
affected homozygotes revealed no gross chromosomal rearrangements and transcripts of normal size and abundancy.
Subsequent reverse-transcription, amplification, and sequencing of the a-GalNAc transcript from an affected homozygote
revealed a single G to A transition at nt 973 in the coding
region. This transition, which predicted a glutamic acid to
lysine substitution at residue 325 of the a-GalNAc polypeptide
(E325K), was confirmed in genomic DNA from both affected
homozygotes and their obligate heterozygous parents using
allele-specific oligonucleotides. These results indicated that the
affected homozygotes were homoallelic for this mutation,
consistent with the fact that the affected homozygotes were the
offspring of a consanguineous marriage.
The nonconservative E325K mutation altered the enzyme
polypeptide and tertiary conformation (e.g., by the insertion of
a short a-helical region as predicted in Fig. 5) such that no
activity or immunoreactive enzyme protein was detectable in
cultured cells from the affected homozygotes. In contrast,
transfection of the mutant p9 I-AGB-973A a-GalNAc cDNA
into COS- I cells resulted in the transient expression of a polypeptide which was immunoreactive, but had no detectable
enzymatic activity toward the specific 4MU-a-GalNAc substrate. The fact that fibroblast extracts from the affected homozygotes were CRIM-negative suggested that the E325K
mutation caused the enzyme polypeptide to be unstable and
rapidly degraded in cultured cells and, presumably, in vivo. A
similar finding of a CRIM-negative mutant protein in fibroblasts that was immunologically detectable when transiently
expressed in COS- 1 cells has been observed for a mutation in
the vitamin D receptor gene (26). The detection of immunoreactive enzyme in the COS- 1 cells most likely reflects the
"pulsed" synthesis of the altered human polypeptide that then
is degraded due to instability and/or the inability of the polypeptide subunits to associate into more stable multimeric
forms. This may be the case for the a-GalNAc polypeptide
since the homodimeric form is extremely stable (8). Thus, the
classification of a mutation as CRIM- negative based on studies of the patient's cells or tissues does not imply that the
enzyme is not synthesized. Subsequent stable expression of
normal and mutant constructs may provide sufficient quantities of these enzyme proteins for comparison of their physical
and kinetic properties. For example, such studies may determine if the E325K mutation alters subunit association, the
interaction with different substrates, and/or other factors in
the catalytic complex.
The identification of this molecular lesion in the family D
homozygotes will permit accurate heterozygote detection for
relatives using allele-specific oligonucleotides. Molecular heterozygote diagnosis will be particularly valuable since there
was significant overlap in the ranges of enzymatic activities in
various sources for family D obligate heterozygotes and normal individuals. Moreover, since family D is from a small
inbred village in which previous children with the Schindler
phenotype were known, screening can be performed to identify carriers and provide the opportunity for accurate prenatal
diagnosis, if requested.

Although Schindler disease is the only neuroaxonal dystrophy in which the biochemical and molecular defects have
been identified, the nature of the accumulated neuronal substrate(s) and the pathophysiologic events that lead to the
unique spheroid formations in the distal axons remain unknown. Further studies of this disease may provide insight into
the normal role of a-Ga1NAc-containing glycoconjugates and
a-GalNAc in neuronal metabolism and/or transport.
