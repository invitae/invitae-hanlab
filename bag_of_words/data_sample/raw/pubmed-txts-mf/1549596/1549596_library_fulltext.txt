The ability to identify mutations on a routine basis allows
precise establishment of carrier status in affected families and
permits accurate prenatal diagnosis. In families with no gross
dystrophin gene rearrangement, diagnosis of carriers currently relies on linkage analysis. Due to the high mutation
rate, the mutation has often originated within a living family
member; hence relatives carrying a high-risk haplotype may
not carry the mutation. Furthermore, recombination occurs
within the dystrophin gene in up to 12% of meioses (9),
necessitating the analysis of flanking markers. Direct diagnosis would not be subject to either of these problems.
We have analyzed the entire coding sequence of the
dystrophin gene from seven patients with DMD or intermediate muscular dystrophy (IMD). In each case one mutation
is clearly sufficient to cause the disease. The approach we
have used permits direct diagnosis to be extended to virtually
any case of DMD and BMD and is applicable to many other
complex tissue-specific genes.

Derming the range of mutations in genes that
ABSTRACT
cause human disease is essential to determine the mechanisms
of genetic variation and the function of gene domains and to
perform precise carrier and prenatal diagnosis. The mutations
in one-third of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients remain
unknown as they do not involve gross rearrangements of the
dystrophin gene. The size and complexity of the gene have
prohibited the systematic definition of point mutations. We
have developed a method for the identification of these mutations by nested amplification, chemical mismatch detection,
and sequencing of reverse transcripts of trace amounts of
dystrophin mRNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes. Analysis of the entire coding region (11 kilobases) in seven patients
has resulted in detection of a sequence change in each case that
is clearly sufficient to cause the disease. All mutations should
cause premature translational termination, and the resulting
phenotypes are thus equivalent to those caused by frameshifting deletions. The results support a particular functional
importance for the C-terminal region of dystrophin. Application of this approach to mutation detection will extend direct
carrier and prenatal diagnosis to virtually every affected
family.

The spectrum of mutations that cause genetic disease exhibits
unusual variation in some genes. Mutations in the dystrophin
(1) and steroid sulfatase (2) loci, for example, are predominantly heterogeneous deletions, whereas mutations in anticoagulant factors VIII and IX are mostly point mutations (3).
Analysis of the types of structural alteration that affect the
structure, expression, stability, or function of the gene product can offer insight into the mechanisms by which such
mutations arise and the mode of action of the normal gene and
its encoded protein.
Mutations in the human dystrophin gene are associated
with common (1 in 3500 boys) X chromosome-linked muscular dystrophies of wide-ranging phenotype, from the mild
Becker (BMD) form to the severe Duchenne (DMD) form.
Because the disease frequency is maintained by recurrent
mutation, many different mutants exist. Two-thirds of these
mutations consist of large deletions (4), which have a nonrandom distribution, being clustered in two hotspots. In
general (5), deletions resulting in a translational frameshift
are generally associated with DMD, whereas those that may
remove large portions of the protein but maintain the reading
frame are associated with BMD (6). The remaining one-third
of mutations have not been characterized. Their identification represents a formidable challenge because of the large
size and complexity of the dystrophin gene [11 kilobases (kb)
of coding sequence (7) distributed between 79 exons (R.G.R.,
A. J. Coffey, M.B., and D.R.B., unpublished data) across 2.3
megabases of genome (4)]. To date only one point mutation
has been reported (8), where immunological analysis of
truncated dystrophin from muscle biopsy material allowed
prior localization of the mutation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients. Patients with DMD or IMD were selected solely
on the basis that no deletion was detected by a multiplex PCR
(10), which is capable of identifying 98% of deletions. Phenotypes are indicated at the right of Fig. 3 (MR, mental
retardation), in the format "diagnosis, age of diagnosis/age of
confinement to wheelchair/current age (years)" (-, still
mobile). Patient 2 only became wheelchair-bound at the age
of 14 years, 3 months, whereas patient 7 is still able to walk
two miles at the age of 10 years. Results of muscle dystrophin
analysis were available in two cases. No dystrophin was
detected in muscle biopsy from patient 5 with polyclonal
antiserum P6 (T. G. Sherratt and P. N. Strong, personal
communication) (raised against amino acids 2814-3028) or
from patient 4 with monoclonal antibody Dy4/6D3 (G. Dickson, personal communication) (raised against a murine polypeptide corresponding to amino acids 1164-1397) (11).
Reverse Transcription (RT) and Nested PCR. Total RNA
was prepared from peripheral blood lymphocytes (12). Samples (200-500 ng) of total lymphocyte RNA were reversetranscribed using primer DMDXb (X = 1-11; primer nomenclature below). A PCR mix containing primers DMDXa and
DMDXb was added to the products and 30 cycles of PCR
(13-16) were performed. Two microliters of the products was
added to a second mix containing primer DMDXc or DMDXe
and primer DMDXd or DMDXf, and PCR was repeated (17).
Eight microliters of the final product was electrophoresed in
a 4% polyacrylamide minigel containing ethidium bromide.
Products were gel-purified from 4% polyacrylamide minigels
using DEAE membrane. Primers [nomenclature: X, reaction
1-11; DMDXa and DMDXb (outer set), 5' and 3', respectively; DMDXc and DMDXd (inner set), 5' and 3', respectively; DMDXe, 5' inner primer for reaction Xb; DMDXf, 3'

promoter reaction (18) and the following: DMD1d, DMD7a
and DMD7d, DMD8d, DMD10d-DMD10f, DMDSe and
DMD5f, DMD11a-DMD11d (sequences available on request).
Characterization of Mutations. For each mismatch reaction, a probe was amplified from cloned cDNA (1, 19) using
the same primers as were used for secondary PCR. The probe
was labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [y-32PIATP
and was hybridized to gel-purified products from the nested
RT-PCR. The hybrid mixture was then divided into two and
subjected to chemical modification of mismatched pyrimidine residues (20, 21) with osmium tetroxide (1 mM osmium
tetroxide/370 mM pyridine, 370C for 2 hr) and with hydroxylamine (2.3 M hydroxylamine hydrochloride/1.67 M diethylamine, 370C for 2 hr). The DNA was cleaved adjacent to
modified residues with 1 M piperidine at 90'C for 30 min.
Products were electrophoresed in a denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. Direct sequencing (22, 23)
of regions identified by chemical mismatch detection was
performed using PCR primers or internal oligonucleotides
(sequences available on request).
Determination of Intron Sequence. In instances where mutations lay near the ends of exons or in introns, intron
sequences were required for amplification of genomic DNA.
These were determined by sequence analysis of vectorette
PCR products (24) derived from yeast artificial chromosome
clones containing parts of the dystrophin gene (25) using
exon-specific primers (R.G.R., A. J. Coffey, M.B., and
D.R.B., unpublished data).

date deleterious mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing or restriction analysis of amplified genomic DNA
(Fig. 2B).
Sequence Differences in the Dystrophin Gene. Fourteen
distinct sequence changes were identified (Fig. 3B). Point
mutations generating in-frame termination codons were
found in four patients (patient 1; patient 2, Fig. 2A; patient 3;
patient 5, Fig. 1B). Two of these changes (in patients 3 and
5) are C -- T transitions in CpG dinucleotides. For example,
mismatch analysis of reaction 10a with either osmium tetroxide or hydroxylamine in patient 5 resulted in the appearance
of a 342-nt band (Fig. 1B). Direct sequencing revealed a C -T change at nucleotide 10316 in the cDNA sequence, which
converts codon 3370 from an arginine codon to a termination
codon (Fig. 3B). Similarly, mismatch analysis of reaction 9 in
patient 3 using hydroxylamine resulted in the appearance of
a band of 374 nt. Direct sequencing revealed a C -- T
transition at nucleotide 9152, which converts codon 2982
from arginine to a termination codon. In patient 7 a band of
238 nt was detected in reaction lOb (Fig. 1B). This corresponded to deletion of the single nucleotide T10662, resulting
in a frameshift mutation that should cause premature termination of translation 10 amino acids after Pro3484 (Fig. 2C).
In patients 4 (Fig. 1A) and 6 the mutations were betrayed
by aberrantly sized PCR products. The respective missing
sequences were found by PCR to be absent from the genome
of patient 6 (exons 73-76; nucleotides 10537-11129) but
present in that of patient 4. Intron sequences adjacent to the
exon missing from the transcript of patient 4 (exon 68;
nucleotides 10016-10182) were determined by analysis of
vectorette PCR products derived from yeast artificial chromosome clone 10-1 [which contains exons encoding the 3' 5.5
kb of the transcript (25)]. Using primers specific for the intron
sequences, the boundaries of the exon were amplified from
patient 4 and the splice signals were sequenced. The acceptor
site and branch site were intact, but the donor site GT was
mutated to GA (Fig. 2B). This result supports the "exon
definition" model (26, 27), in which mutation of a donor site
in the absence of nearby "cryptic" donor sites is expected to

RESULTS
Amplification products from reverse-transcribed RNA (Fig.
1A) or genomic DNA were screened for sequence differences
from normal cDNA (7, 19) using chemical mismatch detection (20, 21) (Fig. 1B). In each case, the size of the chemical
cleavage product indicated the approximate position of the
mismatch. Changes were characterized by sequencing the
amplified RT-PCR products (7, 19) (Fig. 2 A and C). Candi-

FIG. 2. (A) Direct sequence analysis of a region -240 bp from the end of reaction 5b from patient 2, which was indicated by mismatch analysis
to differ from the wild-type sequence. The sequence shows a C -- T change 233 bp from the 5' end of 5b. Codons 1848-1853 of the normal
sequence are presented. (B) Sequence of the boundary between exon 68 and intron 68, amplified from the genomic DNA of patient 4. The donor
splice site is mutated, resulting in omission of exon 68 from the mRNA (Fig. 1A). (C) Sequence of a region -240 bp from the end of reaction

cause exon skipping. The loss of sequence from the transcripts causes frameshifts in both patients. Thus premature
termination of translation is expected to occur in all seven
cases.
Several changes appeared repeatedly and thus represent

polymorphisms (Arg1745 -* His, Lys2366-* Gln, Asn2576 -)
Asn)-the first two have been reported previously as sequence differences between two cDNA clones (28); the third
reported in ref. 15. Lys2366 -* Gln is found in 26% of
chromosomes (29). Gly882-- Asp, Ser,007-- Ser, Thr1245 -*
Ile, and Glu2585 -* Glu appear once only. These are likely to
be rare neutral variants, as they occupy positions that are
poorly conserved between species (30) and between repeats
in the same species (31).
Alternative Splicing May Moderate the Severe Phenotype.
Fig. 4 shows products of reaction Sb from patient 2 and from
a normal sample. The predominant product in the normal
sample (360 bp) includes exons 38 and 39. There are three
products from patient 2. The faint middle band (360 bp)
corresponds to a product that includes exon 38 and a copy of
exon 39 containing the mutation Gln1851 -s Term. Sequence
analysis of the predominant smaller band (222 bp) shows that
it lacks exon 39 (nucleotides 5657-5794, amino acids 18171862). Loss of this exon thus eliminates the nonsense mutation from this alternatively spliced transcript, while the
reading frame is maintained. A very small proportion of
alternatively spliced transcript was observed in normal samples. The highest band was found to be an anomalously
migrating heteroduplex molecule, commonly observed in the
presence of mixtures of related products that differ in length.
Patient 2 has an unexpectedly mild phenotype in view of
the position of the termination codon in this case. The
alternatively spliced transcript that is found in lymphocytes
would encode a polypeptide with a small interstitial deletion.
If this transcript (analogous to that found in BMD patients
was

with in-frame deletions) is present in his muscle tissue it
would account for his milder phenotype.
Direct Diagnosis. Sequence from intron 21 was determined
using a vectorette PCR product from yeast artificial chromosome clone 21-1 (25). Genomic DNA samples from relatives
of patient 1 were amplified using primers specific for exon 21
and intron 21. The products were gel purified and sequenced
on the antisense strand using A and C reactions only (Fig. 5).
The mutant sequence (A) is present in the patient (track 6A)
and his mother (track SA), in conjunction with the wild-type
sequence (track 5C), whereas the grandmother (tracks 4A,
4C) and other family members have the wild-type sequence
(C) alone. This defines the origin of mutation. Individual 1,
who has inherited the same maternal haplotype as individual
5 and had consequently been assigned a high carrier risk,
does not have this mutation on the basis of direct diagnosis.

DISCUSSION
Dystrophin is a large protein with homology to the a-actinin
and a-spectrin families (7). Although its precise function is
unknown, a number of results (31-33) have suggested that
rod-like dystrophin homodimers may form a flexible hexagonal lattice that is attached to the inner surface of the muscle
plasma membrane via associations with other proteins. In
this study, one mutation was found in each patient that leads
to premature translation termination and is therefore presumed to have caused the disease. Together with the evidence from deletions and the mutation reported by Bulman et
al. (8) (Glu157 -- Term), the results indicate that serious
disruption of dystrophin function is generally achieved by
truncation.
The mutations reported here result in loss of progressively
smaller segments of the C terminus. The severe phenotype of
patient 6 demonstrates that loss of the C-terminal 242 amino
acids of dystrophin is critical to function and/or stability. The

phenotype of patient 7 is somewhat milder. His protein
should lack only the last 201 amino acids (less than half of the
C-terminal domain). This suggests that the region defined by
the structural difference between the truncated dystrophin
proteins of patients 6 and 7-i.e., amino acids 3444-3485-is
of functional importance.
Diagnosis of the one-third of DMD cases without deletions
has hitherto only been possible using linked restriction fragment length polymorphisms. This indirect approach suffers
the risk of misdiagnosis as a result of the high degree of
crossover observed in the dystrophin gene (11) and is not
applicable to isolated cases. Detection of mutations by the
approach described here enables efficient (one person-week

per patient) establishment of the appropriate assay in each
family for direct carrier and prenatal diagnosis. An example

is shown in Fig. 4, in which the carrier status of the patient's
mother (positive status) and aunt (negative status) of the
patient was established conclusively. This strategy permits
direct diagnosis of virtually every case of DMD and BMD.
This approach permits scanning of the complete coding
sequence of a complex tissue-specific gene for a comprehensive range of mutations, including coding sequence changes,
splice site mutations, and gross gene rearrangements, using
a venous blood sample as its starting material. The use of
mismatch detection to detect point mutations in amplified
products of ectopic transcripts can also be applied to other
diseases, as has been shown for example in hemophilia A (34)
and Hunter syndrome (R. H. Flomen, P. M. Green, D.R.B.,
F. Giannelli, and E. P. Green, unpublished data). Although
its application to autosomal disorders may be complicated by
the additional presence of a normal gene, there is evidence
that ectopic dystrophin transcripts in female lymphocytes
originate from both copies of the gene (ref. 14; R.G.R.,
unpublished results) and that chemical mismatch analysis can
easily detect mutations in a heterozygous state (e.g., ref. 35).
