Abstract
The genes of seven structural mutants of antithrombin III
(ATIII), presenting either defective serine protease reactivity
or abnormal heparin binding, were analyzed. The polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the corresponding
gene exon and the mutation was identified by either dot blot
analysis using a battery of allele-specific oligonucleotide
probes or sequencing.
Variants Paris and Paris 2 were identified as Arg 47 Cys
mutations, and Clichy, Clichy 2, and Franconville were found
to be Pro 41 Leu mutations. All five are heparin binding-site
variants. ATIII Avranches is an Arg 393 His mutation and
ATIII Charleville is an Ala 384 Pro mutation. These two mutations impair the reactive site of the molecule.
ATIII Charleville is a new mutation of the reactive center,
as predicted by previous biochemical data. The position of this
new mutation, together with the other previously described
mutations of the reactive center, sheds light on the molecular
function of this site in inhibiting thrombin.
Finally, genomic amplification by PCR is a powerful technique for the fast identification of antithrombin III mutations
and their homozygous/heterozygous status, and should be
useful for predicting thrombotic risk.

Introduction
Qualitatively deficient antithrombin III (ATIII),' a circulating
glycoprotein that plays a major role in the physiological inhibition of blood coagulation, is a classical but rare cause of thrombosis.

Identification of the mutation responsible for this deficiency is important for at least two major reasons: (a) to demonstrate a correlation between clinical events, generally recurrent thromboembolisms, and a particular molecular defect of
antithrombin III; (b) to provide a better understanding of the

structural features responsible for the function of the protein's
heparin binding site located near
the NH2 terminus (1), which interacts with heparin to modify
the affinity of antithrombin for its protease (2), and the
COOH-terminal reactive site, which forms a covalent complex
with thrombin after cleavage of the Arg 393-Ser 394 bond (3).
Identification of these mutations was, until recently, quite
difficult. But the cloning and sequencing of the ATIII cDNA
and gene (4-7), together with rapid improvements in the techniques of molecular biology (enzymatic amplification of genomic DNA plus dot-blot analysis with specific oligonucleotide
probes) now allow direct investigation of ATIII gene abnormalities.
This report describes the diagnosis of the mutation in seven
families presenting with a qualitative antithrombin deficit.
Analysis of these patients provides new insights into the structure and the function of ATIII and the resulting data give a
clear indication of the thrombotic risk associated with each
mutation.

Methods
Patients
Five ATIII variants, referred to as heparin binding-site variants (HBS
variants), were defined by their low antiprotease activity (< 50%) in the
presence but not the absence of heparin and normal immunoreactive
ATIII. The propositi of ATIII Paris (8) and Paris 2 (9) presented with
severe thrombotic complication, but all the other family members
having the protein abnormality were asymptomatic. None of the three
other cases had thrombosis. The Clichy abnormality was detected in a
24-yr-old woman presenting with a thoracic outlet syndrome (10). The
Franconville variant was diagnosed in a 25-yr-old woman who presented with a retroplacental hemorrhage, which led to fetal death in the
7th mo of pregnancy. No relationship could be established between
this clinical event and the defective ATIII. Her mother and two sisters
had the same protein abnormality but no thrombotic history; one
brother was unaffected. The Clichy 2 variant was discovered fortuitously in a 25-yr-old woman before she started oral contraception. She
had no personal or familial history of thrombosis. Three members of
the ATIII Alger family (11) were also tested, and used as positive
controls. One was homozygous, and the other two were heterozygous,
for the Arg 47 Cys mutation. The incidence ofdeep venous thrombosis
(DVT) in the heparin binding-site variants of our series, together with
those in the literature, is shown in Table I.
Two variants, referred to as reactive-site variants, were also studied.
They are defined by a low (. 50%) antiprotease activity in both the
presence and absence of heparin. The clinical and biological features of
these two cases have been described ( 12, 13).

erly, MA). Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I was from
Boehringer Mannheim GmBH (Mannheim, FRG). Thermus aquaticus polymerase was from Cambio (Cambridge, UK).
Deoxynucleotides. Deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP), deoxycytosine triphosphate (dCTP), deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP),
and deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) were purchased from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals (Uppsala, Sweden).

Experimental protocols
Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a gene assembler (Pharmacia
Fine Chemicals) using the fl-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite method and
purified on polyacrylamide gels. The sequences of all the oligonucleotides are summarized in Table II. The sequences of the allele-specific
oligonucleotide (ASO) probes were designed according to the published mutations of different ATIII variants. When the mutation had
been determined by protein sequencing, the codon presenting a single
nucleotide difference from the wild type sequence was selected. These
probes were 5' end-labeled with [32P] -yATP according to Maxam and
Gilbert (14) with a specific activity of 3-4 ACi pmol-'.
Preparation of DNA samples. Peripheral blood samples from the
eight patients having qualitative ATIII deficiencies and their families
were collected over EDTA. The leucocytes were isolated and their
DNA extracted. This DNA was purified by the method of Bell et al.
(15) with minor modifications: DNA was precipitated with isopropanol, washed three times with 70% ethanol, and dried. It was dissolved over several days at 4°C in 1 mM Tris HCI, 0.1 mM EDTA and
treated with RNase (100
Ig/mI) for 3 h, and dialyzed against the same
buffer for 24 h at 4°C.
Enzymatic amplification of specific genomic DNA sequences. Genomic amplification was performed essentially according to the
method of Saiki et al. (16). The amplification was performed with
either the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I
(first results obtained with dot-blot) or the Taq polymerase Cambio
(for subcloning). Target sequences were amplified in the amplification
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCI [pH 7.6], 10 mM MgCI2, 50 mM NaCI) (100
,gl final volume) containing 1 Ag of genomic DNA, 1.5 mM each of
dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 100 pmol (1 MM) of each extension primer. The extension primers (Table II) were PSIB and PS2B for
exon II, coding for the heparin binding site, and PSI IC and PS12 for
-

exon VI, coding for the reactive site. Samples were heated at 950C for 7
min, microfuged for 10 s, and incubated for 2 min at 550C for Taq
polymerase or 370C for Klenow; 2 U of enzyme (Klenow or Taq) were
then added to each sample and the extension step was carried out at
70°C (Taq) or 50°C (Klenow) for 3 min. A total of 25 cycles were
performed, with addition of either 1 U of Klenow at every cycle, or 2 U
of Taq polymerase at rounds 1 and 12.
Quality control of the amplified material was performed by electrophoresis on 3% agarose gel and Southern blot hybridization (17) with
specific ASO probes (PS3 for amplified exon II and PS9 for amplified
exon VI).
Dot-blot analysis. A 10-Al aliquot of each amplified sample was
denatured with 0.4 N sodium hydroxide and 25 mM EDTA in a final
volume of 200 M,l heated for 2 min at 950C, and cooled on ice. Duplicate 100-Ml aliquots of each sample were placed in the wells of hybridot manifold (Bethesda Research Laboratories, Bethesda, MD) containing a nylon membrane (Biotrace RP, Gelman Sciences, Inc., Ann
Arbor, MI). The samples passed through the filter under vacuum, and
the filter was rinsed quickly in 2X SSPE (I X SSPE = 0.18 M NaCl, 10
mM NaH2PO4, I mM EDTA, pH 7.4) and baked for 2 h at +80°C.
Prehybridization (30 min) and hybridization with the labeled ASO
probe (1 h) were carried out in plastic sealing bags containing 5X SSPE,
5X Denhardt's and 0.5% SDS (solution A), between 42 and 50°C,
depending on the melting temperature of the DNA duplex (Tm) of each
ASO probe.
After hybridization, filters were rinsed twice with 6X SSPE, 0.1%
SDS (solution 1) at room temperature, washed 10 min in 2X SSPE,
0.1% SDS (solution 2) at a temperature determined by the Tm of the
probe, and then exposed to x-ray film for 1-2 h at -80°C with one
intensifying screen (Philips Electronic Instruments, Mahwah, NJ).
Subcloning and sequencing. 50 ,ul of amplified genomic DNA was 5'
end-phosphorylated with I Ml 10 mM ATP using T4 polynucleotide
kinase in 60 Ml (final volume) for I h at 37°C, purified on a Nen-Sorb
20 column (New England Nuclear Research Products, DuPont Co.,
Wilmington, DE), lyophilized, and redissolved in 35 ,l distilled water.
Blunt-end ligation of 5 Ml of the phosphorylated samples with 50 ng of
bacteriophage M 13 mp 18 digested with Sma I was performed for 16 h
at 1 4°C. After transformation, recombinant phages were screened with
two oligonucleotide probes, which were 5' end-labeled with [32P]dATP.
The probes were PS3 and PSI 6 for the heparin binding site, and PS9
and PS13 for the reactive site (Table II).
Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out in solution A
at 42°C for 24 h. The filters were then washed at 50°C for 30 min in
solution 1 and 30 min in solution 2. Single-stranded templates were
prepared from positive recombinant bacteriophages as previously described ( 18).
These single-stranded templates were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method of Sanger (19), as modified for
use with the sequenase kit (United States Biochemicals, Cleveland,
OH) and 35S-dATP.

Results
Exons II and VI ofthe ATIII genes from the seven patients and
one control were amplified and resolved as single bands that
hybridized with their respective specific probes (data not

shown).
Identification of point mutations by dot-blot analysis. The
amplified material was analyzed by dot-blot and hybridization
with a series of ASO probes corresponding to either wild-type
(WT) sequences (WT probes) or to mutated sequences (mutated probes). Fig. 1 shows the results for the HBS variants. All
the samples, except the variant Alger a, hybridized at position
47 with the WT probe (arginine 47). Four samples (Alger a,
Alger b, Paris 1, Paris 2) also hybridized with the mutated
probe (cysteine 47). Thus, the variant Alger a is homozygous
for the mutation (CGT) Arg 47 Cys (TGT) and Alger b is

heterozygous, as previously described (20). The two other variants (Paris 1 and Paris 2) are also heterozygous for the same

mutation.
All the samples gave a positive signal at position 41 with
the WT probe (Pro). Three variants (Clichy, Clichy 2, and
Franconville) also hybridized with the mutated probe (Leu),
indicating that they are heterozygous for the mutation (CCG)
Pro 41 Leu (CTG).
Fig. 2 shows the dot-blot analysis of the amplified reactive
site sequence. The three DNAs tested hybridized with the WT
probe, but that of ATIII Avranches also hybridized with one of
the mutated probes, identifying a point mutation of the cleavage site sequence, His 393-Ser 394 instead of Arg 393-Ser 394.
None of the variants reacted with either the mutant leucine
394 probe or the cysteine 393 probe (data not shown).
The second active site variant (ATIII Charleville) thus was
the only one for which the mutation could not be identified by
dot blot using ASO to previously identified mutants.

identified by dot-blot and to identify new mutations. The amplified region encompassing amino acids 15-78 was sequenced
for the heparin binding site and the region encompassing
amino acids 380-421 for the reactive site.
The point mutation of ATIII Avranches ([CGT] Arg 393
His [CAT]) was directly confirmed by sequencing, as were the
mutation of (CCG) Pro 41 Leu (CTG) (ATIII Clichy 2 and
Franconville) and the mutation (CGT) Arg 47 Cys (TGT)
(ATIII Paris 1 and Paris 2). An example of sequencing of each
mutation (Leu 41, Cys47 and His393) is shown in Fig. 3.
Six single-stranded templates corresponding to the amplified DNA of ATIII Charleville were also sequenced. Two of
them exhibited the same point mutation in position 384, GCA
to CCA, leading to the substitution of alanine 384 for proline

(Fig. 3 b).

amplified material. The use of ASO probes specific for a panel
of mutations already listed in ATIII variants ensured rapid
detection of these mutations in six out of the seven variants.
The homozygous or heterozygous state can also readily be
assessed by this method, which can now be used for routine
examination. Sequencing of all the amplified samples was necessary to confirm the mutations detected by dot-blot and is
especially useful for identifying new mutations, as demonstrated by the ATIII Charleville variant.
Identification of the amino acid substitution responsible
for these seven ATIII variants enabled us to reexamine several
aspects of the structure of the two major functional domains of
the ATIII protein (heparin binding site and serine protease
reactive site) and the pathological impact of each mutation.
The five HBS variants included two Arg 47 Cys mutations
(CGT to TGT) and three Pro 41 Leu mutations (CCG to
CTG). Dot-blot analysis indicated that all the patients were
heterozygous for the gene abnormality. The two heterozygous
patients with Arg 47 Cys mutations had a history of DVT,
whereas the three patients with Pro 41 Leu mutation were

asymptomatic.
Mutations affecting the heparin binding site are usually
associated with a low incidence of DVT. As shown in Table I,
among 52 subjects with an HBS variant, only 5 had previously
had a DVT, and 2 were homozygous. Our two patients with
Arg 47 Cys mutations are heterozygous and both had a severe
thrombotic history. Thus, although there is no definitive proof
of an association between the type of mutation and the thrombotic tendency, this analysis does indicate that DVT is not
present in subjects with heterozygous Pro 41 Leu mutation
and that there is an increased risk of thrombosis with homozygous mutations and Arg 47 Cys mutation. However, the
number of cases studied to date is limited and some heterozygous Arg 47 Cys subjects are asymptomatic (21).
The presence of a free cysteine in the protein could be
responsible for this increase in the thrombotic tendency, as it
may form disulfide bonds with other plasma proteins that
would interfere with binding of ATIII to the glycosaminoglycans of the vascular wall.
The frequency of mutations involving the Pro 41 and Arg
47 among the HBS variants is potentially significant for several

First, these two amino acids are encoded by the
codons CCG and CGT, both of which contain the CG dimer,
which is a major site of methylation in human DNA. CG
dimers might be mutation "hot spots" in the ATIII gene, as
they are in the factor VIII gene (22). On the other hand, Arg 47
and Pro 41 might be critically important for heparin binding to
ATIII. Several proteins can bind heparin through ionic interactions. ATIII is the only one that differentiates between lowand high-affinity heparin. The latter has an irregular sequence
corresponding to a pentasaccharide, which is critical for ATIII
binding. There must be a unique sequence in ATIII corresponding to this pentasaccharide. Perhaps this sequence includes Arg 47 and Pro 41, whose mutations are involved in 7
out of 12 families of HBS variants. However, a comparison of
aminoacid sequences shows that Arg 47 is present in a homologous position in histidine-rich glycoprotein (23) and heparin
cofactor 11 (24), two proteins that bind either low- or high-affinity heparin. ATIII models based on the three-dimensional
structure of a,-antitrypsin indicate that the positively charged
amino acids Arg 47, Lys 125, Arg 129, and Lys 133 are at the
surface of the molecule and may be responsible for heparin
binding through ionic interactions (1, 25). The fragment of
ATIII, obtained by V8 protease digestion, which has the greatest affinity for high-affinity heparin, is 114-156; this fragment
might represent part of the physiological heparin binding
reasons.

domain, whereas fragment 41-49 might be indirectly involved (26).
The case of the reactive-site variants is very different, because the sequence involved in this function is much more
defined and these variants are always associated with a high
incidence of thrombosis, whatever the mutation site (27, 28).
ATIII reactive-site variants are totally unable to inhibit
thrombin. As with other protease inhibitors, ATIII first binds
to the catalytic site of the serine-protease, e.g., the Arg 393-Ser
394 bond of thrombin. Cleavage at this site allows the stoichiometric formation of a covalent inactive complex. This reactive
site of antithrombin III is structurally supported by a loop of
the protein that presents this sequence to the enzyme. Cleavage of ATIII potentially induces a conformational change in
the protein, which switches from a native stressed form (S) to a
more relaxed form (R) (29).
It thus is easy to understand that substitutions at the cleavage site involving PI Arg (393) (30, 32) or P'1 Ser (394) (33)
preclude inactivation of thrombin and other clotting protease,
because the absence of cleavage makes the formation of the
ATIII-thrombin irreversible complex impossible. One of the
variants of our series, ATIII Avranches, was found to bear such
a mutation (393 Arg to His), identical to those found in ATIII
Sheffield (30) and ATIII Glasgow (32, 33). The latter also has a
second biochemical defect: the variant was eluted from a hepa-

rin-Sepharose column with NaCl concentrations higher than
those required for normal ATIII. It was speculated that the P1
residue was indirectly involved in heparin binding and that the
replacement of Arg by His may result in a conformational
change more favorable to heparin binding (31). However, we
could not reproduce these results with the Avranches variant,
which coeluted with normal ATIII from a heparin-Sepharose
column (13). This apparent discrepancy, also observed for
ATIII Sheffield (30), may be due to technical differences and is
presently under further investigation. However, it could also
arise if one of the variants had an additional mutation, because
the proteins have not been completely sequenced.
Antiprotease activity was also abolished by mutations located in the peptide sequences adjacent to the cleavage site.
The Pro 407 Leu and Ala 382 Thr mutations observed in
ATIII Utah and Hamilton (34, 35) are associated with a loss of
antiprotease activity. These two amino acids are extremely
conserved in the serpin family; thus the nature or the location
(respectively in P14 and P12) of the substitution may modify the
presentation or the structure of the loop, so that it can no
longer react with the catalytic site of thrombin (Fig. 4). This
view is supported by the fact that the two variants are not
modified by thrombin and thus are probably not cleaved even
though the cleavage site is intact.
This interpretation makes analysis of the last reactive-site
variant, ATIII Charleville, identified as a Ala 384 Pro mutation, even more interesting. This variant has a unique biochemical behavior and cannot inactivate thrombin, as described previously (13). Briefly, there is an apparent shift in
molecular mass from 58 to 62 kD when ATIII Charleville is

THROMBIN

incubated with thrombin, whereas the migration of the native
protein in SDS polyacrylamide gel remains normal.
These results, together with the fact that this variant corresponds to a new mutation of an amino acid located in the loop
but different from the cleavage site, indicate that ATIII
Charleville belongs to a new class of reactive-site mutant.
The biochemical data suggest that ATIII Charleville binds
to and is cleaved by thrombin, since the in vitro interaction of

the purified variant protein with thrombin increases the appar-

ent molecular weight of the protein, probably by modifying the

conformation of the molecule. Denaturing conditions demolecular weight, probably by releasing the cleaved
fragment. Nevertheless, this ATIII does not form stable covalent ATIII-thrombin complexes, as a consequence of the mutation of the Ala 384 to Pro. It thus is possible to consider
ATIII Charleville, not as an inhibitor of thrombin, but as a
substrate for the enzyme.
It is difficult to understand why this mutation is associated
with such a functional modification. However, by analogy
with the fact that ATIII is a substrate for elastase, which
cleaves the loop of ATIII between PI and Pg, it may be that the
new sequence, Pro-Ser-Thr (instead of Ala-Ser-Thr) competes
with the regular sequence of the loop as a substrate for thrombin, and in this way prevents the variant ATIII being covalently linked to the enzyme. That the sequences of almost all
thrombin substrates have a proline in position P2 (36) favors
this explanation. Sequencing of the NH2 terminus of the
thrombin-modified form of this variant protein could help to
clarify this situation.
In conclusion, ASO probes specific for all the mutations
listed for ATIII variants can be used as a screening test allowing rapid detection of these mutations after enzymatic DNA
amplification. Analysis of a large series of ATIII variants might
lead to the discovery of a correlation between the site of mutation and the thrombotic risk. Sequencing is necessary to identify new mutations that contribute to the characterization of
the reactive sites of ATIII. The new mutation in position 384,
together with the previously reported mutations in position
382 and 407 indicate that additional amino acids are critical
for thrombin inhibition.

Arrow, cleavage site by thrombin. The amino acids 382, 384, and
407 might belong to the reactive site as their substitution impairs the
protease inhibition. The mutations described are Ala 382 Thr for
ATIII Hamilton (35), Ala 384 Pro for ATIII Charleville (this work)
and Pro 407 Leu for ATIII Utah (34).
