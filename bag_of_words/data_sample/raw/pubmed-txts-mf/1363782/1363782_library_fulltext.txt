ABSTRACT
Genetic mapping has indicated that meiotic recombination
occurs about 4 time more frequently in the dystrophin gene
than expected on the basis of its length. To detect where
recombinations occur within the gene, we have studied the
CEPH families panel using highly polymorphic microsatellite
markers located at the ends of the gene or flanking the major
deletion hot spot in intron 44. We found a major hot spot
of recombination between markers STR44 and STR501, i.e.,
between exons 44 and 51. Within this hot spot, a peak of
recombination was located in the large intron 44. A second
minor recombination prone region was found between DXS
206, (XJ, in the large intron 7) and the 5' end of the DMD
gene. The distribution of the recombination events in the gene
of healthy individuals was very similar to that of deletion
breakpoints in DMD/BMD patients, suggesting that the two
phenomenon may share a common mechanism. These results
should also improve efficiency and accuracy of linkage
analysis applied to carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis.
In particular, if markers located at the very 3' end of the
gene are not informative, the highly polymorphic ones located
between exons 50 and 60 can be used instead of presently
available extragenic markers, with a very low risk of
diagnostic error due to recombination.
INTRODUCTION
The most frequent mutations in Duchenne/Becker muscular
dystrophy (DMD/BMD) are deletions and they account for about
70%. of the patients Today, multiplex PCR reactions2"5 detect
almost all deletions in affected males. When no deletion can be
detected in the proband, intragenic and flanking polymorphic
markers are commonly used for prenatal diagnosis and carrier
detection. However, due to the large size of the gene, analysis
of flanking markers is required, to avoid diagnostic errors due
to intragenic meiotic recombination.
In affected families as well as in normal ones, the dystrophin
gene has been shown to recombine with a high frequency6"8.
From these studies it was estimated that intragenic recombination
occurs at a rate of about 10%, 4 times the rate expected on the
basis of the 2.4Mb size of the dystrophin gene. It was proposed
that this high rate may be due to localised 'hot spots'. Chen et
al.6 reported a 3% recombination rate between intragenic loci
DXS 206 (XJ) and DXS 270 (J Bir) (located 600 kb apart), in
a large sample of BMD, DMD families. Abbs et al. 7

hypothesized that the deletion prone P20 region around exons
44—459,10 m a y ajgQ cons titue a recombination hot spot.
During the past years, highly polymorphic microsatellite
markers located within the DMD gene or at its 5' or 3' ends,
have been extensively developed1-4-8- "~ 16 . We took advantage
of these new markers to test the actual existence of recombination
hot spots within the normal dystrophin gene, by systematic
analysis of 39 CEPH families.
RESULTS
A series of 10 microsatellite polymorphisms was used in this study
(table 1). We first tried to find at least one informative marker
at both the 5' end (near muscle or brain promoters) and in the
3' region (past exon 55). On the 5' side, markers near the muscle
promoter had been previously typed by us 8 or by Abbs et al.7.
For those families which were non informative, we tested the
highly polymorphic 5' DYS II microsatellite of Feener et al.",
which is located near the brain promoter. A total of 34 families
were thus informative on the 5' side. For the 3' region, two
microsatellites with relatively low informativeness had previously
been typed 7 ' 8 . In non informative families we now tested the
DMD lc-2 marker (50% heterozygosity) characterized by Powell
et al.13. This microsatellite was selected from a cosmid
containing the Hindin fragments 46 and 47 l3 (detected by cDNA
probes in genomic DNA10), which correspond to a region
between exons 56 and 6017 A total of 24 families were thus
informative for the 3' region, distal to exon 56. Genotypes for
several pERT87 RFLPs were available from the CEPH data base.
For those families which showed recombination between pERT
and the 3' region and for those non informative for the 3' region,
we typed the microsatellite markers between exons 44 and 51
(STR 44, 45, 49 and 50) of Clemens et al. 1 . For some
recombination events, RFLP markers were also typed for more
precise localisation (XJ2.3 at DXS 206 and J Bir at DXS 270).
Twenty four intragenic recombinations were detected (fig 1).
Among them, one was a double recombination in individual 2108.
Each recombination event was checked by retyping and/or by
examination of other intragenic markers. These recombination
events were not randomly located in the gene; there was indeed
a striking clustering, indicating the presence of two recombination
prone regions.
A major hot spot appeared located between introns 44 and 50.
In this 440kb region17, 11 recombinations were detected. (A

further 3 recombinations occurring between pERT87 and intron
45 could not be localised with respect to the intron 44 marker).
These events represent almost half of all recombinants, and are
2.5 times more frequent than expected if the distribution along
the gene was random (p<0.05); they correspond to about 10
fold the usual recombination rate observed elsewhere in the
genome (fig. 2). Within this region, a peak was located between
the markers STR44 and STR45, as it included at least 5
recombinations (and 5 others whose localisation encompasses this
region could not be more precisely mapped). Recombinants did
not display any specific haplotype for markers STR44 and STR45
(not shown).
STR44, which flanks the recombination hot spot on the 5' side,
is located in the very large intron 44 (about 170kb). Intron 44
and the smaller intron 45 are known to encompass the major
deletion hot spot within the dystrophin gene 91018 . Deletion
breakpoints appear largely spread out over intron 44 (although
precise data are lacking for the 5' half of this intron)18. In order
to estimate more precisely the position of STR44 with respect
to the deletion prone region, we checked its presence or absence
in 26 unrelated patients who have a deletion breakpoint in intron
44 (Table 2). 4 patients were deleted for exon 44 and 22 for exon
45. STR44 was present in 17 cases and segregated preferentially
with exon 44 (19 times out of 26). We conclude that more than
75 % of deletion breakpoints within the deletion prone region
(which includes at least part of intron 45) map distal to STR44.
A second recombination prone region was detected between
the 5' end of the gene and the marker XJ. Eight recombinations
occurred between the markers at the 5' end of the gene, and
pERT87 (a 850 kb region17). Three of the 6 families concerned
were informative for the XJ2.3 polymorphic probe. Three
recombinations were localised between muscle exon 1 and exon
8 (a region of 570kb). The other recombinations could not be
localised more precisely, because of lack of informativeness of
the markers. Only one recombinant could be ascribed
unambiguously to the region between pERT87 and J.Bir, and
another one between exon 51 and the 3' untranslated region.

these values do not differ significantly from those expected from published allele frequencies

the markers at each end which were typed also in non
recombinant families. Estimation of recombination was obtained
by a 7 point analysis using the C-ILINK program, a speedy
version of ILINK for CEPH pedigrees (C. Person, personal
communication). We assumed that the 5' markers near the brain
or muscle promoter constitute a single genetic locus, and the same
assumption was made for STR49 and 50, and for DMDlc-2 and
the 3' end markers. This is justified as a first approximation,
as no recombination was detected within these groups of markers.
An overall recombination estimate of 8.7% was obtained between
the 5' and 3' end, with 3% between the 5' end and XJ and 4.5%
between exons 44 and 51 . From these results we also estimated
the ratio of genetic map distance (in cM) to physical distance
(in megabase) which clearly illustrates the presence of the two
recombination prone regions (fig. 2).
From the recombination estimate between the 5' and 3' ends,
one could expect about 13 families with one recombination, 5
families with 2, and 2 families with 3. The distribution observed
does not depart from these probabilities (12 families had 1
recombinant, 3 had 2, and 2 had 3), and there is thus no indication
that some families may be more prone to recombination than
others.
DISCUSSION
We have analyzed recombination throughout the dystrophin gene
using a series of microsatellite markers typed in 39 normal
(CEPH) families. Our overall estimation of recombination
between the 5' and 3' end of the gene is about 9%, which is
slightly less than the 11 % we had obtained previously on a smaller
number of informative families8. A total of 24 intragenic
recombination events were mapped.
We have obtained evidence for two hot spots of recombination
in the DMD gene: a major one between STR44, in the proximal
part of intron 44, and STR50 (intron 50), and a minor one
between the muscle dystrophin promoter and exon 8. In the
former region, the average recombination rate is llcM per
megabase, while in the latter it is about 4.5cM per megabase,
while lcM per megabase is the average over the whole genome.
Our multipoint estimate of the recombination rate between
DXS206 and intron 44 is 0.6 cM, which is less than the 2.9cM
± lcM estimate of Chen et al6 for the interval DXS206DXS270 (the latter is in intron 43), based mostly on the analysis
of DMD/BMD families. This apparent discrepancy may be due
to the uncertainty affecting these estimates, as the number of

As STR45, 49 and 50 have been typed preferentially in recombinant families,
the corresponding estimates of recombination fraction are biased towards higher
values; confidence limits are given for values derived from unbiased typing. 3'

recombination events recorded is small. In our sample a single
recombinant could be precisely mapped between DXS206 and
STR44, but 7 other events could only be mapped to a broader
region which encompasses the DXS206—DXS270 interval. Only
one intragenic recombination was found distal to exon 51 (in about
200 meioses informative for the 3' region).
When the distribution of the recombination events in the CEPH
panel families was superimposed with the histograms of the
deletion breakpoints in the BMD and DMD patients reported by
Koenig et al.9 as well as by Den Dunnen et al.10, there was an
obvious correlation between the location of the hot spots for
recombinations and the hot spots for deletions (e.g., see fig. 2

in Den Dunnen et al.10). Moreover, the peaks for recombinations and deletions rose to the same magnitude: about half
of the recombination events we report, were located between
introns 44 and 50, whereas about 53% of all deletions observed
in the study of Koenig et al. 9 took place in the same region. In
particular at least 5 of the 11 recombinations mapped between
intron 44 and 50 were located between introns 44 and 45, which
corresponds to the peak of deletion breakpoint density(910).
Similarly, at least one sixth of the recombinations were located
between exons 1 and 8, compared to 18% of the deletions.
The similar localisation of hot spots of meiotic recombination
and hot spots of deletions suggest mat they may share a common
mechanism of genome instability. However, mitotic exchange
between sister chromatids may be at least as important as meiotic
recombination in generating deletions or duplications in the
dystrophin gene, as shown by the approximately equal frequency
of paternal or maternal origin of such mutations19. Furthermore
as pointed out by Love et al.20, the higher frequency of deletions
versus duplications indicate that the major deletion mechanism
may not be a simple unequal crossing over.
Homologous recombination between repetitive sequences was
found frequently involved in generating deletions in some genes,
such as the steroid sulfatase gene21, the complement Cl-inhibitor
gene implicated in hereditary angiodema22, the low-densitylipoprotein-receptor gene23 or the a-globin locus24. However,
the fine mapping of 113 breakpoints of deletions within intron
44 did not reveal local clustering expected if such mutations were
linked to the presence of a specific sequence18. The sequence
of two junction fragments of deletions within the hot spot did
not reveal an involvement of a repetitive sequence20.
The sequences which may favor meiotic recombinations in
mammals are not known. A recombination hot spot within the
mouse MHC was precisely mapped within a 800bp fragment
containing a tetranucleotide repeat sequence. However, the strong
linkage desequilibrium associated to several microsatellites8'25
does not favour a general enhancement effect of such sequences
on meiotic recombination. On the other hand, minisatellites have
been found clustered in telomeric regions that show high
recombination frequency26"30. The mapping of recombination
events within the dystrophin gene is not precise enough to allow
differentiation between the involvement of specific sequences,
or rather the existence of a particular higher order chromatin
conformation favoring deletions and other recombination events,
as suggested by Blonden et al. 18 .
Our results have important implications for the application of
linkage analysis for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis in
those DMD/BMD families where direct detection of deletions
or duplications is not possible. The 10% intragenic recombination
rate renders mandatory the use of flanking markers. On the 5'
side the microsatellites described near the brain or muscle
promoters 8> " should provide information in almost all cases.
The situation was much less favorable at the 3' end since the
two microsatellites described within the 3'UTR 81214 are not
very informative, especially as they are in strong linkage
desequilibrium12. Available extragenic markers mapped in the
3' telomeric side such as RFLPs at DXS28 or DXS41 are
moderately informative, but their major drawback in their location
within 5 to IOCM of the DMD gene. The mapping of
recombination events within the dystrophin gene indicates that
the microsatellite described by Powell et al.13 in the exons
5 6 - 6 0 region, and even the highly informative STR50 repeat1,
can be used when those in the 3' untranslated region are not

informative. We have estimated the intragenic recombination
distal to STR50 at .6 cM. Even if a more conservative figure
of lcM is used, given that about 70% of the coding sequence
mutation target (point mutations) is located upstream STR50, the
probability of having at the same time a distal recombination and
an even more distal mutation causing a diagnostic error would
be out of the order of 0.13%, and this would concern only about
10% of the DMD families (i.e. where no deletion is detected
and where no marker distal to STR50 is informative), an overall
risk which would be equivalent to that of new mutations in the
DMD gene.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The CEPH panel of 40 large families was screened for twelve DMD intragenic
markers (one of the pedigrees was omitted from further analysis because of
inconsistent results). Microsatellite markers reported in table 1 were typed as
described in the relevant references, using (in general) one end 32P labeled
primer, or (in some cases) ethidium bromide staining.
We used the CEPH data base which provided the typing results for the markers
84 1Q16, the pERT 87 probes at DXS 164 (pert87-l, 87-8, 87-15, 87-30)31 and
MP1P i".
The linkage analysis was performed using the C-ILINK computer program (C.
Person, personal communication).
