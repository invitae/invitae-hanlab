Vector Cloning Systems.
Clinical Data-Five subjects (FH 264,550,786,793, and 787) have
the classical clinical syndrome of dominantly inherited homozygous
FH. FH 264 (female), FH 550 (female), and FH 786 (male) are from
three different Lebanese families. FH 793 (female) is Syrian. Cells
from all four of these subjects produce a 100-kDa LDL receptor
precursor that is not processed. FH 787 (male) is a French Canadian
who is a compound heterozygote; his cells produce both a 120-kDa
unprocessed form of the LDL receptor and a 160-kDaprocessed form.
FH 265 (male) is a Lebanese with a variant form of familial
hypercholesterolemia. He is one of four affected siblings in the Kh
family described by Khachadurian (19) and Khachadurian and Uthman (20). The variant form of hypercholesterolemia is distinguished
from classic FH in the following three ways: 1) autosomal recessive
inheritance (the heterozygous parents in the Kh family have normal
total plasma cholesterol levels); 2) lower total plasma cholesterol
levels in affected homozygotes (the four affected siblings in the Kh
family have values of 414-470 mg/dl versus 600-1000 mg/dl in classic
FH homozygotes); and 3) a lower population frequency (of 30families
with severe hypercholesterolemia in Lebanon, only 1 had the variant
form and theother 29 had classic FH) (19,20).
Assays of LDL Metabolism and Monoclonal IgG-C7Binding-Human fibroblasts were obtained from skin biopsy specimens and grown
in monolayer culture a t 37 "C in a 5% CO, incubator. About 3.5 X
lo' cells from stock cultures were seeded into 60-mm Petri dishes
according to a standard protocol and cultured for 5 days. Maximal
synthesis of LDL receptors was induced by incubation in human
lipoprotein-deficient serum for 48 h prior to study, as described
elsewhere (16). We then measured the binding, internalization, and
degradation of '=I-LDL a t 37 'C (16) and thecell surface binding of
monoclonal anti-receptor 1261-IgG-C7a t 4 'C (18).

LDL Receptors-Monolayers of fibroblasts were incubated with [36S]methionine
in methionine-free Dulbecco'smodified Eagle's medium supplementedwith 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum as indicated in the
figure legends. After labeling, the cells were washed twice with 2 ml
of ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (GIBCO 310-4190)
and then lysed by addition of0.2 ml of buffer containing 10 mM
HEPES (pH 7.4), 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl,, 2.5 mMMgC12, 1 mM
unlabeled methionine, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM
leupeptin, and 1.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. The dishes were scraped
with a rubber policeman, and thecell extract was centrifuged at 4 "C
for 30 min a t 150,000 X g. The supernatant was precipitated with
preformed immune complexes consisting of monoclonal mouse antiLDL receptor IgG-C7 or IgG-2001 and goat anti-mouse IgG as described previously (21). If not indicated otherwise, the immunoprecipitates were dissolved by heating a t 90 "C for 3 min in buffer

repeated seven times and is believed to constitute the LDLbinding domain. Exons 7-14 encode a sequence of 400 amino
acids of unknown function that is homologous to a sequence
in theprecursor for epidermal growth factor. Exon 15 encodes
a sequence of 58 amino acids that contains 18 serine and
threonine residues, to most of which are attached short carbohydrate chains in 0-linkage (13, 14). This is the so-called
clustered 0-linked sugar region (15). Exon 16 and part of
exon 17 encode a hydrophobic sequence that spans themembrane. The remainder of exon 17 and exon 18encode a COOHterminal sequence of 50 amino acids that projects into the
cytoplasm and directs the receptor to coated pits.
The calculated molecular weight of the protein component
of the LDL receptor (minus the signal sequence) is 93,102.
When the receptor is synthesized, it migrates on sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels with an anomalous
molecular weight of 120,000, a property that is partly attributable to the presence of N-acetylgalactosamine residues on
the clustered serine and threonine residues encoded by exon
15 (14, 15). After the newly synthesized receptor is transported to the Golgi complex, its apparent molecular weight
shows afurther anomalous increase to 160,000, primarily
owing to theelongation of the clustered 0-linked sugar chains
by the addition of galactose and sialic acid residues (14). In
addition to the clustered 0-linked sugars, the receptor contains a few 0-linked sugar chains as well as two to three N linked carbohydrate chains scattered on the NH2-terminal
portion of the protein (15).These latterforms of carbohydrate
contribute relatively little to the anomalous electrophoretic
behavior of the receptor. When the clustered 0-linked sugar
region encoded by exon 15 is artificially deleted from the
cDNA, the transfected receptor loses most of its anomalous
behavior on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (15).
In the current study, we report the molecular basis of a
prevalent mutation that causes FH in the Lebanese population. This "Lebanese allele" produces a receptor that migrates
with an abnormally smallapparent molecular weight of
100,000. The defect is attributableto a single base substitution
in exon 14 that produces a premature termination codon. The
truncated receptor lacks the region encoded by exon 15 and
therefore lacks clustered 0-linked sugars. The receptor also
lacks a membrane-spanning region and a cytoplasmic tail.
Evidence for a similar defect was found in four individuals,
three from different families in Lebanon and one from Syria.
We believe that thisnonsense mutation accountsfor the high
frequency of FH in Lebanon.

Mutant LDL Receptor Retained in Endoplasmic Reticulum
(16 h, 14 "C) with 490 units of T 4 DNA ligase. The ligated material
was packaged into X phage particles in vitro to yield a total of 1.9 X
lo6 plaque-forming units, and one recombinant clone was identified
with an exon Wspecific probe. This clone, designated XFH 264-22,
was isolated after two additional cycles of plaque purification. The
human DNA insert was subcloned into BamHl-digested pBR322. A
restriction map of the insert was in agreement with that of the
corresponding segment of the normal gene (5).
DNA Sequencing-The sequence of exon 14 in XFH 264-22 was
obtained as follows. An oligonucleotide primer specific for the 5' end
was 5' end-laof exon 14 (5'-GAGTGAACTGGTGTGAGAGG-3')
beled with [Y-~'P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. A doublestranded plasmid derived from pBR322 and containing the cloned
insert of XFH 264-22 was denatured with 0.4 N sodium hydroxide and
then annealed with the 32P-labeled primer. The primer-template
complex was subjected to one of two procedures: 1) it was extended
in the presence of appropriate dideoxynucleotide mixtures (without
c~-~'P-labeled
deoxynucleotides) and the Klenow fragment of E. coli
DNA polymerase I and sequenced by a modification of the method of
Sanger et al. (26); or 2) i t was extended in the presence of 1 mM
deoxynucleotides and the Klenow fragment, digested with Sphl, and
subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to yield a
119-nucleotide extension product, which was sequenced by the
method of Maxam and Gilbert (27). The sequence of the normal exon
14 (4, 5) was generated for direct comparison with the sequence of
exon 14 from FH 264 by the above methods using plasmid p381-20
(28), which contained a 17-kb BamHI fragment of the normal gene
extending from intron 10 to exon 18.
Southern Blotting-High molecular weight genomic DNA (5 pg)
was isolated from cultured fibroblasts (6), digested with a 12-fold
excess of HinfI, and subjected to electrophoresis for 14 h at 1.2 V
cm" in 5% NuSieve-agarose (FMC Corp.) with buffer containing 45
mM Tris acetate, 2 mM trisodium EDTA, 10 mM sodium acetate, and
9 mM NaCl at pH8.2. The gel was then treated by shaking a t room
temperature with 0.5 M NaOH and 1.5 M NaCl for 60 min, followed
by 5 X buffer A (1 X buffer A = 50 mM Tris acetate and 1 mM
trisodium EDTA at pH8.2) for 40 min, followed by 1 X buffer A for
30 min. The DNA was transferred by capillary blotting (23) for 48 h
with 1 X buffer A to Zeta-probe membranes (Bio-Rad). After rinsing
for 1 min with 1 X buffer A, the filter was prehybridized, hybridized
with 2.5 X lo6 cpm of a single-stranded probe/ml, and washed as
previously described (6). Filters were then exposed with Kodak XAR5 x-ray film a t -70°C with intensifying screens.

(day 7 of cell growth), each monolayer received 2 ml of medium

total values for surface-bound, intracellular, and degraded 'T-LDL
were determined. The datawere not corrected for nonspecific binding,

RESULTS

Fig. 1 compares the binding, uptake, and degradation of
lZ5I-LDLat 37 "C in cells from a normal subject and from
subject FH 264, the prototype individual with the 100-kDa
form of the LDL receptor that is produced by the Lebanese
allele. The FH 264 cells showed no detectable high affinity
binding, uptake, or degradation of lz5I-LDL. Table I shows
that cells from three other individuals from different Arab
families (FH 550 and 786 from Lebanon and FH 793 from
Syria) also show a marked reduction in high affinity binding,
uptake, and degradationof lz5I-LDL.Intact cells from FH 264
and FH 550 also failed to bind '251-labeledIgG-C7 at 4 "C, a
monoclonal antibody directed against the LDL receptor, indicating that no immunoreactive receptor reached the surface
of these cells (Table 11).
As shown in Fig. 2, after a 2-h incubation with [35S]methionine and precipitation with IgG-C7, normal fibroblasts exhibited two forms of the LDL receptor on SDS-polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis: 1)the precursor form with an apparent
molecular weight of 120,000, and 2) the mature form with an
apparent molecular weight of 160,000 (Fig.2, Lane A ) . When
the cells were chased with unlabeled methionine for 2 h, all
of the precursor was converted to the mature form (Fig. 2,
Lane B ) . In contrast, the FH 264 cells produced only a 100kDa precursor (Fig. 2, Lane C), which was not converted to a
higher molecular weight even after a 2-h chase
with unlabeled
methionine (Fig. 2, Lane D).The amount of labeled receptor
in the FH 264 cells was much less than that in the normal

cells, neuraminidase decreased the apparent molecular mass
of the 160-kDa mature receptor (Fig. 5, Lane 2), but it did
not affect the 120-kDaprecursor. In contrast, endo H did not
30
affect the mature form of the receptor, but it did reduce the
apparent molecular mass of the 120-kDa precursor ( L a n e 4).
In the FH264 cells, neuraminidase had no effect on the 100kDa form of the receptor ( L a n e 7), but endo H reduced its
apparent molecular mass ( L a n e 9). Thus, 2 h after its synthesis, the 100-kDa protein appeared to possess unprocessed
high-mannose, endo H-sensitive N-linked sugars, but not
mature sialylated oligosaccharides.
To determine whether the 100-kDa receptor in the Lebanese homozygote cells contains clustered 0-linked N-acetylgalactosamine residues, we incubated normal and FH 264

N-linked oligosaccharides adhere tothe concanavalin ASepharose column, but the 0-linked sugars do not. Since there
is much more N-acetylgalactosamine (0-linked) than N-acetylglucosamine (N-linked) in the LDL receptor precursor, the
bulk of the radioactivity does not adhere to theconcanavalin
A column (Fig. 6C and Ref. 14). A strikingly different distribution of radioactivity was observed in the FH 264 cells. In
these cells, mostof the radioactivity adhered to the concanavalin A column and was eluted only with a-methylmannoside
(Fig. 6A, solid circles). Verylittle LDL receptor-specificradioactivity appeared in the run-through fractions, indicating that
little N-a~etyl[~H]galactosamine
was incorporated into 0linked sugars (Fig. 6A).
To control for nonspecific immunoprecipitation in the FH
264 cells, we performed the same digestion and column chromatography on a corresponding fragment of a polyacrylamide
gel to which we had applied a labeled extract that was im-

munoprecipitated with an irrelevant monoclonal antibody
(Fig. 6A, open circles). Fig. 6B shows the difference between
the radioactivity obtained from the specific and nonspecific
immunoprecipitates in each of the column fractions. Even
after this correction was made, a small amount of specifically
precipitated radioactivity from the FH264 cells was found in
the void volume fractions in Fig. 6B. We believe that this
radioactivity represents the small number of scattered 0linked carbohydrate chains that are known to be attached to
the LDL receptor in regions outside of the cluster encoded by
exon 15 (Ref. 15). Thus, the dataof Fig. 6 are consistentwith
the hypothesis that the FH264 receptor lacked all clustered
0-linked carbohydrates.
To determine whether the shortened LDL receptor of FH
264 cells contains a normal COOH terminus, we incubated
cells for 4 h with [35S]methionineand then precipitated the
receptors with either of two antibodies, one directed against
the NH2-terminalregion of the receptor and the other
directed
against the COOH-terminal14 amino acids (Fig. 7). In normal
cells, the receptor was precipitated with the anti-NH2-terminal antibody (Lane A) and the antibody directed against the
COOH-terminal sequence (Lane B). The receptor produced
in FH 264 cells was precipitated by the anti-NH2-terminal
antibody (Lane C), but it was not precipitated by the antiCOOH-terminal antibody (Lane D).
The reduced size, lack of clustered 0-linked sugars, and
absence of reactivity with the anti-COOH-terminal antibody
suggested that the FH264 receptor might terminate prior to
the region encoded by exon 15. To determine whether this
termination resulted from a gross deletion in the FH
264 gene,
we studied the size of the mRNA encoded by this allele. As
shown in Fig. 8, the size of the LDL receptor mRNA produced
by the FH 264 cells was indistinguishable from normal after
denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Moreover, extensive
analysis of the FH 264 receptor gene by Southern blotting
with cDNA probes specific for exons 1-18 of the receptor
indicated an absence of any large deletions or rearrangements
(data not shown). These findings raised the possibility that
the shortened receptor protein in the FH 264 cells was the

the LDL receptor gene.
To test this hypothesis, we turned to genomiccloning.
Exons 11-17 (and part of exon 18) of the LDL receptor are
contained on a 17-kb BarnHI fragment (Fig. 9). We digested
genomic DNA from patient FH 264 with BarnHI, size-fractionated the fragments to isolate those with a size in the range
of 17 kb, and ligated these DNAs into a bacteriophage X
cloning vector. A recombinant bacteriophage containing the
receptor fragment was isolated, and the DNA insert was
subcloned into pBR322 and subjected to sequencing by primer
extension on denatured double-stranded DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). The sequence of the extended primer
was determined by the chemical method of Maxam and Gilbert (27) and by the dideoxy chain termination method of
Sanger et al. (26). Both methods gave the same result: the FH
264 gene contained a cytidine to adenine transversion in

blots were probed with a 32P-labeledcDNA fragment corresponding to exon 14. DNA from five normal subjects (two of
whom are shown in Fig. 1lA)showed a HinfI band of -286
base pairs. In thethree Lebanese patients and theone Syrian
patient described above (FH 264,550,786, and 793), a smaller
HinfI fragment of -210 base pairs was seen (Fig. 1lA). This
is the predicted size of the fragment if the abnormal HinfI
site were present in thegene (Fig. 11B). Moreover,
the absence
of the normal 286-base pair fragment indicates that all four
individuals are true homozygotes. DNA from the Lebanese
patient (FH 265) with the variant form of hypercholesterolemia (see “Experimental Procedures”) showed onlythe normal
Hinff band (Fig. 1lA). This result is consistent with the
biochemical phenotype of these cells, which shows a mature
receptor that migrates with an apparent molecular weight of
160,000on SDS gels (data not shown).
The premature termination codon in the FH264 cells would
beexpected to produce a receptor that terminates in the
middle of a 40-amino acid cysteine-rich sequence designated
repeat C (Fig. 12). Such an alteration is likely to disrupt the
disulfide-bondingpattern of the receptor in this region. Previous studies have suggested that the vast majority of the
cysteine residues in the LDL receptor are disulfide-bonded
(29). To demonstrate this phenomenon formally, we purified
the LDL receptor from bovine adrenal cortex using a previously described procedure (30). The receptor was denatured
in 7 M guanidine and then incubated in an excess of [3H]
iodoacetic acid with or without prior reduction with P-mercaptoethanol (Table 111). Following the reaction, the receptor
was dialyzed and theamount of incorporated 3H radioactivity
was measured. In the absence of P-mercaptoethanol, very
little [3H]iodoacetic acid was
incorporated (approximately0.2
mol/mol of receptor). In the presence of P-mercaptoethanol,
85 mol of [3H]iodoaceticacid was incorporated per molof
receptor. If the amino acidsequence of the bovineLDL
receptor is the same as that of the human (4) or the rabbit
(9), we would have expected 62-63 mol of [3H]iodoacetic acid
incorporated per molof fully reduced receptor. The value
observed in Table I11 (85 mol/mol) is close to the expected
value if one allows for the experimental error of the protein
determination used to estimate the amount of pure receptor.
The dataindicate that very few, ifany, of the cysteine residues
of the LDL receptor are accessible to [3H]iodoaceticacid in
the absence of prior reduction, presumably because they are
disulfide-bonded. If free cysteine residues do exist, they are
presumably buried within the receptor structure where they
are inaccessible to [3H]iodoacetic acid, even in the presence
of a strong denaturant.
DISCUSSION

In this paper, we describe a nonsense mutation at codon
660 in the LDL receptor gene. The mutation was found in
three Lebanese subjects and one Syrian subject, all from
different families. Each of the individuals had the classic
syndrome of homozygous FH, andeach appeared to have two
copies of the same mutant gene. As shown in Fig. 12, the
nonsense mutation would be expected to give rise to a protein
of 659 amino acids that lacks the region containing clustered
0-linked carbohydrates, the membrane-spanning region, and
the cytoplasmic tail. Biochemical studies confirmed that the
receptor produced by the mutant cells is smaller than normal

that the FH264 cells contain approximately normal amounts
of mutant receptor mRNA, this ie a qualitative experiment
based on poly(A)+ RNA; and thus, the results must be interpreted with caution. It is conceivable that the premature
termination codon maylead to a reduced cytoplasmic concentration of the mutant mRNA as hasbeen shown for a similar
type of mutation in a @-thalassemiagene (31). Alternatively,
the stop codon could affect the translational efficiency of the
mutant RNA, perhaps owing to a kinetic delay in releasing
the truncated nascent chain from the ribosome or in translocating the mutant polypeptide chain across the endoplasmic
reticulum membrane. The magnitude of the reduced expression seems too great to be attributed to rapid degradation of
the mutant protein. As shown in Fig. 2, at least half of the

from the cell. Indeed, we performed multiple experiments in
which the FH 264 cells and the FH 550 cells were labeled
with [36S]methionine for periods ranging up to 24 h, after
which the culture medium was subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies known to precipitate the FH 264 and
FH 550 receptors. No immunoprecipitable receptor was observed in the culture medium. These experiments were performed under conditions in which we have previously demonstrated secretion of LDL receptors in a cell line that expresses an LDL receptor gene that lacks the exons encoding
the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (6). Instead of
being secreted, the FH 264 receptor seemed to undergo degradation with ahalf-life of about 2 h (data not shown).
We do not know why the FH264 receptor was retained in
the endoplasmic reticulum for a prolonged period, but a clue
may lie in the site of the premature termination (Fig. 12).
The termination codon occurs in themidst of a 40-amino acid
cysteine-rich sequence that has been designated as repeat C.
This sequence is at the COOH-terminal end of a 400-amino
acid sequence that is held in common by the LDL receptor
and the epidermal growth factor precursor (32). Within this
400-residue sequence, the 40-amino acid cysteine-rich sequence is repeated three times (32). The first two repeats (A
and B)occur at theNH2-terminal endof the 400-amino acid
sequence, and the finalrepeat ( C ) occurs at the COOHterminal end. Eachof the repeats is encoded by a single exon;
the C repeat is encoded by exon 14. Each of the repeats
contains 6 cysteine residues. Biochemical evidence suggests
that these cysteine residues are all involved in intrachain
disulfide bonds (Table 111); and it is likely that all of the
bonds form within repeats rather than between repeats, a
finding that has been documented for other proteins with
similar cysteine-richsequences, e.g. the blood-clotting factors
(33). The abnormal termination codon occurs at theposition
of the third cysteine of the C repeat (Fig. 12). It seems likely
that the 2 remaining cysteine residues would no longer be
able to engage in normaldisulfide bond formation. This would
leave unpaired cysteine residues near the COOH terminus,
which might lie at the surface of the protein. The existence
of such exposed free sulfhydryls might be sufficient to block
the movement of the receptor out of the endoplasmic reticulum.
We have previously observed two other mutations in which
the LDL receptor fails to move to theGolgi complex(9). Both
of these involve small in-frame deletions in another
cysteinerich region, i.e. the NH2-terminal 292 amino acids that constitute theligand-binding domain. These mutations were also
postulated to distort the normal pattern of disulfide bond
formation, therebyleading to theexistence of unpaired sulfhydryls.
It is possible that unpaired sulfhydryls in some way interfere with the movement of proteins from the endoplasmic
reticulum tothe Golgicomplex. Such hindrance maybe
mediated by gatekeeper proteins that bind these sulfhydryls
and stop themovement of abnormal proteins to the surface.
As originally suggested by Gething et al. (34), the purpose of
such a system might be to prevent the immune system from
being exposed to denatured proteins that might trigger abnormal immune responses. Further studies are now planned
to testwhether the presence of unpaired cysteine residues in
the truncated C repeat is responsible for the failure of the
LDL receptor in the FH 264 cells to leave the endoplasmic
reticulum a t a normal rate.
From the data currently available, it would seem that the
nonsense mutation at codon 660 is responsible for the high
incidence of FH in Lebanon. This mutation accounts for all

eight alleles at the LDL receptor locus in the four unrelated
homozygotes with classic FH from Lebanon and Syria that
we have studied. Presumably, the high frequency of this
mutation is attributableto a founder effect. In addition to the
classic form of familial hypercholesterolemia in Lebanon,
there is also a rare variant form (19, 20). In DNA from one
such rare variant,we found a normal HinfI digestion pattern.
Thus, these rare variantsmust have a different mutation.
The ability to distinguish the Lebanese allele on the basis
of a HinfI digest of genomic DNAshould allow us to determine
whether all cases of classic FH in Lebanon and neighboring
Arab countries stem from the same mutation. If this is the
case, then it should be possible to develop a rapid method of
diagnosis employing Southern blotting.
