Abstract
Patients with the Denys-Drash syndrome (Wilms' tumor, genital
anomalies, and nephropathy) have been demonstrated to carry de now
constitutional

mutations

We suggest that parents of individuals with the DDS be evalu
ated for the presence of the WTJ mutation.
Materials and Methods

in WTJ, the Wilms' tumor gene at chromosome

I 1p13. We report three new cases, two carrying a previously described

WTI exon 9 mutation and one with a novel WTJ exon 8 mutation.
However, unlike patients in previous reports, one of our three patients
inherited the affected allele from his phenotypically unaffected father.
This observation indicates that the WTI exon 9 mutation affecting
394Argdemonstrated in over one-half of the patients with the Denys
Drash syndrome may exhibit incomplete penetrance. Consequently, fa
milial studies in patients affected by this syndrome are recommended.

Patients. The clinical and cytogenetic features of three patients with
DDS are summarized in Table 1. D7, the father of patient D5, is at
present a healthy 42-year-old male. Physical examination did not reveal
any abnormalities; in particular he has bilaterally descended testes of

seemed to confirm this hypothesis (10). We report here the
presence of the same 14'Ti exon 9 mutation in a phenotypically
abnormal male and his phenotypically unaffected father. This
finding demonstrates that U'Tl mutations causing the DDS can
indeed be inherited and need not be expressed phenotypically.

(Fig. 1) a mobility shift in exon 9 (encoding zinc finger 3) of one
allele from patients Dl and D5, and in exon 8 (encoding zinc
finger 2) of one allele from patient DIO. Constitutional DNA
from the parents of Dl (D2 and D3) and D10 (D8 and D9)
demonstrated a normal (homozygous) SSCP pattern (Fig. 1). A
homozygous SSCP pattern was also found for the mother (D6),
three paternal aunts (51D7, S2D7, S3D7), and brother (BD5)
of D5, but the father (D7) of D5 showed a heterozygous SSCP
pattern similar to the one demonstrated for his son (Fig. 1). The
heterozygous SSCP pattern found in the father was confirmed
on a second blood sample taken 3 months after the first one. In
addition, very numerous tandem repeat studies were performed
on samples from D5, D6, and D7 and were found to be consis
tent with the presumed paternity (data not shown). DNA of a
(the only) paternal uncle of D5 could not be obtained.
Sequence analysis of constitutional DNA revealed a I I29@to
T transition converting amino acid residue 377His to Tyr in
patient DlO (Fig. 2A), and a â€˜

amino acid residue 394Arg to Trp in patients Dl and D5
(Fig. 2B). Sequence analysis ofD7 revealed the same â€˜

We report three patients with the DDS who were found to
have constitutional JYFJ mutations which alter the amino acid

WTJ

exon 9 mutation in a phenotypically normal father of a child
with this syndrome, raises the question of the origin of the
mutations. A recessive mode of inheritance, resulting from the
inheritance

Discussion

Dl and D5 affect amino acid res

idue 394Arg, which has been implicated in hydrogen bonding
interactions with a guanidine residue in the cognate DNA
recognition sequence (15). This mutation has now been re
ported in 14 of 25 (@55%) individuals with the DDS. The WTJ
exon 8 mutation found in patient D1O affects amino acid resi
due 377His and disrupts one of the four zinc binding ligands of
zinc finger 2; this mutation has not been described previously.
In addition to these two @Vf1missense mutations, an exon 9
missense mutation affecting 396Asp has been reported previ
ously in three patients, an exon 8 missense mutation affecting
366Mg in two patient, an exon 7 missense mutation affecting
330Cys in one patient, an insertion ofG at position 821 in exon
6 resulting in the immediate generation of a stop codon in one
patient, and finally, an intron 9 mutation, which prevents splic
ing at one of the alternative splice donor sites of exon 9, in
another patient (8â€”10).The JVI'l zinc finger region, encoded by
exons 7â€”10,and especially exon 9, seems to be a â€œhot
spotâ€•for
constitutional mutations causing the DDS.
The identification of constitutional WTJ zinc finger muta

seems

unlikely given the fact that in the 23 patients reported with a
constitutional WTJ mutation, only one abnormal allele has
been observed in each patient (8â€”10).Although false negative
results have been reported for SSCP analysis, it is considered a

very sensitive assay (8). It seems unlikely that the SSCP assay

@

would have failed to reveal a second mutation in all 23 patients
analyzed. The data are more consistent with an autosomal
dominant mode of inheritance for this disorder. Because all
cases reported to date have occurred sporadically, the WTJ
allelic penetrance has been assumed to be very high (8), leading
to the suggestion that it would be extremely unlikely for a
parent of a child with the DDS to carry a nonpenetrant muta
tion (8). This hypothesis has been supported by the analysis of

The presence of the WTJ exon 9 missense germline mutation
in an unaffected parent suggests either that W7'I mutations
exhibit incomplete penetrance [in contrast to what was previ

gests that J@Vf1is not subject to transcriptional imprinting (18).
We therefore believe that another cause of incomplete pene
trance is the more likely explanation for our findings. Unfor
tunately, we have been unable to assess the possibility of so
matic mosaicism in this individual; sperm analysis is not
feasible because D7 has had a vasectomy performed and has
thus far not consented to providing us with a skin biopsy for
fibroblast culture and analysis.
This report demonstrates that JJ'Tl mutations in patients
with DDS may be inherited from a phenotypically normal par
ent, the carrier of the mutation. Accordingly, familial studies of
affected patients are indicated. It is expected that such studies
will improve the genetic counseling provided to individuals af
fected by this syndrome and their families and enhance our
understanding ofthe role of @VF1
in genitourinary development
and Wilms' tumorigenesis.
