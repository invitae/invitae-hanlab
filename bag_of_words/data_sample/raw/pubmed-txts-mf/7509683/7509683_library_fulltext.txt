INTRODUCTION
Since the characterisation of the gene encoding
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein and the identification of its
main mutation AF508 (Kerem e t al., 1992) in the
Caucasian population, more than 170 mutations
have been reported (Collins, 1992). Most of these
mutations are rare, only a few reaching frequencies
of more than 1% in some populations. Screening
DNA samples from CF patients in Bavaria (southeast Germany) by heteroduplex and SSCP analysis
of exon 10, we have identified three novel mutations, IS06S, S466X, and 1651A+T, in the
CFTR gene. The clinical data available so far do
not suggest an atypical course of the disease in the
patients carrying these mutations.

METHODS
Screening for the mutation AF508 was performed by PCR amplification of exon 10 (Zielenski
et al., 1991) and resolution of PCR products o n
acrylamide gels in a sample of 227 CF patients from
Bavaria (southern Germany). The interpretation
was based o n product length differences for homozygotes and additional heteroduplex formation
in heterozygotes. Allele-specific PCR (Ballabio et
al., 1990) was performed in parallel. After additional screening by previously described methods
for the mutations GS42X (Kerem et al., 1990),
G551D, and R553X (Cutting et al. 1990), SSCP
analysis was performed in a modification of the
method of Orita (Orita et al., 1989) o n nondena0 1994 WILEY-LISS, INC.

turing gels with visualisation by silver staining. Sequence analysis was performed by amplification of
exon 10 (Zielenski e t al., 1991), purification of the
product by spin-column ultrafiltration (Centricon)
prior to reamplification, and direct double-strand
sequencing by the dideoxy method (Pharmacia).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Mutation 1506s
Aberrant heteroduplex formation in a patient
who carries AF508 o n one chromosome led to the
detection of this new mutation (Fig. 1, lane 5).
Sequence analysis then revealed a novel mutation
present o n one chromosome of the patient and the
mother. The T to G transition at nucleotide position 1649 results in a serine for isoleucine substitution at amino acid position 506 (1506s) (Fig.
2a). SSCP screening did not show 1506s in 150
non-CF chromosomes. Among the 227 patients
investigated it was present in a total of four patients from two unrelated families. T h e mutation
was also found in an unrelated 15-year-old CF patient whose second mutation is yet unknown. Two
cousins of this patient who are also affected with
CF were shown to carry the mutation 1506s in
combination with AF508. The identical 1 1 1 2

NOVEL MUTATIONS OF THE CFTR

Specific heteroduplex formation of mutations 1506s and 1651A-T combined with AF508.
Exon 10 of the CFTR gene was amplified by PCR (Zielenskiet al., 1991), the products were separated
by electrophoresison a nondenaturing 15% polyacrylamidegel, and visualised under UV light with
ethidium bromide. The gel contains 3 control samples without a mutation in exon 10 (lanes 1,6, and
8), 2 samples with AF508/wild type (lanes 2 and 4), and one sample each with AF508/AF508 (lane 9),
AF508/1506S (lane 5), 1506S/wild type (lane 3). and 1615A+T + AF508/wild type (lane 7).

gating with 1506s in both families points to a single origin of this mutation in Bavaria where both
families are located about 150 km apart.
The four patients carrying the mutation 1506s
are pancreas-insufficient; pulmonary changes are
minor so far in all patients under prophylactic antibiotic treatment, including the 15-year-old boy.
One patient showed cholestasis with hyperbilirubinaemia at the age of 3 weeks. The length is
around centile 50 in all four patients, weight is
reduced to centile 25 only in one patient.

Mutation 1651 A+T
When screening for AF508, an aberrant heteroduplex pattern led to the detection of another
novel mutation, 1651 A+T (Fig. 1, lane 7). The
mutation was observed along with AF508 in the
healthy mother of a deceased female index patient
with a severe course of CF. She died from the
disease at the age of 10 years. The father was found
to be heterozygous for the mutation 1717 G+A
(Guillermit et al., 1990). A healthy sister of the
patient has inherited neither the mutation AF508
nor the 1651 A+G substitution from her mother
indicating that both mutations are located together on the same chromosome. The transition of
A to T in nucleotide position 1651 (Fig. 2b) in the
codon for the amino acid in position 507 leads to
an isoleucine to phenylalanine substitution in the
CFTR protein. The newly translated phenylalanine thus substitutes for the phenylalanine residue
lost by the mutation AF508 on the same chromosome, and therefore results in an amino acid alter-

ation corresponding to the known rare mutation
AI507. An A for G polymorphism at the same
nucleotide position 1651 leading to a valine residue at amino acid position 507 has been reported
and seems to have no negative effect on CFTR
function (Will et al., 1992).

Mutation S466X
The SSCP analysis of exon 10 gave an abnormal
pattern in two independent patients who, from
previous screening, were both known to carry the
mutation AF508 o n one chromosome. This abnormal band pattern was not seen in 42 additional CF
patients carrying one as yet unresolved mutation
and the known mutation AF508. Sequence analysis revealed a C to G base change at nucleotide
position 1529 (Fig. 2c) creating a stop codon at
amino acid position 466. Both patients carrying
this mutation are pancreas-insufficient, one of the
girls presents with severe intestinal disease, she
had meconium ileus at birth and now, at the age of
5 years, she suffers from liver cirrhosis and pulmonary disease. The other patient, an 11-year-old
boy, shows mild pulmonary changes and develops
well under therapy.
