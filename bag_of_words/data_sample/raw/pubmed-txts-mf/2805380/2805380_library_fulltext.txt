Hobbs et al. ( N . Engl. J. Med. 317 734-737. 1987) reported a large deletion of approximately
10 kilobases in the 5’ portion of the human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene. This
deletion affects about 60% of familial hypercholesterolernia (FH) heterozygotes in the French
Canadian population. We have developed a rapid, convenient method for the detection of the
deletion using double digestion with the restriction enzymes XbaI and EcoRV. or triple digestion
with XbaI, EcoRV and XmnI, and a 650 bp cDNA probe, radio-labeled using a random
oligonucleotide primer technique. Eighty French Canadian FH heterozygotes were scmncd
for the presence of the deletion. Forty-seven (59%) of them were found to carry the 10 kb
deletion. Using the same method, we also identified a new mutation which was found in four
of the 80 (So/,) FH patients. This mutation has been found to be a 5 kb deletion removing
C X O ~ S2 and 3 of the LDL receptor gene, which correspond to the first two repeats of the LDL
receptor binding domain. Coscgregation of the 5 kb deletion and the FH phenotype was
observed in one family. Possible structure-function relationship is discussed.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized clinically by elevated serum cholesterol levels, tendon xanthomas, and myocardial infarction at an early age (Goldstein & Brown 1983). It is an autosomal
dominant disorder with a heterozygote frequency in western populations of about 1
in 500 (Goldstein & Brown 1983, Brown &
Goldstein 1986). Studies of the molecular
basis of this disease have revealed that mutations in the gene coding for the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor are the primary cause (Brown & Goldstein 1986), and
more than 20 different mutations have been

identified to date (Russell et al. 1986, Hobbs
et al. 1988, Langlois et al. 1988, Leitersdorf
et al. 1988, Henderson et al. 1988).
The LDL receptor, located on the surface
of most body cells, plays a key role in the
removal of cholesterol-rich LDL from the
circulation. The LDL receptor cDNA has
been cloned and sequenced (Yamamoto et
al. 1984), and the gene, 45 kilobases (lcb) in
length, has been mapped to the short arm
of chromosome 19 (Siidhof et al. 1985).
Cloned cDNA fragments of the LDL rcceptor have been used as probes to determine
the molecular basis of the mutations (Rus-

sell et al. 1986, Hobbs et al. 1988, Langlois
et al. 1988).
Recently, Hobbs et al. (1987) reported a
common deletion of approximately 10 kb in
the 5' portion of the LDL receptor gene.
This deletion, found exclusively in a French
Canadian population and shared by 63% of
FH heterozygotes in this group, was
thought to be the result of a founder effect.
This deletion (French Canadian deletion)
removes the 5' signal sequence, initiation
codon, and the first exon of the LDL receptor gene, and therefore prevents the expression of the deletion-bearing allele. This
deletion was demonstrated as a restriction

fragment length variant by genomic Southem blot analysis using double digestion with
the restriction enzymes KpnI and XbaI and
a single-stranded cDNA probe corresponding to exon 2 (Hobbs et al. 1987).
The single-stranded labeling technique
(Church & Gilbert 1984) is relatively cumbersome for routine use in a small laboratory. In this communication, we report a
more rapid, convenient screening method
for the deletion using double digestion with
the restriction enzymes XbaI and EcoRV or
triple digestion with the restriction enzymes
XbaI, EcoRV and XmnI, and a doublestranded 650 bp cDNA probe spanning

exon 2,3,4, and 5 of the LDL receptor gene,
labeled using a random primer technique
(Feinberg & Vogelstein 1983). This method
gives clear, distinct restriction fragments
which distinguish FH heterozygotes with
and without the deletion, and is reliable,
reproducible, and better suited to routine
use.
The Southern analysis with the XbaI/
EcoRV co-digestion also revealed a new
mutation which occurred in 5% of FH heterozygotes studied. We show this mutation
to be a 5 Kb deletion removing exons 2 and
3 of the LDL receptor gene.
Material and Methods

Subjecrs
Eighty French-Canadian FH heterozygotes,
all unrelated to the second degree, were selected for this study. The diagnosis of FH
was based on the following criteria: family

history of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) (<45 years of age), an LDLcholesterol greater than 250 mg/dl, the presence of premature CAD and/or tendon xanthomas.
cDNA Probe Preparation
Clone pLDLR3, a modified pcDVl clone
containing a full-length LDL receptor
cDNA, was purchased from the Repository
of Human DNA Probes and Libraries,
American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland. The clone was grown and
the insert containing plasmid DNA was purified using a rapid method described by
Pfeffer & Mierendorf (1986). The plasmid
DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases PstI and EcoRI under conditions
recommended by the manufacturers (Gibco-BRL), and a 650 bp PstI-EcoRI cDNA
fragment was excised following electrophoresis on a 1.5% low melting point

Results

The French Canadian deletion was originally demonstrated by Hobbs et al. (1987)
using XbaI/KpnI double restriction digestion and a specific-primed, single-stranded
cDNA probe covering exon 2 of the LDLreceptor gene. This showed restriction fragment variation which allowed distinction of
the normal allele from the allele carrying
the 10 kb deletion (Hobbs et al. 1987). As
shown in Fig. lB, the normal allele (N)
produces a 9 kb restriction fragment while
the deletion-bearing allele (D) gives a 15 kb
fragment.
We have tried to find a random-primed,
double-stranded cDNA probe for the rapid
screening of French Canadian FH heterozygotes for the deletion. The random oligonucleotide primer technique is now probably the most commonly utilized method
for probe labeling. Compared to the singlestranded labeling procedure, the random
primer method is very easy to follow and
reduces the total labeling time from 4 h
to 40 min. Moreover, prepacked random
primer labeling kits can be purchased from
many manufacturers, so that radio-labeled
probes with consistently high specific activity can be obtained. We therefore used
the random primer method to label a 650
bp fragment of the LDL receptor cDNA
(Fig. 1A) which spans exons 2, 3, 4, and

part of exon 5. We replaced the restriction
enzyme KpnI in our analysis with one of a
group of other enzymes (mostly 6-cutters)
which were used in combination with XbaI.
KpnI was replaced for two principal reasons.First, the removal of KpnI from digestion removes a common KpnI-XbaI fragment of approximately 15 kb detected by
the 3' portion of the 650 bp probe, which
therefore masks out the 15 kb XbaI-KpnI
fragment carrying the deletion. Second, the
removal of KpnI maximizes the overlap between the probe and target fragments, so
that not only exon 2 but also exons 3, 4,
and part of exon 5 will be involved in hybridization. This ensures high intensity and
reproducibility of the bands seen in the
Southern analysis. A series of double and
triple digestions with XbaI and different
combinations of enzymes was performed in
order to find a combination which would
give higher intensity, better separation, and
consistent reproducibility of the bands.
These digestions included: XbaI/BamHI,
XbaI/EcoRI, XbaI/SphI, XbaI/SstI, XbaI/
StuI, XbaI/EcoRV, XbaI/EcoRV/BglI,
XbaI/EcoRV/HincII, XbaI/EcoRV/HpaI,
XbaI/EcoRV/NcoI, XbaI/EcoRV/PstI, and
XbaI/EcoRV/XmnI. ' h o of these digestions, XbaI/EcoRV and XbaI/EcoRV/
XmnI, showed clean and distinct restriction
fragments (Fig. lB, and Fig. 2). No other
combinations were found to be useful.
Fig. 1B shows a partial restriction map
of the LDL-receptor gene and the expected
restriction fragments. The normal allele is
expected to generate a 19 kb fragment upon
XbaI/EcoRV double digestion, or a 12 kb
fragment upon XbaI/EcoRV/XmnI triple
digestion. The deletion-carrying allele is expected to produce a 25 kb fragment upon
double or a 19 kb fragment upon triple
digestion.

blots are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2A shows

Flg. 4. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from patient FH5272 and the family. Five micrograms of DNA from
each member of the family were digested with the restriction enzymes Xbal and EcoRV and hybridized with the
0.65 kb cDNA probe, as described in detail In the legends of Fig. 1 and 2. The abnormal 14 kb band (caused by
the Skb deletion) was observed only In the members with FH phenotype (112. 113. 1111) in this family. 0 Male. 0

in this study. The first two lanes contain
DNA from two healthy French Canadians,
and, as expected, show only a normal 19 kb
band. The next two lanes (lanes 3 and 4)
represent samples from two FH heterozygotes who were known to carry the 10 kb
deletion, and show a 25 kb deletion band
as well as a normal band. We then screened
80 French Canadian FH heterozygotes for
the presence of the deletion. Shown in Fig.
2B is an autoradiogram of the results from
six individuals. Two of them are carriers of
the 10 kb deletion (lanes 2 and 6), and the
remaining four patients do not have the
deletion. One of these four patients carries
a mutation which gives a 14 kb abnormal
band (lane 5). and the other FH heterozygotes who show no other abnormal band
must carry other mutations in their LDLreceptor gene which are not detectable by
this analysis. Forty-seven out of the 80 FH
patients (59%) were found to carry the 10
kb deletion, and four patients ( 5 % ) were
found to carry the mutation that produced
the 14 kb band.

Since the abnormal 14 kb band is smaller
than the 19 kb normal band, it is very likely
to be due to one of two possibilities: either
a single-nucleotide alteration (point mutation) that has created an XbaI or EcoRV
site, or a 5 kb deletion which has occurred
in between the XbaI and EcoRV sites. These
possibilities can be distinguished using a
simple strategy: that is, to introduce a third
enzyme, other than XbaI or EcoRV. If the
abnormal band is caused by a point mutation, the introduction of a third enzyme
into the Southern analysis should not give
the abnormal band, because the mutation
site would not have been challenged. However, if the observed abnormal band is
caused by a 5 kb deletion, an abnormal
band should always be found, no matter
what enzyme is used. To find out the nature
and the location of the mutation underlying
the 14 kb abnormal band shown in Fig.
2B, Southern analysis was performed with a
group of restriction enzymes whose cutting
sites along the LDL receptor gene have been
previously mapped. Fig. 3A shows the auto-

radiogram of the BamHI digestion probed
with the 650 bp cDNA probe. The first two
lanes contain DNAs from normal individuals and, as expected, have only a normal
15 kb band. The next two lanes, FH6667
and FH5272, contain DNAs from two of
the four FH heterozygotes who were found
to carry the “14 kb band mutation” in the
previous XbaI/EcoRV co-digestion. A 10
kb abnormal band as well as a normal 15
kb band are observed. This indicates that
the new mutation is due to a 5 kb deletion
and the deletion is located in between the
two BamHI sites (Fig. 3A).
To narrow down further the range within
which the deletion is located, an EcoRI digestion was performed. Fig. 3B shows the
result from two normal controls and two
deletion carriers, and the latter show a 4 kb
abnormal band in addition to a 9 kb normal
band, indicating that the 5 kb deletion is
located in between the two EcoRI sites (Fig.
3B). A BglII digestion (Fig. 3C) and an
XmnI digestion (Fig. 3D) were then performed to determine the 3’ boundary of the
deletion. A 16 kb (larger than normal) abnormal band is observed in Fig. 3C, indicating that the BglII site in the third intron is
removed by the deletion. Only a normal 13
kb band (Fig. 3D) is found in both normals
and patients in the XmnI digestion. This
indicates that the XmnI site in the third
intron is not removed, and that the reason
that an abnormal 8 kb band is not seen is
because the probe-hybridizing region (exons
2 and 3) in the fragment is deleted (Fig.
3D).Combining the results of Fig. 3C and
3D, we infer that the 3’ boundary of the
deletion is located in between the BglII and
XmnI sites in intron 3, which are approximately 700 bp apart. Given the location of
the 3’ boundary and the size of the deletion
(5 kb), we predicted that this deletion removed both exons 2 and 3. Two more digestions were performed to confirm this prediction. Fig. 3E shows the result from a KpnI/

XbaI double digestion and, as expected, all
four FH heterozygotes with the 5 kb deletion show a larger abnormal band (19 kb),
indicating that the KpnI site in intron 2 is
removed. Fig. 3F is an autoradiogram of
the SphI digestion and, as expected, all four
of these FH patients show an abnormal 5
kb fragment as well as the normal 10 kb
band, indicating that the SphI site in intron
1 is not removed. The results from all six
digestions shown in Fig. 3 confirm that this
is a 5 kb deletion removing exons 2 and 3.
The limits of this deletion do not coincide
with any of those previously described
(Hobbs et a]. 1988, Langlois et al. 1988,
Henderson, H. E. 1988).
The results of a co-segregation study are
shown in Fig. 4. The 5 kb deletion is inherited in a Mendelian fashion in this family. The deletion also cosegregates with the
FH phenotype.
Discussion

The LDL receptor is a single-chain transmembrane glycoprotein with five modular
domains encoded by 17 exons (exons 2 to
18). The first domain at the N-terminal, the
LDL receptor binding domain, consists of
7 cysteine-rich repeats encoded by exons 2
to 6 (Russell et al. 1986). Exons 2, 3, 5 and
6 each encode one repeat (41 amino acids)
and exon 4 encodes three repeats. One
unique feature about these exons for the
binding domain is that the introns in this
region interrupt the coding sequence in the
same reading frame. Thus, if any one of
these exons is removed in its entirety,
mRNA splicing can still be carried out and
the correct reading frame will be retained.
In the case of the 5 kb deletion, we predict
that the removal of the exons 2 and 3 will
probably not cause any frame-shift mutation of the gene product. The deletionbearing allele will probably encode a recep
tor that is simply 82 amino acids shorter

R A P I D SCREENING OF D E L E T I O N S I N L D L RECEPTOR GENE227

than the normal one, in which the junction
amino acid is changed from the normal valine (Exons 1-2) to the abnormal alanine
(Exons 1-4).
A previous study conducted by Van Driel
et al. (1987), in which oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to remove
specifically exon 2 of the LDL receptor
gene, showed that the removal of exon 2 did
not affect the binding of the LDL receptor
to LDL nor the maturation of the receptor.
However, another study by Leitersdorf et
al. (1988) showed that a naturally occurring
in-frame deletion of 6 bp, which removes
only two amino acids in exon 2, caused a
severe delay of the maturation of the receptor. It is, therefore, of great interest to know
whether this new naturally occurring deletion of exons 2 and 3 has any major effect
on the binding and/or maturation of the
receptor. This study is currently in progress.
The use of the random-primed probe-labeling technique reduces the time required
for preparing a probe to as little as 40 min,
and provides probes with consistently high
specific activity. All enzymes used in this
study are readily available within a reasonable price range. The 650 bp probe covers
a larger region of the LDL receptor gene
than the probe used by Hobbs et al., permitting the identification of the new 5 kb deletion in a subset of our patients.
The 10 kb and 5 kb deletions in the LDLreceptor gene affect about 65% of FH heterozygotes in the French Canadian population. A simple screening technique is presented here, which can be readily used in
molecular genetics laboratories for identification of deletion camers early in life, so
that preventive procedures can be implemented long before complications develop.
