approaches are complicated by an intragenic
recombination rate of up to 12%12 and the
occurrence of new mutations in one-third of
isolated cases.'3 The use of flanking RFLP
markers or the recently reported SSCP analysis of deleted regions'4 might prove helpful in a
fraction of cases, but are limited to informative
allele constellations.
Bulman et all5 reported the first point mutation in the DMD gene. Western blot analysis
of biopsied muscle material indicated a truncated protein. Subsequent cDNA sequence
analysis in the implicated region of specifically
expressed muscle transcripts showed a base
substitution, creating a stop codon within exon
26. RNA analysis, in principle, should be
much more straightforward for the analysis of
the DMD gene since it reduces the size of the

Abstract
The detailed genetic analysis of the
Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy
gene is hindered by the large number of
exons involved and their separation by
huge introns. These problems can be
overcome by the analysis of mRNA rather
than genomic DNA and ectopic transcripts derived from peripheral blood
lymphocytes provide a convenient source
of material. Using reverse transcription
and nested PCR, we show here a comprehensive strategy for the rapid and complete analysis of the coding sequences
from complex genes and illustrate its
potential by the identification of a hitherto undescribed single exon deletion.

Materials and methods
RNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes and reverse transcribed as described
elsewhere,'8 using eight cDNA primers pooled
in two sets of four 'odd' and four 'even' oligonucleotides (50 ng each) in a total volume of
30 1.l. A total of 7 pl of the cDNA products was
used for first round PCRs with eight oligonucleotide pairs spanning the whole coding region
as overlapping fragments. Cycling conditions
were: 30 x one minute at 92'C, 45 seconds at
53'C, three minutes at 72'C, final extension
seven minutes, with 50 ng of each oligonucleotide, 0-2 mmol/I dNTPs, and 2-5 units TaqDNA-polymerase (Amersham, UK) in a total
volume of 50 tLI, according to the manufacturer's recommendation, in a thermocycler
type 60 (Biomed, FRG).
Second round PCR was performed with 1 g1
of the first round product and nested primers
as described above. A total of 5 jIl of second
round PCR products was electrophoresed in
1-2% agarose and visualised by ethidium bromide staining. Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed according to Zielenski
et al"l All oligonucleotides were synthesised
automatically (392 DNA/RNA synthesiser,
Applied Biosystems, USA) and purified on
Nensorb columns (DuPont, FRG). Sequences

and usage of the different oligonucleotides are
summarised in the table.
Genomic DNA was isolated by the method
of Miller et a122 and amplified with 50 pmol of
primers 21F (5'GATGAAGTCAACCGGCTATC, identical to the first bases of exon 21)
and 21R (5'GTCTGTAGCTCTTTCTCTC,
two nucleotides upstream of the 3' end of exon
21) in 30 cycles (one minute at 92'C, one
minute at 48'C, 90 seconds at 72°C, final
extension seven minutes at 72°C) as described
above using exon 55 as parallel control
(55F: 5'GGCTGCTTTGGAAGAAACTC,
55R: 5'TTACGGGTAGCATCCTGTAGGA,
10 pmol each).

Results
Reverse transcription of peripheral blood lymphocyte RNA and two stage PCR amplification showed a truncated fragment in the DMD
patient indicating the loss of approximately
200 bp between DMD gene exons 20 to 23
(fragment 3.2, fig 1). Direct sequencing of this
fragment showed that exon 21 was absent in its
entirety and that exon 20 was directly spliced
to exon 22 (fig 2). Exon 21 is not included in
routinely performed 'multiplex' genoniic
amplifications. Its absence, therefore, could
have been caused either by a genomic deletion
or by the mutation of a splice site junction
leading to exon skipping. In order to distinguish between these two possibilities, exon 21

Discussion
The limited detection rate of DMD gene mutations does not only complicate family studies, but also drastically diminishes the value of
negative results in differential diagnosis.
Nevertheless, the screening for deletions alone
is extremely laborious and time consuming,
since either multiple hybridisations or numerous genomic DNA amplifications have to be
performed. The latter concentrate on the two
deletion 'hot spots' at the 5' end and in the
middle of the DMD gene. Furthermore, not
all exon boundaries are known.
We have previously shown the diagnostic
utility of ectopic lymphocyte RNA by the
characterisation of a new point mutation in the
F8 gene causing haemophilia A,23 and the
detection of pathological DMD gene transcripts in a female muscular dystrophy carrier.'8 Here we show that the DMD gene
transcript, which is distributed over approximately 0-1 % of the human genome, can be

transcribed in only two separate reactions and subsequently amplified in 18 overlapping fragments. By these means we identified a deletion of exon 21 in the cDNA of a
DMD patient, who exhibited no mutation in
standard multiplex DNA amplification.
Analysis of the genomic DNA indicated that
the 'skipping' of exon 21 resulted from a
chromosomal deletion and direct sequence
analysis confirmed that exon 20 was precisely
spliced to exon 22. This juxtaposition results
in a reading frame shift, which in the majority
of cases causes the severe Duchenne phenotype according to the hypothesis of Monaco et
al.24 Here, an in frame termination signal
(TGA) is created 14 codons downstream in
exon 22. Chelly et at25 showed that ectopic
lymphocyte DMD transcripts reflect the
mRNA structure found in expressing tissue
and we have confirmed this observation for
transcripts of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.26
According to these findings, a dystrophin protein truncated after exon 20 can be expected in
our DMD patient. This is in agreement with
the absence of detectable dystrophin in immunohistochemical analysis and confirms the diagnosis of a severe Duchenne type muscular
dystrophy.
To our knowledge, a deletion of exon 21
alone has not been reported so far. The detection of such small deletions outside the deletional hot spots of the DMD gene at the genomic
level would be extremely laborious. Following
the above strategy, abnormal splicing patterns
owing to mutated junction sequences27 might
be as readily detectable as the described deletion. Furthermore, the number and size of our
second round PCR products renders them
suitable substrates for point mutation screening. A number of different scanning procedures are at hand for this purpose. Plieth et aP8
have recently shown that the rapid single
strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)
analysis detected all five CFTR mutations
tested in a retrospective study. Roberts et aP9
recently reported seven point mutations in the
dystrophin gene identified by chemical mismatch detection.
reverse

Thus, all kinds of mutations might be detectable in a single comprehensive procedure
using readily accessible lymphocyte RNA. An
increased detection rate for DMD mutations
would also be a major advantage for differential diagnosis. However, the above procedures
are in no way limited to the DMD gene.
Slomski et aP0 have stressed the ubiquitous
nature of ectopic transcripts by the rather
extreme example of characterising transcripts
of spermatid specific genes in lymphocytes of
adult non-pregnant females. As peripheral
blood can substitute for specifically expressing
tissue, ectopic RNA studies are also suitable
for rapid carrier detection in female relatives of
DMD patients carrying a deletion. Since the
family of our patient currently lives abroad, no
such analysis was performed here. Such applications, however, have already been described
elsewhere.'9 31
Note added in proof
Since submission of this paper, we have identified a genomic deletion of exon 18 in another
patient by the same means.
