ABSTRACT

INTRODUCTION
G6PD deficiency has been known to be a cause of haemolytic
anaemia for over 30 years'. However, the molecular basis of
G6PD deficiency has been clarified only recently2-3. Nearly all
G6PD variants associated with enzyme deficiency so far
characterized at the molecular level result from single point
mutations3-4. The two exceptions are G6PD Sunderland, which
has a 3 bp deletion5, and G6PD A - , which has two separate
point mutations6, as had been previously suggested7. One of
these two mutations (126 Asn —Asp) is found on its own in the
variant G6PD A, which is non-deficient, is polymorphic in
Africa8, and is easily resolved electrophoretically from the
normal enzyme type, G6PD B. This would suggest that the other
mutation (68Val — Met) is responsible for G6PD deficiency.
Because the electrophoretic mobility of a G6PD type with this

amino acid replacement is expected to be normal, the
corresponding phenotype ought to be ' B - ' . Although this
phenotype has been rarely reported in Africa9, we have not
found the Val —Met mutation alone in DNA from about 100
G6PD deficient or from 50 G6PD normal samples we have tested
(ref. 10 and T. Vulliamy, unpublished observations). Thus, it is
not clear whether the 68Val —Met replacement would cause
enzyme deficiency by itself.
In order to resolve this question, we have used site-directed
mutagenesis to introduce the two mutations of G6PD A - , both
separately and together, into an expression construct able to
produce human G6PD in E. coli. We report here that in fact
G6PD deficiency arises in the variant A - through an unexpected
synergistic interaction between the two amino acid replacements
that co-exist in the protein molecule.

RESULTS
Production of recombinant mutant enzymes
Normal human recombinant G6PD was produced in a mutant
strain of E.coli devoid of endogenous G6PD activity". The
enzyme was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography
as previously described1213. Point mutations were introduced
into the G6PD expression plasmid to produce mutated proteins
(Fig.l) which were then purified using the same method. SDS
PAGE analysis of the purified enzyme preparations on overloaded
gels shows a single protein band, and the maximum level of
impurities is estimated at less than 5% (data not shown).
Characterization of mutant enzymes
For each construct we first determined the molecular specific
activity of the enzyme purified to homogeneity (Table 1). Each
of the two mutations of G6PD A - causes some loss of catalytic
activity, and when both are together the effect is approximately
additive. However, even with both mutations the specific activity
of the enzyme is still 50% of normal, which cannot account for
the extent of deficiency associated with G6PD A— in red cells
(about 12%: see line 4 in Table 1).
We next analyzed the yield of enzyme activity obtained in
parallel cultures. Here again we find a decrease (of about 30%)
with each of the the two mutations. However, when both
mutations are present together the yield is only 4%. In order to
make sure that this is not due to different kinetics of enzyme

The high prevalence of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) deficiency in African populations is due almost
entirely to the enzyme variant A - , which differs from the
wild-type G6PD B by two amino acid replacements, 68
Val—Met and 126 Asn—Asp. The non-deficient polymorphic
variant G6PD A contains only the mutation 126 Asn—Asp.
The frequencies of the G6PD A and of the G6PD A - genes
in parts of Africa are both about 0.2. The 68 Val—Met
mutation has not been found in a B background. This could
be because the 68 Val—Met mutation happened to arise in
an A gene in the first instance, or because the 68 Val—Met
mutation alone is not sufficient to cause G6PD deficiency. We
have approached this question by producing G6PD B, A, A - ,
and G6PD 68 Val—Met in a bacterial expression system and
analysing their biochemical properties. With each single
mutation we found a slight decrease in both the specific
activity and the yield of enzyme when compared to G6PD
B. When both mutations were introduced together, there was
a roughly additive effect on specific activity, but a much more
drastic effect on enzyme yield (4% of normal). This synergistk
effect was also demonstrated on thermal stability, especially
at low NADP concentrations. Comparable results were
produced when the replacement 119 Gin—Glu was studied
instead of 126 Asn—Asp. We infer that the coexistence of
the two mutations is responsible for enzyme deficiency in
G6PD A - because they act synergistically in causing
instability of the enzyme.

172 Human Molecular Genetics, Vol. 1, No. 3
production we tested the yield as a function of time during culture
from 2 to 24 hours: the ratio of activity between G6PD A - and
G6PD B was always less than 0.12.
Instability of the G6PD A - enzyme
Since the amount of plasmid (as assessed by inspection of agarose
gels: data not shown) was similar in each culture, the most likely
explanation for the loss in enzyme activity is that the combination
of the two changes makes the protein molecule unstable. Since
the most conspicuous difference betwee G6PD B and G6PD A,
caused by the 126 Asn—Asp replacement, is the change in net
charge, we have introduced a similar replacement, 119 Gin —Glu
in a nearby position. Thisreplacementby itself causes a signficant
loss in the yield of enzyme, but again this is much more severe
if combined with the 68 Val — Met replacement (lines 5 and 6
in Table 1).

It is quite striking that the yields obtained from the bacterial
cultures producing G6PD B, A and A - parallel closely the levels
of enzyme activity found in human red cells from subjects with
these G6PD variants (Table 1, column 5). We have previously
used the temperature-dependence of enzyme inactivation (melting
curves) as a sensitive method to measure differences between
G6PD variants14. By this technique we found that G6PD A has a lower melting temperature than either the wild type or the
single mutants (Fig 2). The difference is especially apparent at
very low NADP concentrations, in keeping with results
previously obtained with the red cell enzyme14. In addition,
immunoblot analysis with an anti-G6PD antibody15 shows
similar amounts of G6PD protein from bacterial cultures
producing G6PD B and A, but only a very faint band from a
comparable culture producing G6PD A - (Fig 3).

Figure 1. The G6PD constructs used in this study. G6PD cDNA'2 (stippled) was
cloned into plasmid pKK233-2 (ref 33) behind the trc promotor. The wild type
sequence (B) was then mutated so as to have, in the three positions 68, 119 and
126 the amino acid residues shown below the diagram (mutated amino acids are
shown in bold). Restriction enzyme sites are B, BamHI; Bs, BstEII; S, Smal:
X, Xhol.

G6PD is a 'housekeeping' enzyme ubiquitously present in cells
at low concentrations4. Some 300 G6PD alleles associated with
enzyme deficiency have been reported, with residual activity in
red cells ranging from less than 3 to 20% of normal4. Numerous
polymorphic G6PD deficient alleles have been characterized in
human populations. For instance, G6PD Mediterranean has a
prevalence of between 1 and 60% in various ethnic groups in
the Mediterranean region and in the Middle East. G6PD A — ,
the subject of this study, has a prevalence of 1 to 22% in
populations in Africa and of African descent, with tens of millions
of people affected, fortunately generally asymptomatic16.
G6PD mutant alleles must meet one or more of certain
requirements in order to become polymorphic. First, they may
be neutral with respect to natural selection; this is probably the
case for the non deficient variant G6PD A. Second, they may
cause a degree of enzyme deficiency in red cells that confers
relative resistance against malaria: thus, they will increase in
frequency as a result of selection by Plasmodium falciparum[1.
Third, they must not cause an enzyme deficiency so severe as
to produce chronic haemolysis; many such alleles exist18, but
none has become polymorphic in any population.

activity, but a strongly synergistic effect with respect to enzyme
activity yield. In other words, the 68Val —Met replacement
causes enzyme deficiency only if it exists in a G6PD A context,
in keeping with the second alternative mentioned above. That
a charged amino acid change (119 Glu— Gin) close to the G6PD
A mutation (126 Asn— Asp) behaves in a similar manner
suggests it may be this change in net charge that renders the
molecule more likely to become unstable as a result of a second
mutation.
Our data do not exclude the occurrence of the 68Val—Met
mutation on its own: indeed, this situation would be expected
to arise, very rarely, by genetic recombination. Since this amino
acid replacement is electrophoretically silent, and we predict that
it would not cause G6PD deficiency in red cells, it is not
surprising that it may have passed unnoticed. It could only be
detected by targeted analysis of normal African subjects at the
DNA level.
Red cell G6PD deficiency in A — is due to loss of enzyme
activity on red blood cell aging22, and in certain experimental
conditions the lowered stability of the A-enzyme can be
demonstrated in vitro. In agreement with previous studies on the
red cell enzyme we find here, using purified recombinant G6PD,
that the thermal stability of A — in low NADP concentrations
is reproducibly lower than that of A and B. The stability of
various G6PD types in E. coli is reflected in the yield of enzyme
from cultures, and it correlates with their stability in red cells.
Since properties of proteolytic enzymes of E. coli and of human
red cells are likely to be quite different, it seems reasonable to
surmise that these mutations introduce an intrinsic instability in
the enzyme molecule. The thermostability data support this view.
We conclude that the enzyme deficiency of G6PD A —, one
of the most prevalent types of human enzymopathy23, results

The experiments reported in this paper were designed to explain
the observation that most of the G6PD deficiency in Africa
(G6PD A - ) is caused by a double mutation (68Val — Met,
126Asn — Asp), i.e. by a second mutation in the rarer A allele
(frequency about 20%), rather than by a single mutation in the
more common B allele (frequency about 60%). This situation
is thus far unique, since polymorphic variants associated with
G6PD deficiency in other parts of the world (e.g. G6PD
Mediterranean, G6PD Mahidol) result from single point
mutations.
G6PD A— has clearly become polymorphic on account of
malaria selection. In principle, we can envisage two explanations
as to why it is a double mutant. (1) If 68Val —Met occurred on
its own, it would be so severely deficient as to be quasi-lethal,
and therefore not susceptible to positive selection. (2) If
68Val —Met occurred on its own, it would not cause G6PD
deficiency, and therefore it would not confer any advantage
against malaria (as has been previously speculated19"21). As for
the first possibility, the experiments reported here show that the
single mutation (68Val —Met) is not likely to be lethal: in fact,
a protein containing this mutation has a specific activity and
stability similar to the normal G6PD types A and B. By contrast,
our data show that each of the two amino acid replacements of
G6PD A — causes a decrease in both specific activity and enzyme
activity yield. The co-existence of the two mutations in the same
molecule has a simple additive effect with respect to specific

174 Human Molecular Genetics, Vol. 1, No. 3
from the fact that the 68 Val —Met mutation has occurred in a
G6PD A gene, which was already polymorphic in Africa. Malaria
selection has then caused the G6PD A — gene to become in turn
polymorphic17. Examples of double mutants are already known
in human genetics: for instance, in the cases of Hb C Harlem24
and of Hb S Antilles25. However, as far we know, this is the
first instance in which a double mutant produces pathology, where
each of the two mutations alone would be asymptomatic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Bacterial strains, cultures and enzyme analysis
For the expression of normal or mutant G6PD E. coli strain DR6121728 was
transformed with the appropriate expression plasmid, pKK233-2 G6PD or one
of its derivatives (selectable with ampicillin). 200 ml of Superbroth medium29
containing ampicillin (50 ^g/ml) were inoculated with 2 ml of an overnight culture
of bacteria, and incubated at 37°C with shaking. After incubation for 90 min,
cells were induced with 4 mM isopropyl-1 -thioiS-D-galactopyranoside, and grown
for 20 to 22 hours to an O.D.550 of 10.4 ± 2.4. After lysis of the cells G6PD
activity was was measured on an aliquot of the extract. From theremainingextract
the enzyme was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography as described
previously12.
Enzymatic assays were performed measuring the increase in absorbance at 340
run according to previously published procedures30. The buffer used in the kinetic
studies was always Tris-Borate 0.25 M pH 8.0 (ref.7).
The technique used to study thermal denaturatkxi ('melting curves') of recombinant
G6PD variants was essentially as previously described14. Purified enzymes were
diluted in NADP-free buffer, containing 0.1 % BSA, and concentrated using
rrucroconcentrator tubes (Amicon). Dialysis was carried out with several changes
of buffer until the concentration of NADP was calculated to be 10 pM. Portions
of the dialysed solutions were adjusted to the specified NADP concentrations and
aliquots of these were heated to the specified temperatures for 7 minutes, placed
on ice and then assayed for G6PD activity. Western blotting and probing with
anti-G6PD antibodies was performed as described previously31.

Ptasmid constructs
All DNA manipulations were carried out by standard procedures26. The
construction of plasmid pKK233-2 G6PD and its use to produce pure G6PD in
E.coli has been described12. Using a single-stranded M13 clone containing the
BamHI-XhoI fragment oligonucleotidc-directed mutagenesis was performed27 to
generate the amino acid substitutions. Oligonucleotides used were: I, GGCATAGCCCATTATGAAGGTGTT, to produce the change 68 Val-Met; II,
GGAGGGCATCCATGTGGCTG, to produce the change 126 Asn-Asp; and
III, GAGGCGCTCGTAGGAGGC, to produce the change 119 Glu-Gln.
The BstEII-Smal fragment, containing the mutation was then checked by
nucleotide sequence analysis and cloned into BstEII-Smal cleaved pKK233-2
G6PD.
