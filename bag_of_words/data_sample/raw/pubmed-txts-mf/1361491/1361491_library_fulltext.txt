Abstract
Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHCM) is an autosomal dominant disease affecting primarily the myocardium. The
gene responsible for FHCM has been localized to chromosome
14 in some families and several mutations have been described
in the #-myosin heavy chain (ftMHC), a candidate gene for the
disease. We recently identified a family with HCM in whom we
did not detect any of the known mutations in the ftMHC gene
(the a/i#MHC hybrid gene and the missense mutation in exons
13 and 9). However, we did observe a novel 9.5-kb BamHI
restriction fragment length polymorphism detected by a
,6MHC probe on Southern blots of DNA from the proband of
this family. Similarly, a novel 3.8-kb TaqI polymorphism and a
novel 4.3-kb HindI1 polymorphism were detected on Southern
blots of DNA from the same proband. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the segment of the ,MHC that
was detected by pSC14 probe. PCR amplification of the distal
3'-end of the i6MHC gene yielded an additional product in the
DNA template from the proband which was subsequently
cloned and sequenced. The sequence analysis showed a 2.4-kb
nucleotide deletion involving one allele of the ,6MHC gene. The
deletion includes part of the intron 39, exon 40 including the
3'-untranslated region and the polyadenylation signal, and part
of the fl-aMHC intergenic region. This deletion was inherited
in Mendelian fashion in an additional three members of this
small family of which only the proband has developed clinically
diagnosed HCM at a very late onset (age 59 yr), the other three
family members are younger and have not developed the disease at the ages of 10, 32, and 33 yr. (J. Clin. Invest. 1992.

Introduction
Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHCM)' is an autosomal dominant disease that affects primarily the myocardium,
resulting in inappropriate growth and hypertrophy. While it is
a cause of heart failure later in life, in the young it is a common

cause of sudden death and is the most common cause in young
athletes (1). The pathological, hemodynamic, and clinical
manifestations of HCM have been studied extensively for decades (2). The myriad of manifestations reflective of diverse
pathophysiology include asymmetrical and concentric hypertrophy, decreased myocardial compliance, and outflow tract
obstruction. HCM represents a paradigm ofcardiac pathophysiology and elucidation of its molecular basis should provide
information fundamental to our understanding of the biology
and pathology of the myocardium. The gene responsible for
FHCM has been localized in some families to chromosome 14
(3-6), and the f3-myosin heavy chain (i3MHC) gene has been
identified as the candidate gene for this disease (3-5). Three
mutations in #MHC gene in two families with FHCM have
been described. The first, an a/f3 cardiac myosin hybrid gene
described by Tanigawa et al. (7) occurred in all affected
members of a single family with FHCM as a result of a crossover event between a- and flMHC genes occurred on exon 27.
A missense mutation in exon 13 of fMHC gene has been found
in all affected members of another family with FHCM (8).
Similarly, another missense mutation in exon 9 of the ,BMHC
gene has been described in a family with FHCM (9). We have
examined DNA from the probands of 59 families with FHCM
and have detected the exon 13 missense mutation in a single
family, but did not detect the a/l hybrid gene in any family.
However, during this study, we identified a unique restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) on Southern blots of
the DNA of a small family in whom the proband has HCM and
showed that it was inherited in a Mendelian manner in two
subsequent generations. Using polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) to amplify DNA from the proband, we have determined
that the RFLP represents a deletion in the f3MHC gene. The
deletion is 2.4 kb long and extends from intron 39 of the
f3MHC gene into the intergenic region between the #- and
aMHC genes. Included within the deletion is exon 40 which
contains coding sequence for the carboxy-terminal five amino
acids, the stop codon, and entire 3'-untranslated sequence.

Methods
Patient studies. Patient evaluation was done as previously reported (5).
Briefly, the proband and all members of family 151 (pedigree depicted
on the top portion of Fig. 2) were given detailed cardiovascular examinations and two-dimensional echocardiography. The echocardiographic criteria for the diagnosis of HCM was defined as the presence of
septal or ventricular hypertrophy with a wall thickness of 13 mm or
more in the absence of other potential causes such as hypertension.
Southern blot analysis. Following informed consent blood was collected from individuals and lymphoblastoid cell lines established by
Epstein-Barr virus transformation (10). DNA was prepared from the
cell lines using a nucleic acid extractor (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). DNA was digested with a threefold excess of appropriate
restriction endonucleases following the supplier's recommendation.
DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and

Cambridge, MA). The /3-myosin probe, pSC 14, provided by H. P. Vosberg, was labeled to a specific activity of > 109 cpm/,Rg with [32P]dCTP
(Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL) by the random primer procedure of Feinberg and Vogelstein (11). Hybridization and washing
conditions were as described previously (5). Following washing the
membranes were exposed to X-ray film (XAR-5, Eastman Kodak Co.,
Rochester, NY) and with Cronex (DuPont Co., Wilmington, DE) intensifying screens at -80'C for 24-72 h.
PCR. Cardiac 3MHC gene nucleotide sequence (GenBank access
no. 52889 [121 and the 3/aMHC intergenic region sequence (C. C.
Liew, personal communication) were provided by C. C. Liew (University of Toronto, Canada). Based on these sequences several sets of oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify 11 kb (10,788 bp) of
the gene and the intergenic region corresponding to that segment detected by pSC 14 probe. The length of the DNA amplified varied from
590 to 4,785 bp. The primers used in the PCR reactions that cover the
total length of the amplified region are described in Table I. All reactions were done using 150 ng of template DNA from the proband and a
normal genomic DNA control, 2 ,d of l Ox Taq polymerase buffer (500
mM KCI, 100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 9.0 at 25° C], 15 mM MgCI2, 0.1%

,MM of each primer, 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Pharmacia Inc.,
Piscataway, NJ), and 0.2 mM of dNTP (except for reaction B in which
the concentration of dNTP was 0.3 mM) in a total reaction volume of
20 Ml. DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer-Cetus, Norwalk, CT) was
used to denature at 95° C for 3 min and a subsequent 30-cycle amplification was performed by denaturing at 94° C for 1 min, annealing 1
min, and extension at 72° C for 3-4 min with a 5-s per cycle increment.

The annealing temperatures for reactions A through E were 590C,
560C, 550C, 570C, and 540C, respectively.
Separation and extraction of PCR products. PCR products were
separated using agarose (0.8- 1.0%) gel electrophoresis. The DNA products were excised from the gel under ultraviolet illumination and extracted using Sephaglas Band Prep kit (Pharmacia, Inc.).
Cloning and sequencing techniques. Restriction endonuclease sites
were incorporated at the 5'-end of the primers to yield PCR products
-with asymmetric restriction sites. The PCR products were digested with
the appropriate restriction endonucleases to create cohesive termini
and subsequently purified using a Centricon No. 100 ultrafiltration
system (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The PCR products with cohesive termini were cloned into a plasmid vector (pGEM) after digestion with the
appropriate restriction endonucleases to create compatible termini. Recombinant plasmid DNA was purified by alkaline lysis method (13).
Sequencing was performed by the dideoxy sequencing method using a
T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia, Inc.).
RNA extraction. Biopsy samples from biceps muscle were taken
after an informed consent was obtained. Samples were immediately
frozen at -70'C and subsequently used for extraction of total RNA
using the RNAzol method (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc., Houston, TX).
Reverse transcription and first-strand cDNA synthesis. cDNA was
synthesized from total RNA by the following method: 0.1 tg of total
skeletal muscle RNA, 2 ,l of 5X reverse transcriptase buffer (250 mM
Tris-HCl [pH 8.3 at room temperature], 375 mM KC1, 15 mM MgCl2
[Gibco BRL, Gaitherburg, MD]), and 15,uM antisense primer in a total

reaction buffer, and 1.5 ,ul of 10 mM dNTP were added in a total
reaction volume of 15 Ml. The reaction was incubated at 420C for 2 h
and reverse transcriptase was inactivated at 680C for 20 min. cDNA
was stored at -20'C if not used immediately. Antisense primers to
exon 40, polyadenylation signal with 3'-untranslated region, a second
polyadenylation signal located 1.7 kb downstream from the deletion
(second polyadenylation primer), the 3'-untranslated region of this polyadenylation signal (second 3'-untranslated primer), and universal
oligo dT,2-,8 primers were used (Table II). cDNA were screened by
PCR amplification as follows: cDNA made by the above method was
diluted 1:4-fold with x PCR buffer (Promega Corp.) and 12.5 ofthe
cDNA dilute was added to 12.5 Ml ofPCR mix containing 0.2 MM sense
primer, 0.2 mM dNTP, IU Taq DNA polymerase (Pharmacia, Inc.),
yielding a final concentration of0. 1 MM sense and antisense primer and
0.2 mM dNTP. PCR was done utilizing DNA Thermal Cycler (PerkinElmer-Cetus) in a setting similar to what was described earlier for genomic DNA. The annealing temperature was 550C. To amplify cDNA
transcribed from the normal allele, a sense primer to exon 38 and an
antisense primer to exon 40 or the 3'-untranslated region were used
with the appropriate cDNA template in the PCR reactions. In an attempt to amplify cDNA transcribed from the mutant allele a sense
primer to exon 38 and an antisense primer to the second polyadenylation signal or 3'-untranslated region or universal oligo dT primers were
used in the PCR reactions with the appropriate cDNA template. The

products of each reaction were identified by gel electrophoresis, extracted from the gel, cloned, and sequenced.
Screening of the I3MHC gene for other mutations. DNA from the
proband was screened for known mutations of the j3MHC gene including the a/,BMHC hybrid gene, the missense mutation on exon 13 and
exon 9, and in addition remainder of exon 9 as well as exons 7 and 8
were screened by chemical cleavage for potential mutations. Screening
for a/JMHC hybrid gene was accomplished by Southern blot analysis
after BamHI digestion of DNA from family members using a flMHC
probe, pSC14, as described earlier. This probe detects a novel 2.8-kb
BamHI restriction fragment if such a fusion gene is present in the proband DNA (7). In the exon 13 missense mutation, an adenine residue
substitutes for a guanine residue in coding position 1208 of the I3MHC
gene

and creates

an

additional Ddel restriction site. The methods of

screening for this missense mutation have been published previously
(14). In brief, primers were designed to encompass exon 13 of the
f3MHC gene which was amplified by PCR. The PCR product (154 bp)
was separated by gel electrophoresis, identified by ethidium bromide
staining, excised from the gel, and purified. The purified PCR product
was subjected to Ddel digestion.
The known missense mutation in exon 9 consists of a guanine residue at coding position 832 (exon 9) which is replaced by an adenine
residue. Using chemical cleavage, we screened for this mutation and
also for potential unknown mutations in the remainder of exon 9 and

7 and 8 (15). The technique of chemical cleavage detects nucleotide mismatches in heteroduplexes composed of a normal DNA strand
and its complementary test strand. This technique is also useful to
detect other mutations such as deletions and insertions. Nucleotide
mismatches occurring with cytosine residues are detectable after the
hydroxylamine reaction. Mismatch thymine residues are detectable
after the osmium tetroxide reaction. Chemical cleavage was performed
as follows: The region of the ,BMHC gene encompassing exons 7
through 9 was amplified by PCR. The PCR reaction contained 250 ng
of the template DNA, 0.2 AM of each primer, 10 mM Tris HCl (pH
8.3), 50 mM KCl, 0.001% (wt/vol) gelatin, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 JM 4
dNTP, and 1 U of TaqI DNA polymerase (Pharmacia Inc., 5,000 U/
ml). Thermal cycling parameters were: denaturing at 94° C for 3 min;
followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 94° C for 1 min, annealing at
58° C for 30 s, and extension at 72° C for 30 s, with a final extension at
72° C for 3 min. The amplified PCR products were isolated by gel
electrophoresis and were excised and extracted as described above. A
exons

secondary amplification of the extracted product was performed using
conditions described by Kogan et al. (16) and the same cycling parameters as in the primary amplification. The reamplified PCR product was
extracted from the gel in a manner as described above. A sense and an
antisense 32P end-labeled probe were produced using end-labeled sense
and antisense primers in separate reactions to amplify the region of
interest from normal DNA. Sense and antisense labeled heteroduformed by mixing

separately with each secondary PCR product being tested and denaturing the mixture at 100° C for 3 min, and subsequent reannealing the
strands at 42° C for 2 h. The reannealed heteroduplexes were isolated
by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 20 pl of H20 for use in the
chemical reactions.
Hydroxylamine reaction was as follows: a 6 ,l aliquot of each heteroduplex was mixed with 20 p1 of2.5 M hydroxylamine and incubated
at 37° C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding an excess of yeast

Tris HCl (pH 7.7), 1 gM EDTA (pH 8.0), and 1.5% (vol/vol) pyridine
and incubated at 370C for 5 min. The reaction was stopped and the
heteroduplexes isolated as described above. The lyophilized products
were mixed with 50 ,l of 1.0 M piperidine and incubated at 90'C for 30

were ethanol precipitated and lyophilized. Chemical cleavage products
were resuspended in formamide and electrophoresed on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. An autoradiogram was developed from the gel
for detection of base mismatches in the heteroduplexes using conventional methodology.

Results
Clinical characteristics. The pedigree of this family has been
depicted on the upper portion of Fig. 2 (q.r.). The proband is a
67-yr-old male diagnosed at age of 59, when he presented with
symptoms of atypical chest pain, lightheadedness, and decreased exercise tolerance. On cardiac examination we detected a S4 and a grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur at mid

left sternal border. Electrocardiography (EKG) showed normal
sinus rhythm and left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities. Analysis of recordings of two 24-h Holter
monitoring intervals showed sinus rhythm with premature
atrial and ventricular beats and short runs of ventricular bigeminy. A two-dimensional echocardiogram showed moderate
concentric ventricular hypertrophy with septal and posterior
wall thickness of 2 cm, a left ventricular ejection fraction of
60-69%, and systolic anterior motion of the anterior leaflet of
the mitral valve. There was also a 25 mmHg left ventricular
outflow tract gradient. Right ventricular endomyocardial
biopsy showed mild hypertrophic cardiac fibers with minimal
focal interstitial fibrosis. The patient has been treated with :
blockers and has done well. Parents of the proband died 37 yr
ago, and their medical history is not available.
The proband has three siblings and the clinical data ofthese
individuals are provided as follows: Individual 4 is 77 yr old
and has not experienced any cardiac symptoms. Her past medical history consists of pancreatitis, gall bladder disease, and
degenerative joint disease. Her EKG showed sinus bradycardia
at the rate of 56 bpm, and left axis deviation of -40. A recent
chest X-ray showed mild left ventricular prominence. An echocardiogram showed moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal left ventricular systolic function, moderately enlarged left atrium (4.6 cm), ventricular septal thickness
of 1.7 cm, and posterior wall thickness of 1.6 cm. Although this
individual meets the echocardiographic criteria for HCM, one
cannot exclude these echocardiographic findings as due to age
alone. Thus, she remains in the category of diagnosis "uncertain."
Another sibling of the proband, individual 5, has symptoms
of exertional dyspnea. She has been hypertensive for the past
20 yr and has been treated with A blockers. Echocardiography
showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with 1.3
cm wall thickness and normal systolic function and chamber
size. In addition, there was also a localized basal ventricular
septal thickness of 18 mm and mild mitral regurgitation. Due
to long-standing history of hypertension, which may be responsible for the hypertrophy, the diagnosis of HCM in this individual remains "uncertain." Individual 6 is a 63-yr-old female and
is asymptomatic with a normal echocardiogram. Individual 13,
a 35-yr-old female, is currently asymptomatic, and is normal
on physical examination. Echocardiography showed normal
left ventricular function with ventricular septal thickness of 1.1
cm and posterior wall thickness of 1.0 cm. However, systolic
anterior motion ofthe mitral valve chordae was noted on echocardiogram. Individual 12, a 33-yr-old female, is asymptomatic with a normal EKG and echocardiogram. Individual 14, a
32-yr-old male, is asymptomatic with a normal physical examination. EKG and echocardiography are both normal with a
septal thickness of 0.9 cm and posterior wall thickness of 1.0
cm. Individual 15, a 1 0-yr-old, is asymptomatic and has a normal echocardiogram. Individuals 10 and 11 (spouses) are both
asymptomatic and have normal echocardiograms (individual
11 is not shown in the pedigree).
Southern blotting analysis. In order to detect large DNA
rearrangements in the MHC gene of individuals with FHCM
Southern blot analysis was performed on DNA from a total of
59 probands using the 3-myosin probe, pSC 14. This probe detects a two-allele BamHI restriction length polymorphism of
3.3 and 1.6 kb with a frequency of 0.7 and 0.3, respectively
( 17). Representative autoradiograms of Southern blot analysis

of DNA isolated from FHCM probands are shown in Fig. 1. In
addition to the expected RFLP and two constant fragments a
novel 9.5-kb BamHI restriction fragment was detected by the
pSC14 probe in a single proband from family 151 (Fig. JA, lane
8). The genomic DNA from all 59 probands was also digested
with TaqI and HindIll restriction endonucleases and probed
with pSC 14. A novel 3.8-kb and a novel 4.3-kb restriction fragment in TaqI and HindIl digests, respectively, were detected
(Fig. l B, lane 8 and I C, lane 8) in the digest of DNA from the
proband of family 151. This polymorphism was not present in
any of the other 58 probands of families with FHCM, nor was it
present in 73 unrelated normal individuals. DNA from additional family members of pedigree 151 was digested with
BamHI, TaqI, and HindIl and probed with pSC 14. Three additional members from two subsequent generations also had
the identical novel restriction fragments on Southern blots, indicating the co-dominant Mendelian inheritance of this polymorphism. Pedigree 151 together with the corresponding
Southern blots of their DNA digests with BamHI, TaqI, and
HindIll are shown in Fig. 2.
PCR analysis. The recognition of a unique restriction fragment by the pSCl4 probe in the proband DNA indicated the
presence of a mutation involving the region ofthe ,BMHC gene
detected by the pSC 14 probe (introns 29-37) or the vicinity of
this region. Several sets of primers were designed to amplify
I 1 kb (10,788 bp) of the ,BMHC gene in segments from 590
to 4,785 nucleotides in length encompassing exons 29-40.
The PCR products using DNA from the HCM pedigree 151

normal DNA template by gel electrophoresis and restriction

mapping. The PCR products from the proband and the normal
control were identical in length and restriction map in all segments (reactions A, B, and C) except for the 3'- end of the
#MHC gene (reaction D). PCR amplification of this segment
using primers to amplify from nucleotide 21,879 (in intron 37)
through nucleotide 26,627 (intergenic region between [BMHC
and aMHC genes) produced an unexpected 2.3-kb product in
the proband DNA, in addition to the expected product of 4.7
kb which was present from both the normal DNA and the
proband DNA (Fig. 3). This implied a deletion, 2.4 kb in size
(4.7 kb 2.3 kb), in one ,B-myosin allele of the proband genome. In order to further delineate the location ofthis deletion,
the published restriction map of the ,BMHC gene sequence (12)
and the restriction map ofthe f3/aMHC intergenic resion (C. C.
Liew, personal communication) were reviewed, in the region of

amplification with PCR (reaction E) produced the expected
3.4-kb product from normal DNA template and proband
DNA template, and an additional 1-kb product in the proband
DNA. PCR amplification of DNA isolated from all members
of the pedigree 151 was performed and the 1-kb product was
found to be present in those family members with the novel
restriction fragments on Southern blot (Fig. 5).
Cloning and sequencing analysis. To precisely localize the
extent of the observed deletion, PCR primers with the asymmetric internal restriction sites at the 5' ends flanking the deletion were used to amplify this region of the DNA from the
proband. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM4Z and sequenced. The sequence analysis revealed a 2.4-kb deletion extending from nucleotide 23,793 of the J3MHC gene through
nucleotide 26,171 of the intergenic region, between a- and
,3MHC genes, which includes part of intron 39, and all of exon
40 which contains the coding sequence for the 3' carboxy terminal amino acids as well as the entire 3' untranslated region (Fig.
6). The deletion extends 1,833 nucleotides into the region 5' to
the aMHC gene. The deleted region is flanked by a 45-bp direct

downstream repeated sequences are deleted in the mutant allele.
Transcription analysis. In an attempt to determine whether
mRNA for the mutant ,BMHC gene allele is transcribed we
performed reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) on mRNA
extracted from a biceps muscle biopsy obtained from the proband of pedigree 151. After extraction of total RNA from the
biopsy sample, cDNA for the normal allele was made using
reverse transcriptase with the antisense primer to exon 40 and
subsequently amplified by PCR using an exon 38 sense primer.
This yielded the expected product of 239 bp (Fig. 7) which was
cloned, sequenced, and confirmed to be a transcription product of the normal allele. A potential second polyadenylation
signal sequence is located 1.7 kb downstream from the 3'-end
of the deletion in the f3/a myosin intragenic region (Fig. 6). We
attempted to make first-strand cDNA from the abnormal allele
using antisense primers to the second polyadenylation signal,
second 3'-untranslated region, and oligonucleotide dT primer.
Using these different primers we were consistently unsuccessful
in obtaining any RT-PCR product.

Discussion
We have detected a 2.4-kb deletion in the 3'-end of the f-myosin gene in the proband of a small family with HCM. The
deleted portion of the f3MHC gene includes a part of intron 39,
all of exon 40 which contains coding sequences for the five
carboxy terminal amino acids, the entire 3'-untranslated region
and a portion of the region between the f- and aMHC genes.
The deletion is flanked by 45-bp direct repeat sequences and
the distal repeat sequences are deleted in the mutant allele.
Such flanking direct repeat sequences are believed to mediate
deletion mutations.
The deletion mutation was inherited in a Mendelian fashion in two subsequent generations of the family. However,
none of the three additional family members with the deletion
2164

Marian et al.

could be shown to have HCM by the clinical diagnostic criteria
used in this study. We cannot rule out the possibility that each
of these individuals will develop the disease later in life as HCM
is characterized by variable penetrance and variable expressivity. These results demonstrate the difficulty which may be encountered in differentiating sporadic HCM from familial
HCM in small kindreds. Clinical criteria alone may not be
sensitive enough to identify all affected family members and
genetic diagnosis is not yet available for all HCM mutations. In
two other individuals of the family, the diagnosis of HCM remains uncertain because, while they have ventricular hypertrophy they also have other potential causes for this such as
hypertension.
We are concerned that in none of the three offsprings is
there evidence of HCM despite having inherited the defect. It is
possible that the disease in the proband is due to mutations
other than the deletion in the 3' end of the f3MHC gene described above. Based on our analysis with RFLP and that of
PCR, we have excluded any other mutation that would have
involved significant rearrangement in the 3MHC gene. The
known mutations of the 3MHC gene, the af/lMHC hybrid
gene, and the missense mutations in exons 9 and 13, were excluded (7-9). In addition, the results of chemical cleavage analysis showed no mutations in exons 7, 8, and 9. Screening of the
whole ,3MHC gene for single nucleotide mutations by a technique such as chemical cleavage (the most sensitive) may require years of study, considering that the j3MHC gene is 24 kb
in length. It is not possible to perform linkage analysis to confirm a chromosome 14 disease locus in this family due to its
small size. Collection of several families may be difficult because it would appear that this deletion mutation is not a common cause of FHCM. We have examined 59 probands and
only one proband had the deletion mutation.
Our unsuccessful attempts to demonstrate transcription
from the mutant allele do not exclude production of a mutant
mRNA. Our failure to detect a transcript using RT PCR amplification may have resulted from the inability to choose the
correct antisense primer for reverse transcription from the mutant mRNA for first-strand cDNA synthesis since all potential
splice junctions cannot be cleaved from DNA sequence analysis. It is not evident from DNA sequence analysis where transcription of the mutant allele if it is made would terminate. We
chose to make an antisense primer complementary to the se1.7
quence around and including a polyadenylation signal
kb downstream from the 3'-end of the deletion. This is the first
polyadenylation sequence downstream from the end of the deletion. In addition, a second antisense universal oligo dT
primer was used to prime cDNA synthesis which was also without success. The other possibility is the low abundance and/or
instability of the mutant mRNA eluded isolation and detection
by PCR and electrophoretic analysis.
It is, thus, not possible given the small size ofthe family, the
insensitivity of clinical diagnosis, and the inability to detect a
transcript from the mutant allele to conclusively prove that the
deletion mutation is responsible for the HCM in this family.
Whether the deletion is responsible for the disease is further
complicated by the observation that the proband did not develop symptoms of HCM until the age of 59, and the two offsprings are only 32 and 33 yr of age. The grandson shows no
clinical or echocardiographic evidence of FHCM but is only 10
yr of age. Thus, if indeed the deletion is responsible for the
disease in the proband, given this exaggerated form of age-de-

pendent penetrance, one cannot exclude the possibility that the
offspring may, in the future, develop the disease. These observations coupled with a family whose size precludes linkage analysis prohibits a definitive interpretation as to whether this deletion is responsible for the disease in the proband.
It is interesting to speculate how this mutation might produce HCM. Studies of the Caenorhabditis elegans unc-54 gene,
which encodes the major body wall muscle myosin isoform
,3MHCB, have shown that a mutation that deletes the 3'-untranslated region (18) apparently results in an unstable mRNA
(19) that produces small quantities of protein product. Recent
unpublished studies in C. elegans (R. H. Waterston, personal
communication) have tested the function of a myosin construct in which an introduced ochre codon results in a truncated protein lacking the last nine residues of the carboxyl-terminal rod as well as the entire 23-residue nonhelical tailpiece.
When this construct is introduced into C. elegans, it produces a
dominant mild unc phenotype, apparently interfering with the
incorporation ofnormal myosin into the sarcomere (R. H. Waterston, personal communication). The deletion mutation in
this family also appears to produce a mild form of HCM. This
may be because transcription from the mutant allele produces
an unstable mRNA as a result ofthe loss of the polyadenylation
signal sequence. This instability leads to only a small amount
of mutant protein from the unstable message which would lack
the five terminal amino acids and would be expected to disrupt
sarcomere assembly or function. In that only a minute quantity
of mutant protein may be synthesized, it is expected that only a
subset of sarcomeric assembly and function will be disrupted
resulting in a mild, dominant phenotype. While it is not possible given the limitations discussed above to prove that the 2.4kb deletion is the cause of HCM in this family these results
suggest testable hypotheses for the role of the carboxyl terminus of 3-myosin in sarcomere assembly and function. It is
intriguing that such a large deletion, involving 10% of the gene,
is inherited in subsequent generations in which individuals
may or may not be affected, and those that are affected, not
until much later in life. Does this mean that only the normal
allele is being translated? If so, why so? Expression of mutant
3MHC gene constructs in appropriate experimental systems
will permit us to examine the role of the 3'-untranslated sequences and polyadenylation on the stability of f-myosin
mRNA. Expression of an in-frame deletion of the carboxyl-terminal amino acids will provide insights to the role of these
amino acids on the assembly and function of mammalian sarcomeres. We are currently designing studies to examine these
questions.
