During a screening for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency among
100 schoolboys in a lowland Sardinian village (Guspini, altitude 137 m), two persons
with incomplete G6PD deficiency were found. They were later subjected to further
investigations together with their relatives to find out whether this was due to an
intercurrent factor enhancing the enzyme activity of the G6PD Mediterranean
variant, known to be highly frequent in the island, or to the presence of a different
G6PD variant.
Quantitative and electrophoretic studies performed on fresh hemolyzates of the
propositi and their relatives soon revealed that the latter interpretation was correct.
Interestingly enough, a paternal aunt of one of the propositi was found to be
heterozygous for both types of G6PD variants, as proved through the examination
of her male offspring, consisting of children with one or the other type of enzyme
deficiency.
Additional studies performed on partially purified enzyme preparations proved
that the three apparently unrelated families were all segregating for the same G6PD
variant, which resembles very closely the so-called G6PD Seattle variant. Since the
occurrence of incomplete G6PD deficiency in Sardinia is, in our experience, fairly
rare, it is likely that the three G6PD Seattle-like variants found in the same village
might have arisen, in a relatively remote past, from a common ancestor.
The purpose of the present paper is to report in detail the genetic and biochemical
studies performed on these families.
METHODS

Screening Tests for Red Cell Enzyme Deficiency
a) The dye decoloration test of Motulsky and Campbell-Kraut (1961) was used.
b) The fluorescence spot test of Beutler (1966) was modified as follows: 0.02 ml
of whole heparinized blood was hemolyzed in 1.0 ml of distilled water; one drop of

this hemolyzate was mixed with two drops of Tris-HCl buffer 0.75 M, pH 8.5,
containing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) (1 mg/ml) and
glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) (2 mg/ml). The mixture was incubated for two hours
(room temperature); one drop of it was then spotted on Whatman no. 1 filter paper.
After drying, the paper was inspected under a long-wave ultraviolet light as in the
original method of Beutler. Under these conditions only blood samples with nearly
100%0 fully enzyme-deficient red cells give nonfluorescent spots, while samples with
partial enzyme activity (as low as 10%70 of normal) give clear fluorescent spots.
By combining these two tests, it was possible to discriminate the severe type of
enzyme deficiency, as found in males hernizygous and females homozygous for
Gdl~editerranean*, from the incomplete types of enzyme deficiency observed among
women heterozygous for this allele as well as among individuals of either sex carrying
other G6PD-deficient alleles (GdA-, Gdseattle, etc.).
c) The test for the cellular localization of G6PD was performed on blood samples
collected in acid citrate-dextrose (ACD) as described by Gall et al. (1965). A considerable improvement in the quality of slides was obtained by resuspending the red
cells in their plasma after the incubation before preparing the smears (S. Piomelli,
personal communication).
Assay of Enzymic Actizity of Red Blood Cellst
This was performed as described by -Motulsky el al. (1966), using a Beckman DU
spectrophotometer equipped with Gilford attachment and recorder.
Enzyme activity was expressed in international units per gram of hemoglobin

One international unit is defined as the quantity of enzyme which reduces one
micromole NADP per minute.

Electrophoretic Characterization
This was carried out by electrophoresis on strips of cellulose acetate gTel ("Ctllogel," from Chemetron, Milan) according to the technique described by Rattazzi
et al. (1967) and on starch gel as described by Porter et al. (1964). In these experiments, both fresh hemolyzates and partially purified preparations of red cell G6PD
were used after dialysis against the electrophoretic buffers to which NADP (2 X
10- M) and 6-mercaptoethanol (10-3 M) were added.
Partial Purification of the Enzyme
This was performed by the first two steps of the procedure described by Yoshida
(1966). The partially purified preparations obtained in this way showed a 60-120* The nomenclature of G6PD variants recommended in the World Health Organization Technical Report (1967) is used here.

fold increase in G6PD specific activity and contained practically no 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase.
Further Characterization Studies
These were carried out following the recommendations given by the World Health
Organization Report (1967).
a) Michaelis constants were determined at 250 C using a Beckman DU monochromator equipped with a Gilford 220 photometer and a Honeywell SC-153 recorder. Reaction rates were determined at six different concentrations of G6P and
eight concentrations of NADP; at least one concentration was lower than the Km
values. Calculation of the regression coefficient of V (rate) versus V/S (rate/substrate concentration) gave the Km values (Dowd and Riggs, 1965). The standard
deviation of the regression coefficient was also calculated, as suggested by McCurdy
et al. (1966).
b) Thermal stability was studied by the method outlined in the World Health
Organization Report, on samples free of ammonium sulphate.
c) Substrate analogue utilizations were determined for 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate
(2dG6P) and galactose-6-phosphate (Gal 6-P) as described by Kirkman et al. (1964).
d) The pH activity curves were determined using the triple buffer technique (Kirkman et al., 1964).

Color Vision Tests
Routine screening was performed using the Ishihara and the HHR tables. Any
abnormal individual was further tested with the Fifteen Hues Farnsworth Test and
the anomaloscope of Nagel.
Blood Group Determinations
In order to exclude instances of illegal paternity, blood group determinations were
performed by the Netherlands Red Cross Central Laboratory for Blood Transfusions, Amsterdam. They included ABO, MNS, Rh, P, Lutheran, Kell, Duffy,
and Jk systems.

Xg Tests
These were performed at the Medical Research Council, Blood Group Research
Unit, Lister Institute, London, by Drs. R. Race and R. Sanger.
Linkage lod Scores
These were calculated according to the method described by Maynard Smith
et al. (1961).
A scertainment
The propositi who led us to the study of the pedigrees presented in this paper
were ascertained in the course of a field study performed in Sardinia. This was part
of a training course on human population genetics organized by the Dutch and Italian

International Biological Program Committees and directed by one of the authors

G6PD SEATTLE-LIKE IN SARDINIA

(MI. Siniscalco, in preparation). The field study included, among other topics, the
screening for G6PD deficiency in 800 school children (500 ed, 300 9 9) in four
lowland and two mountain villages by means of the dye decoloration test and the
fluorescence test.
It was through the combined use of these two tests that the two propositi were
noticed as being the only ones giving contrasting results: while their blood samples
gave fluorescent spots indistinguishable from those of normal subjects, their decoloration times with the Motulsky test were definitely abnormal, being 100 minutes
and 145 minutes, respectively, with an average decoloration time for normal males
of 40 minutes ± 3 minutes.
Additional screening studies performed on the relatives of these two children soon
confirmed the impression that they were carriers of a G6PD variant other than
G6PD Mediterranean. Thus, adequate samples of their blood were collected when
possible and shipped to the main laboratory in Leiden for further characterization.
The incidence of G6PD Mediterranean in the area was otherwise found to be very
high (0.32 + 0.01), as was already known from previous work (Siniscalco et al.,
1966).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Laboratory Findings and Family Data
As stated earlier, and as is clear from the pedigrees in Figures I and 2, the G6PD
variant under discussion was found not only in the two propositi and in their male
sibs, but also among the sons of a paternal aunt of propositus 4292 (Gus 6A: III-8).
Since the segregation of this variant is fully compatible, as will be stressed later,
with the hypothesis of sex-linked inheritance, and since on the other hand the
grandparents of these three pedigrees apparently are unrelated to each other, the
mildly deficient G6PD subjects Gus 6B: III-2, 3; Gus 6A: III-8, 10, ii; and Gus
06: III-1, 2, 3 need not necessarily be carriers of the same mutant allele at the
Gd locus. The same, of course, holds true for the female carriers Gus 06: II-2, III-4,
and Gus 6A: II-8, 9. In the latter pedigree the subject Gus 6B: 11-3 (paternal aunt
of propositus 4292) is a carrier of both the mild deficiency and the Mediterranean
type of G6PD variant, as proven by the segregation of the two types of enzyme deficiency in her offspring.
Thus, although from the preliminary investigations (summarized in Table 1 and
Figure 3) it was fair to assume that we were dealing with the same G6PD variant, its
final characterization was carried out separately on several partially purified enzyme
preparations from the red cells of different individuals of all three groups of sibs,
who had derived their mutant gene through an independent genetic path. The
biochemical findings on the partially purified enzymes are summarized in Table 2.
As can be seen, there is a remarkable similarity among the samples from the three
pedigrees, as well as between them and a sample of the G6PD Seattle variant which
was examined alongside the Sardinian samples for a closer comparison. All the mutant enzymes show a decrease in the Km values for both NADP and G6P and an
increase in the relative rate of utilization of the G6P analogues, 2dG6P and Gal 6-P.
The rate of thermal inactivation is equal to that of the normal controls. The curve

show the same migration rate when compared with one another (±90% of normal
G6PD B).
The enzyme activity in the hemolyzates of the male hemizygotes was found
to be about 25% of the activity of normal males. The female heterozygotes had, as
expected, enzyme activities hardly distinguishable from those of normal females.
Two of them, however (Gus 6B: II-3; Gus 6A: I-4), deserve special mention, having
red cell enzyme activities lower than, and respectively equal to, that found in the
male carriers of the mutant gene.

150

LENZERINI ET AL.

This finding is easily explained in the case of Gus 6B: II-3, since she is, as already
mentioned, also heterozygous for the G6PD Mediterranean variant. The electrophoretic pattern of this subject showed only the slow variant band; this is not surprising, since the G6PD Mediterranean band is very seldom visible even in electrophoretic patterns of male hemizygotes.
As for Gus 6A: I-4, the low red cell enzyme activity can hardly be explained in
the same way, in view of the presence in her offspring of a female (II-6) who appears
to be normal by all the criteria used for the classification of G6PD phenotypes (see

Table 1). Moreover, the electrophoretic pattern of I-4 showed, unlike that of 6B:
11-3, a faint but distinct band with the same mobility as the normal enzyme in addition to the slow variant band. On the other hand, the interpretation of this pattern
as that of a heterozygote GdB/GdSeattle is apparently contradicted by the patterns of
the other four female heterozygotes (Gus 6A: II-8, 9; Gus 06: II-2, III-4), in which
the staining of the faster band was so strong as to cause it to fuse with the slower
band. A possible explanation could be that the X chromosome carrying the normal
allele has been inactivated in the great majority of the red blood cells of this subject.
The genetic classification of the individuals reported in the pedigrees has been
greatly helped by the careful use of the cellular localization test for G6PD (Gall
el al., 1965), which in our experience always allows the identification of individuals
heterozygous for GdMediterranean (Table 1).

G6PD SEATTLE-LIKE IN SARDINIA

151

None of the individuals examined had a positive history of hemolytic episodes.
Direct hematological investigations of the critical members of the pedigree revealed
no abnormalities except for subjects Gus 06: II-1, III-3, 5, who were found to be
carriers of the i3-thalassemia trait.
Blood group studies involving eight systems did not disclose any case of illegal
paternity in the three pedigrees.
Linkage Data
Pedigree Gus 6B apparently is the first pedigree described which segregates for
the two G6PD variants, GdMediterrantean and Gdseattle-like. There are five scorable sibs
in the offspring of subject II-3, with no instance of recombination. Moreover, in
pedigree Gus 6A, the new variant segregates in repulsion with colorblindness of
the deuteranopic type, yielding in the third generation a total of six scorable sibs
and again no recombinants.
The pedigrees were also investigated for Xg types and found to be uninformative
for the study of linkage with this locus.
CONCLUSIONS

The biochemical characterization of the three cases of incomplete G6PD deficiency described in this paper suggests that they are identical.
Although they clearly originated through independent genetic paths and although
no family relationship could be traced by a genealogical inquiry going as far back as
the fifth generation, it is very likely that they may have derived from a common
ancestor, since the village where the three cases come from is small (± 8,000 inhabitants) and highly inbred.
The biochemical data also strongly support the hypothesis that the variants described are identical to the G6PD Seattle variant described by Kirkman et al.
(1965). Since an unquestionable proof of this identity could only be obtained from
peptide mapping studies as performed by Yoshida (1967) on G6PD A and B, we
propose provisionally to designate this variant G6PD Seattle-like.
From our previous surveys, we can conclude that this type of incomplete G6PD
deficiency does not exist in appreciable frequency in Sardinia. Indeed, in a total of
about 2,000 males examined quantitatively for G6PD red cell activity in the whole
of Sardinia over the past 10 years, only four were found showing G6PD activity
values in the range of that expected for this variant.
Moreover, in a random sample of 640 males collected in different parts of the
island, no electrophoretic variants could be found. The incidence of this variant may
instead be appreciable in Greece, where Motulsky (1964) mentioned the existence
of a similar enzyme type and where we found five unrelated cases of it in a total of
300 unrelated individuals (200 schoolboys from the island of Kefalonia and 100
unrelated members of hemophilic families).
Two of these five variants have been characterized (Rattazzi et al., 1969) and found
to be similar if not identical to the Sardinian ones and to the Seattle variant itself.
Thus, it may well be that the Seattle variant did in fact originate in the Mediterranean basin.

152

LENZERINI ET AL.

Finally, it seems fair to conclude that the biochemical and linkage data, together
with the constant finding of a single electrophoretic band in male carriers and a
"fused" or double band in their mothers and daughters, add substantial strength
to the hypothesis that the G6PD Seattle-like variant is indeed due to an X-horne
mutant allelomorphic to the Gd locus.
SUMMARY

Three apparently unrelated families, the members of which carried an incomplete
type of red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with decreased electrophoretic mobility of the enzyme, have been found in Sardinia. Partially purified preparations of the variant enzyme showed decreased Michaelis constants for glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), increased utilization of galactose-6-phosphate (Gal 6-P) and 2deoxyglucose-6-phosphate (2dG6P), normal thermal stability, and a slightly biphasic pH-activity curve.
Very similar if not identical electrophoretic and biochemical features were shown
in a sample of G6PD Seattle tested at the same time, suggesting that this enzyme
may be identical to the variants described. Pending a final proof of this identity,
we propose to call this variant G6PD Seattle-like.
In one pedigree, the variant was found to segregate together with the G6PD
Mediterranean variant, and, in another pedigree, with colorblindness of the deuteranopic type. Biochemical, electrophoretic, and genetic data strongly support the hypothesis that the G6PD Seattle-like variant is due to an X-linked mutant allelomorphic to the Gd locus.
