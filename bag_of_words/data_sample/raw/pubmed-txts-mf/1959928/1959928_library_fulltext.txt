Summary. Segregation analyses were performed for plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) in five Christian Arab kindreds identified through
probands with familial hypercholesterolemia. In this subset of the Christian Arab community, the results were
consistent with major gene determination of LDL-C with
allele frequency (q) of 0.042 (95% confidence interval
0.008-0.079) in addition to polygenic transmission (h 2 =
0.34). The "Lebanese" allele was identified directly by
polymerase chain reaction and H i n f I restriction analysis.
Analysis of this mutation permits direct diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia in most affected individuals
although our results indicated the possible existence of
an additional independent factor leading to elevated LDLC levels. The segregation results for TG indicated the
presence of a major effect, although the existence of a
major gene could not be demonstrated. There was also
no evidence of a major locus effect on HDL-C levels.

Introduction
Previous clinical and epidemiological studies have recognized plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels as important
risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD; Tyroler
1987). High levels of total plasma cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and trigylcerides
(TG) and low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with increased risk of
CHD. Strong familial aggregation of these traits has
been established in many studies (Garrison et al. 1979;
Robertson 1981; Friedlander et al. 1982; Namboodiri et
al. 1984). Examination of the relevant factors determining familial resemblance has indicated that a multifactorial component governed by many genetic loci, as well

as by environmental factors, is one source of trait variability. The presence of rare major genes with large effect strongly influences the variation of some of these
traits.
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal
dominant disease characterized by raised plasma LDL-C
levels, is caused by mutations in the LDL-receptor gene
(Brown and Goldstein 1986). The effects of a host of
mutations in this gene on plasma LDL-C levels have been
clearly delineated in recent years (Hobbs et al. 1990).
The estimated world prevalence of heterozygous FH is 1
in 500 persons. However, in several population groups
the disease is much more common (Khachadurian and
Uthman 1973; Seftel et al. 1980; Moorjani et al. 1989).
In these population groups most FH subjects living in the
same area have the same LDL receptor mutation (Lehrman et al. 1987; Hobbs et al. 1987; Leitersdorf et al.
1989b, 1990), presumably as a result of a founder effect.
Khachadurian and Uthman (1973) observed an increased prevalence of F H in Lebanon. A single mutation
in the LDL-receptor gene (a nucleotide substitution that
produces a premature termination codon and a truncated
receptor) was subsequently found to be responsible for
FH in most of the Lebanese homozygous cases (Lehrman
et al. 1987). The possible existence of other mutations
responsible for elevated LDL-C levels in this community
was also suggested (Lehrman et al. 1987).
The adult Christian Arab population living in the Galilee region of northern Israel consists mainly of Lebanese
who have immigrated from Lebanon over the last two
centuries. In recent years, several individuals from this
community have been identified as FH patients. Ascertainment of all available family members of kindreds
sampled from this Israeli-Arab community to determine
carrier status of the "Lebanese" mutation offers the opportunity to test the validity of methods of segregation
analysis for inferring major genes. In addition it allows
an estimation of the rote of environmental and polygenic
factors in the variability in the FH phenotype.

Segregation and linkage analysis

Materials and methods

Family ascertainment
Five Christian Arab kindreds (7 to 37 individuals in each) were
recruited to the study through probands treated at the Lipid Clinic
of the Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem for hypercholesterolemia and xanthomatosis. The five probands had LDL-C levels
ranging from 188 to 666. Pedigrees were constructed and birth
dates verified through personal interviews with all available family
members and official identification documents. Each pedigree
consisted of at least three generations.

Lipid determination
Fasting blood samples were drawn for determination of total plasma
cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and high density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C). Measurements were performed using commercially available kits (Boehringer Mannheim). LDL-C was estimated according to the Friedewald formula (Friedewald et al. 1972).

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis
of the Lebanese allele
Genomic DNA was extracted from blood leukocytes as described
(Hobbs et al. 1986) and was amplified using the PCR technique (Saiki
et al. 1988) applied as described (Leitersdorf et al. 1989a). Oligonucleotides LM-I (5'-GAGTGAACTGGTGTGAGAGGACCAC3') and LM-II (5'-CTGTGAGGCAGCTCCTCATGTCCCT-3')
complementary to exon 14 sequences that flank the mutation were
used. The amplified DNA was subjected to restriction analysis
using HinfI enzyme (New England Biolabs, Beverly Mass.) and
electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Results were read directly from gels following ethidium bromide staining.

Data transformation

The mixed model of segregation analysis (Morton and MacLean
1974; Lalouel et al. 1983) was used to test for the presence of
major loci. This model incorporates the following independent
sources of variation: a major locus with a large effect; polygenes,
each with a small effect; and a random nontransmissible factor.
The polygenic and the random environment are assumed to be
normally distributed and the major locus is assumed to have two
alleles (A and a). The model involves estimating the following parameters: q, frequency of the major locus allele (a) for extreme
levels of the trait. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the
relative frequency of individuals with genotypes AA, Aa and aa is
p2, 2pq and q2 respectively, where p = 1 - q. Other parameters of
the model include ~AA, ~Aa and ~aa as the phenotypic means and
the phenotypic variance r
among subjects having the same
major gene genotype (AA, Aa or aa). The mixed model partitions
this variance into a fraction attributable to polygenes (h z) and
the rest ( 1 - h 2) attributable to individual environmental effects.
Dominance of an allele occurs when ~Aa = ~AA or ~Aa = ~aa,
whereas the general Mendelian hypothesis allows ~AA ~: OAa
"aa. In addition three transmission probabilities (~1, z2, x3) that
persons of the three types (AA, Aa, and aa) will transmit A to
their offspring is included in the model (Elston and Stewart 1971).
Under Mendelian hypothesis in which types are genotypes, zl, x2,
T3take on values 1, 0.5 and 0, respectively. Likelihood of various
genetic models were computed using pedigree analysis package
(PAP; Hasstedt and Cartwright 1981) and the maximum likelihood
parameter estimates were obtained with GEMINI (Lalouel 1979).
For the mixed model, an approximation of the exact likelihood
was employed. Different subhypotheses were tested with a likelihood ratio criterion by fixing certain parameters to their hypothesized values while estimating the remaining parameters from
the data. Minus twice the natural logarithm of the ratio of the
maximum likelihood in the full model, to the maximum likelihood
in the reduced model, is distributed approximately x 2 when the
null hypothesis is true. The degrees of freedom equal the number
of parameters restricted to values stated by the hypothesis. The
test of hypotheses done during segregation analysis were:
1. No familial transmission (no major locus or polygenic loci effect).

The effects of sex and age on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations
were investigated. Since familial data was ascertained through
nonrandomly recruited probands, the phenotypes in the sample
were adjusted following the method proposed by Morton (1979).
First, all probands were removed from the sample used to derive
regression equations. Then, using the multiple regression analysis,
we modeled each lipid and llpoprotein as a function of the following variables: sex, age, age 2, age 3, sex • age, sex x age z, sex •
age 3, and REL x PHPROB, where REL is the coefficient of relationship of the individual to the proband and PHPROB is the
phenotype level of the proband. Only significant terms were retained. All values were then adjusted to the mean age of men and
the adjusted data were further standardized with their own mean
and standard deviation. Skewness in the distribution of quantitative trait can falsely simulate a major locus unless adequately transformed prior to segregation analysis. Therefore, we applied the
method of MacLean et al. (1976) to distinguish between skewness
and the possibility of comingling. Specifically, the data were transformed as:

2. No major gene transmission (polygenic model).
3. No polygenic effect (codominant major locus model, dominant
major locus model, or recessive major locus model).
To confirm the presence of a major locus, the likelihood of the submodels assuming Mendelian transmission were compared with the
likelihood of the general model with estimated transmission probabilities. To eliminate an environmental mixture of distributions,
we also tested the hypothesis that Xl = x2 = x3 = x by comparing the
likelihood of the mixed model with estimated transmission probabilities. A major locus was inferred if environmentaltransmission
was rejected, while Mendelian inheritance could not be rejected.
We corrected for ascertainment by calculating the likelihood of the
pedigrees conditional on the phenotypes of the probands (Cannings
and Thompson 1977).
Maximum likelihood methods were also computed using the
PAP program to test the linkage between the HinfI site at the
LDL receptor gene and the possible major gene for each of the
lipids and lipoproteins (Morton 1955).

Fig. 1. PCR analysis of the "Lebanese" allele. Genomic DNA was
amplified using the PCR technique. Oligonucleotide LM2 was
end-labeled using [32P-7]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. Following HinfI restriction analysis the amplified DNA was size fractionated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed for 6 h.
HaelII-digested ~x size marker was used. The 153-bp band signifies the normal allele and the 98-bp band, the mutant allele following HinfI digestion. The results obtained for a nuclear family
within kindred FH r 300 are shown. The grandmother (III-14) and
both parents (IV-18 and IV-19) are clinically heterozygous (all
three have hypercholesterolemia and tendon xanthomas). The two
children (V-1 and V-2) are homozygous FH patients with diffused
xanthomatosis and extremely elevated LDL cholesterol levels
(Appendix I). The genotype obtained by restriction analysis of
their amplified DNA correlates well with their observed phenotypes

L D L - C phenotype. A h e t e r o g e n e i t y test (Ott 1983) indicated homogeneity in lod scores at | = 0 across the five
pedigrees. H o w e v e r , it is i m p o r t a n t to note that in two
pedigrees (FH354. FH362), lod score values were less

Discussion
O n e of the main predisposing factors to coronary heart
disease is hyperlipidemia especially an elevated level of
LDL-C. In the general population probably several genes
are involved in the d e v e l o p m e n t of hyperlipidemia. The
L D L - r e c e p t o r gene is the best u n d e r s t o o d (Brown and
Goldstein 1986). H o b b s et al. (1990) have shown that
m a n y different mutations in the L D L - r e c e p t o r gene can
cause familial hypercholesterolemia. O u r data strongly
support the hypothesis that the " L e b a n e s e " allele, an
L D L - r e c e p t o r mutation, accounts for extremely elevated
LDL-cholesterol levels a m o n g m e m b e r s of large A r a b
kindreds living in the Galilee region of northern Israel.
T h e small n u m b e r of families in the study reduces the
possibility of genetic heterogeneity. O t h e r studies based

ceptor sites and the major gene for hypercholesterolemia
(Humphries et al. 1985; Leppert et al. 1986). In several
population groups, single mutations in the LDL-receptor gene were found in most of the familial hypercholesterolemic subjects (Hobbs et al. 1987; Leitersdoff et al.
1989b, 1990; Aalto-Setala et al. 1989).
In the present study, the linkage between the major
gene for plasma LDL-C and the existence of the "Lebanese" mutation combining all five pedigrees was proven.
In two pedigrees, (FH354 and FH362) the maximum lod
scores at | = 0 was less than 3.0. In pedigree FH362 it
seems that the lower lod score is due to decreased informativeness resulting from the small number of individuals investigated. In several nuclear families in pedigree
FH354, it appears that there may be a second major factor resulting in the elevated LDL-C levels. In these families, a number of individuals were observed with LDL-C
levels between 182 mg/dl (III-24) and 219 mg/dl (IV-14)
although they did not carry the "Lebanese allele." One of
these individuals (IV-14) was found to have xanthomatosis and corneal arcus. Haplotype analysis at the LDL-receptor gene locus (through study of the joint segregation
of ten RFLPs according to Leitersdorf 1989a) was done
for his nuclear family as well as for an F H homozygote
that carries the "Lebanese" allele. This patient has LDLreceptor haplotypes 2, 3, and the FH homozygote was
haplotypes 23,23. These results support the conclusion
that an additional mutation is probably responsible for
FH in some individuals from our sample. This possible
heterogeneity was also indicated in our preliminary segregation analysis (Table 5). Our parameters estimated
from the mixed model suggested that the inheritance of
LDL-C in this subpopulation involves both a codominant
major gene and a polygenic component. Support for the
involvement of a single major gene was expressed in four
pedigrees, while the fifth pedigree (FH354) supports additional effects on plasma LDL-C. The possibility of the
involvement of a second distinct mutation in the LDLreceptor has been previously suggested in several FH cases
from the Lebanese population (Lehrman et al. 1987).
Thus, it is possible that in the present study population,
which is believed to be descended from the Lebanese,
the same rare mutation exists in addition to the relatively
common "Lebanese" mutation.
According to parameters estimated in the segregation
analysis (following ascertainment correction) approximately 8% of the individuals of this subcommunity of
Christian Arabs (ascertained through the Lipid Clinic)
are expected to be heterozygous for the "Lebanese" mutation. This number should be judged with caution however, due to the relatively high standard error (0.02).
The prevalence of heterozygotes may thus range from
1.6% to 14.5% (95% confidence interval). The minimal
expected prevalence (1:62.5) is similar to that found in
the Afrikaner population (Seftel et al. 1980), which in
both cases is much higher than the average worldwide
frequency of 1:500 (Hobbs et al. 1990). A similar high
prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia has been reported in other populations (Khachadurian et al. 1973;
Seftel et al. 1980). The reason for the high prevalence of
FH in this specific ethnic group is not known, but it is

probably related, as in other populations, to a founder
effect.
The results in our sample provide evidence that 34.4%
of the LDL-C variance around the LDL-receptor genotypic means may be attributed to a polygenic effect.
From the segregation analysis, which ignores the measured genotypic information, it appears that in this subcommunity (as defined by our clinic) the major gene contribution to the total LDL-C variability is greater (30.4%)
than that of the polygenic variance component (23.2%).
In the general population, due to low prevalence of F H
the contribution of the polygenic component is higher
and the variability at the LDL-receptor locus accounts
for about 1% of cholesterol variability (Sing et al. 1975).
From a practical viewpoint, the present linkage data
indicate that the diagnosis of FH using the PCR technique
on genomic DNA in Christian Arabs living in Israel is
feasible. Examining their PCR-amplified D N A with the
HinfI restriction endonuclease, should provide early diagnosis in the great majority of individuals with familial
hypercholesterolemia. This method can also be applied
to prenatal diagnosis. In addition, our analysis indicates
the validity of segregation analysis in pedigrees with a
known LDL-receptor mutation. This allows estimation
of other components of the LDL-C variability (major
genes and environmental parameters), which may have
therapeutic implications.
Previous studies disagree as to whether triglyceride
levels are subject to major gene effects or are transmitted
through multifactorial mechanisms. The known heterogeneity of hypertriglyceridemia may cause incosistencies
regarding the mode of inheritance. Elevated plasma triglyceride levels can be due to familial hypertriglyceridemia (type-IV hyperlipidemia), familial combined hyperlipidemia (type IIB), remnant hyperlipidemia (type III)
or type-V hyperlipoproteinemia. In addition, polygenic
and sporadic hypertriglyceridemia are also known. Some
authors have suggested that the mode of inheritance is
autosomal dominant with increased penetration in adults
and the gene frequency has been estimated to be 0.005
(Goldstein and Brown 1989). When complex segregation was applied to samples of pedigrees and nuclear
families, there was no statistical evidence for a major
gene in any of these studies (Morton et al. 1978; Williams et al. 1982). On the basis of complex analysis, our
results support a major effect. Yet, the likelihood for a
Mendelian gene was lower than for a major environmental effect.
The high levels of triglycerides in the five families
may be due to diverse etiologies. These observations may
obscure a major gene involvement. A further complication is that ascertainment was based on LDL-C and not
triglycerides. Methods for constructing the likelihood for
data ascertainment in this way have been described (Dawson and Elston 1984) but were not yet incorporated into
the currently available computer software. In the noncarriers, the correlation coefficients between LDL-C and
TG, LDL-C and HDL-C, and TG and HDL-C were 0.24,
-0.09, -0.59, respectively. As the correlation between
LDL-C and triglyceride is modest, it may not be critical
to use ascertainment correction, and thus the estimate of

81
the transmission probabilities u n d e r the unified m o d e l
m a y in part reflect the inappropriate ascertainment correction.
L o w levels o f H D L - C are also of clinical i m p o r t a n c e
b e c a u s e of the well-established inverse relationship between these levels and c o r o n a r y heart disease (Castelli et
al. 1977; G o l d b o u r t 1979). Several genetic disorders related to extreme levels o f H D L - C have b e e n described
( H a v e l et al. 1980; Franceschini et al. 1980; G l o m s e t et
al. 1983). O u r lack o f evidence for a single locus with a
major effect o n H D L - C levels in these five pedigrees,
eliminates in our analysis these k n o w n genetic disorders.
T h e present analysis indicates that a m o d e s t a m o u n t of
triglyceride and H D L - C variability was due to polygenic
effect. It is the goal o f the m e a s u r e d g e n o t y p e a p p r o a c h
to partition this polygenic contribution into the contribution o f individual m e a s u r e d loci. T h e clustering o f the
apolipoprotein A I - C I I I - A I V genes o n c h r o m o s o m e 11
as well as the clustering o f apolipoprotein C I - C I I and E on
c h r o m o s o m e 19 suggest that R F L P s in these gene clusters could be associated with triglyceride and H D L - C
levels (Karathanasis et al. 1983; Rees et al. 1983). It would
be of interest to d e t e r m i n e these p o l y m o r p h i s m s in highrisk families to e x a m i n e their effects o n triglyceride and
H D L - C concentrations. I n particular, it would be important to examine the possible effect of interactions between the L D L - r e c e p t o r locus and the other genes on the
p h e n o t y p i c expressions o f lipid and lipoprotein levels.
