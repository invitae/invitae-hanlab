P-Ketothiolase deficiency is a deficiency in mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (T2). We present
here an update on mutations and polymorphisms in the human T 2 gene. N o large deletion or insertion
has been observed in Southern blot analysis. Seventeen mutations were identified in 13 T2-deficient
patients: nine missense, one nonsense, and five splice-site mutations, and two small deletions. Two
polymorphic base substitutions were also detected. A common mutation in T 2 deficiency has not been
detected but 4 mutations (N158D, Q272X, 8 2 8 + 1, 1 1 6 3 + 2 ) were identified in two independent
families. Eleven of 25 mutant alleles identified caused aberrant splicing. In vivo expression analysis of
13 mutant cDNAs using a Lipofectin reagent suggested that T297M, A301P, and A380T mutant
alleles retain 5-10% normal T 2 activity. A correlation between clinical phenotype and genotype in T 2

BACKGROUND
Clinical Presentation of Mitochondrial
Acetoacetyl-CoA Thiolase Deficiency
Mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (T2)
deficiency is commonly known as P-ketothiolase
deficiency (McKusick catalogue number 203750).
Since the first patient was identified in 1971
(Daum et al., 1971), data on more than 30 patients have been reported (unpublished included).
This disorder is characterized by intermittent ketoacidotic attacks and increased urinary excretion
of 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyrate,
2-methylacetoacetate, and tiglylglycine, derived from intermediate
metabolites in isoleucine catabolism, together with
ketone bodies, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate. Severity of such symptoms varies with the
patient. About one-half the number of patients
develop severe attacks associated with unconsciousness, some die during an attack or are mentally retarded. Some patients who are putative candidates for this disorder have normal T2 activity
(Iden et al., 1990).

Thiolases and Thiolase Deficiencies
Mammalian tissues carry at least 5 thiolases
(Middleton, 1973; Miyazawa et al., 1980; Uchida
et al., 1992): T2, mitochondrial 3-ketoacyl-CoA
thiolase (Tl), mitochondrial enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase trifunctional protein (TFP),
cytosolic acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (CT), and peroxisomal3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (PT). They differ in substrate specificity and/or intracellular localization. Human cDNAs for these thiolases have
been cloned (T2: Fukao et al., 1990; T I : Abe et
al., 1993; PT: Fairbairn and Tanner, 1989; CT:
Song et al., 1994; TFP: Kamijo et al., 1994).
There is 3 5 4 6 % homology among the deduced
amino acid sequences of these thiolases.
P-Ketothiolase deficiency was confirmed to be
due to T2 deficiency, based on the following obReceived June 10, 1994 accepted August 2, 1994

servations: (1) only T2 is responsible for cleavage
of 2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA in isoleucine catabolism (Middleton and Bartlett, 1983); (2) potassium
ion-activated acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase activity, a
specific property of T2 (Middleton, 1973) is deficient in patients with P-ketothiolase deficiency
(Robinson et al., 1979); and (3) defects in T2
biosynthesis are present in fibroblasts from patients
with this disorder, as noted in pulse-chase experiments (Yamaguchi et ai., 1988; Nagasawa et al.,
1989). Deficiencies of other thiolases have also
been reported and symptoms differ from those related to T2 deficiency (CT: DeGroot et al., 1977;
Bennett e t al., 1984, PT: Schram et al., 1987;
TFP: Wanders et al., 1992), although gene mutations in these deficiencies have not been detected.
Therefore, the term “p-ketothiolase deficiency”
seems imprecise when referring to T2 deficiency
alone.
T2 Protein and Gene
Human T2 is a homotetramer of the 41-kd subunit (Middleton, 1973; Fukao et al., 1990). The
active site for acyl-S-enzyme intermediate formation of pig T2 was determined to be a cysteine
residue (Gehring and Harris, 1970), corresponding
to 1 2 T y s in the precursor of human T2. Another
active site for deprotonation towards acetoacetylCoA formation was proposed to be a cysteine residue of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase of Zoogloea ramigera (Masamune et al., 1989a,b), corresponding to
413Cysin the precursor of human T2. An anti-[rat
T2] antibody can immunoprecipitate human T2
without cross-reactivity with other thiolases (Yamaguchi et al., 1988). Rat and human T2 cDNAs
were cloned and sequenced (Fukao et al., 1989,
1990). Human T2 cDNA is about 1.5 kb long and
is encoded for a precursor of 427 amino acids, including a 33-amino acid leader polypeptide. The
T2 gene spans approximately 27 kb, contains 12
exons (Kano et al., 1991), and is located at
1lq22.3-q23.1 (Masuno e t al., 1992).
MUTATIONS AND POLYMORPHISMS
We investigated 17 T2 deficient patients at the
protein and gene levels (Table 1). Table 2 shows
mutations, polymorphisms, and their characteristics. Nomenclature for mutations is according to
Beaudet and Tsui (Beaudet and Tsui, 1993), except that the first residue of the initiator ATG
triplet is designated herein as nucleotide number 1.
These mutations were all identified by our research
teams. The references for case reports and mutations are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Although there

is no common pathogenic mutation in the T2
gene, which causes the disease in many patients,
four mutations-N158D,
Q272X, 828+ 1, and
1163 2-were each identified in two families.
While mutations are widely distributed in the T2
gene, one third are located around exon 11 (Figure
1). Homozygotes accounted for only 3 of 13 patients. Analysis of the four cases of T2 deficiency,
GK03, GK12, GK13, and GK14, for which we
have not found mutations, is underway in our laboratories. In GK03 the amount of T2 mRNA is
known to be extremely decreased (Fukao et al.,

+

1991).
Point Mutations Causing a Single
Amino Acid Change

Nine missense mutations were identified; M 1K
identified in GK08 is a mutation located in the
translation-initiation codon that severely hinders
T2 mRNA translation (<5% normal). G379V in
GK07 and A380T in GK06 alter residues located
in the most conserved region (T2 amino acid residues: 378-393) yet are reported among the thiolases, the amino acid sequence of which can be
summarized as G-G-A-I/V-SA/’-L/I-G-H-P-I/L-G
__
X-S/T-G-A/S-R (Song et al., 1994). Both mutant
T2 subunits with G379V or A380T are unstable,
suggesting that this conserved region is important
for stability of thiolase proteins, although the precise role of the region is unknown. There is no
mutation at active site residues, 1 2 T y s or 413Cys.

A Nonsense Mutation

Q272X is a nonsense mutation detected at base
13 upstream from the 5’ splice site of intron 8,
identified in GK07 and GK15. This mutation was
first identified as a possible cause of exon 8 skipping in GK07. We clarified by in vivo splicing
experiments that the single base substitution was
responsible for skipping of exon 8, in some transcripts. It was reported that some nonsense mutations facilitate skipping of an exon (Dietz et al.,
1993). However, mini genes used for our in vivo
splicing experiments lost the valid open reading
frame. Hence, for exon skipping, the Q272X mutation need not be a nonsense mutation. This substitution is thought to alter a putative secondary
structure around the splice donor site of intron 8
and thus impede normal splicing. The mRNA with
Q272X was not detected in GK07 fibroblasts; it is
unstable because of a premature termination.
Splice Mutations

is that aberrant splicing occurs in more than one-

this skipping is attributed to a gt to tt transversion

GK15, and a 68-bp deletion involving the 3‘ splice

Polymorphisms

Six distinct types (A to F) of mutant cross-reactive materials (CRM) were observed in pulsechase experiments of fibroblasts (Yamaguchi et al.,
1988; Nagasawaet al., 1989; Fukao et al., 1993; Wakazono et al., 1995). These CRM types can provide
a functional classification of mutations (Table 3).

One polymorphism (A5P) identified in the coding region of the leader sequence is a G to C transversion at n t 13, which changes Ala5 to Pro and
creates a newly MspI site. The other polymorphism, a C to T transition, locates in intron 9,

In vivo expression analysis using Lipofectin led to a
more efficient transfection than did the use ofTransfect Ace, when the same protocol was used (Wakazono et al., 1995); for example, in the normal T2
cDNA-transfection, the average acetoacetyl-CoA
thiolase activity in the presence of potassium ion
was 301 mU/mg protein with Lipofectin (unpublished data) and 162 mU/mg protein with TransfectAce (Wakazono et al., 1995). Residual activities that we failed to detect in fibroblasts could be
evaluated by an overexpression of mutant proteins.
In immunoblot analysis following in vivo expression, CRMs from mutant cDNAs with G183R1
T297M1A301P, and A380T, were clearly evident.
MlK, frameshift mutations (149delC) 1163
2), AE85, nonsense mutation (Q272X), and mutations causing the skipping of exon 8 or exon l l
produce no detectable CRM (type A), with no
residual activity. G152A, G379V, and A380T mutations produce normal-sized unstable CRM (type
B). However, the mutant subunit with G152A or
G379V was not detected, even with Lipofectin
transfection, while that of A380T was detected
with 7% normal activity and only with Lipofectin

transfection. G183R generates normal-sized and
relatively unstable CRM (type C), with no residual
activity. T297M causes a normal-sized stable CRM
(type D), with 10% normal activity. N158D and
A333P mutations result in unstable CRM with an
aberrant mobility (type E) and with no residual
activity. A301P mutation produces relatively unstable CRM with a slightly slower electrophoretic
mobility (type F). Our study failed to show residual
activity in the A301P subunits (Wakazono et al.,
1995). However, Lipofectin transfection of the
mutant cDNA revealed a low residual activity (5%
normal). The aberrant mobilities of N 158D,
A301P, and A333P do not reflect net charge
change of T2 subunits, suggesting that these mutations are located in the internal molecule of T2
subunit. We have not done kinetic studies for mutant T2 proteins expressed in vivo since larger
scale-expression experiments are needed. Based on
in vivo expression analysis, we classified the 17
mutations, in order of T2 residual activity, as follows: T297M (10% residual activity) >A380T
(7%) >A301P (5%) >the other 14 mutations (no
detectable activity).

CLINICAL RELEVANCE

of T2 in acetoacetyl-CoA degradation except dur-

There is no obvious correlation between clinical
phenotypes and gene mutations in T2-deficient patients. T297M in GK11, A380T in GK06, and
A301P in GK16 would be predicted to be phenotypically “mild” mutations, since residual activity
is present. However, GK11 presented with a severe
ketoacidotic attack with a similar degree of organic
aciduria seen in other patients, although his development is normal. A patient with A380T is mentally retarded and GK16 with A301P died during a
severe attack. On the other hand, 10 patients with
“severe” gene mutations also showed essentially
similar symptoms to the previous 3 patients; eight
patients are not mentally retarded; GK05, in particular, is now over thirty years of age and has
experienced no evident attacks; GKOl and GK02
are mentally retarded. Therefore, it may be inappropriate to predict the severity of symptoms or
prognosis from the genotypes. It is noteworthy that
most patients experienced no further severe attack
after being diagnosed as having T2 deficiency;
most patients were put on a mild protein restriction diet and some received initial therapy such as
intravenous glucose infusion, in situations that
may be associated with acute decompensations,
such as febrile illness and fasting. In this disorder,
ketoacidotic attacks can be avoided and normal
development can be expected, even in severe genotypes. Neonatal decompensation is rare in T2
deficiency but in one patient, an attack occurred at
the age of 4 weeks (Sovik, 1993). Early diagnosis,
including prenatal diagnosis (see below) and
proper follow-up are recommended in cases of siblings of T2 deficient cases.
Of note, in mitochondria, acetoacetyl-CoA can
also be degraded by T1; in human fibroblasts, T 1
appears to account for about 15% of the acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase activity (Yamaguchi et al.,
1988). It may be that T1 compensates for the lack

ing periods of rapid lipolysis such as fasting. It
seems likely that the severity in this disease correlates better with environmental or acquired factors
than with the T2 genotype.

DIAGNOSTIC RELEVANCE
Mutations in the T2 gene are highly heterogeneous; hence diagnostic applications are restricted.
Screening for previously identified mutations in a
patient suspected of T2 deficiency is less useful for
diagnosis than in diseases in which one or a few
mutations cause the majority of cases such as medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency
(Tanaka et al., 1992). Prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection in a family in whom mutation(s)
have been identified are the best available diagnostics. Genomic amplification followed by a concise method such as SSCP, a heteroduplex detection by mutation detection enhancement (MDE)
gel electrophoresis, restriction enzyme assay appears to be a rapid and reliable method. We diagnosed the fetus of the GK16 family as being a carrier of 828+ 1 mutation (Fukao et al, 1995);
carrier detection in GK15 family was also done. As
far as examined, 17 T2 deficient cells have no
detectable CRM or faint CRM in immunoblot
analysis. In some T2-deficient families with unknown mutations, a prenatal diagnosis can be done
promptly by a combination of haplotyping by TqI
and MspI polymorphisms and immunoblot analysis, with the use of amniocytes.
In mutation analysis of a newly identified patient, new mutation(s) rather than recurrent ones
should be given attention. In such cases, base substitutions identified are mutations responsible for
T2 deficiency, or polymorphisms, must be confirmed. Increasing numbers of mutations recorded
in the catalogue and characterization are needed
for a better understanding of T2 deficiency. Func-

GENE MUTATIONS OF P-KETOTHIOLASE DEFICIENCY

tional analysis of mutations will also provide biological relevance of amino acid residues not only in
T2, but also for other thiolases. Our screening
strategy for detecting mutations at the genomic
level covers only each exon and exon-intron
boundaries. Even if no mutation is identified in
such an analysis, one cannot conclude that the
patient does not have T2 deficiency. We have to
date found no mutations in an enzymatically confirmed T2-deficient patient (GK03). The 5’ flanking region, including promotors and enhancers are
