at physiological concentrations (10- 10 M) of androgen when wild-type AR was transfected into cells,
whereas neither AR mutants R774C nor R831Q were
able to stimulate CAT activity even at 10-s M androgen. AR mutant V866M was able to stimulate CAT
activity but the androgen dose dependency was
shifted toward pharmacological concentrations of
steroid that exceed in vivo levels.
The molecular basis of CAIS in humans exhibits
genetic heterogeneity.· Our study shows that some
cases of CAIS are explained by an inability to form
a functional AR-steroid complex and hence, the AR
is unable to activate transcription of genes essential
for male sex differentiation during fetal development. (Molecular Endocrinology 4: 1759-1772, 1990)

Mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) are thought
to cause complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS) in
46,XY human subjects who have a female phenotype
despite normal adult male concentrations of plasma
testosterone. Assays of AR binding in cultured skin
fibroblasts from subjects with CAIS show either an
apparent absence of AR (AR-) or normal levels of
AR (AR+) binding. In several subj~cts with CAIS,
AR-, no gross AR mutation was detected by South·
ern blot analyses of genomic DNA and normal sized
10 kilobase mRNA was present on Northern blots of
poly(A+) RNA from cultured genital skin fibroblasts.
We have used the polymerase chain reaction to
amplify individual exons within the human AR gene
of subjects with CAIS and have identified point mutations in three subjects. In one AR- subject
(R774C), amino acid 774 was changed from arginine
(CGC) to cysteine (TGC), in another AR- subject
(R831Q), arginine (CGA) was changed to glutamine
(CAA) at position 831, and in an AR+ subject
(V866M) a methionine (ATG) was substituted for
valine (GTG) at position 866. '
Transfection of wild type and mutant AR cDNA
clones into COS cells results in detection of AR
protein by immunoblotting. AR ligand binding activity
is absent in cells transfected with AR mutants R774C
and R831Q, but present with AR mutant V866M.
Androgen binding in cells transfected with AR mutant V866M has a 6-fold lower apparent binding
affinity than that of wild-type AR. Transcriptional
activation of the MMTV·CAT reporter gene was androgen dependent and specific and nearly maximal

INTRODUCTION

The androgen insensitivity syndrome is an X-chromosome linked disorder expressed in 46,XY human subjects (1 ). Variable phenotypic expression has been observed, ranging from a complete female phenotype to
male genitalia with mild hypospadias (1 ). Evidence suggests also that the syndrome includes some rare cases
of phenotypically normal males with azoospermia (2, 3).
In the complete form of androgen insensitivity syndrome
(CAIS), affected subjects present a female external
genitalia but with a short vagina and absent Mullerian
ducts. Gonads are normal-size testes located in the
abdominal or inguinal area with hypoplastic Wolffian
derivatives. At puberty, normal female secondary sex
characteristics occur, but pubic hair is usually sparse
or absent. In adulthood, serum testosterone and LH

concentrations are at or above the normal adult male
range.
Multiple studies have demonstrated that this syndrome is caused by target organ insensitivity to the
actions of testosterone and its more potent 5a-reduced
metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (1, 4). Although
testosterone is able to induce fetal differentiation and
development of the Wolffian duct system, the biologically more active androgen, DHT, is required for differentiation and development of the prostate gland and
for the male external genitalia (5). Androgenic effects
during fetal development require the formation of a
biologically active androgen receptor-steroid complex
(6). An impairment in androgen receptor (AR) function
can account for target organ insensitivity and evidence
for such impairment has been reported for numerous
families with androgen insensitivity (AIS) (1, 4).
The AR belongs to the subfamily of steroid hormone
receptors within a larger family of nuclear proteins that
likely evolved from a common ancestral gene (7, 8).
Structurally, the 110 kilodalton AR contains an amino
terminal region that is variable in length and may have
a role in transcriptional activation, a central, cysteinerich hydrophilic DNA-binding domain, as well as a carboxyl terminal hydrophobic hormone-binding domain.
After hormone binding, the DHT-AR complex, probably
as a dimer, interacts with hormone response elements
on specific target genes to modulate the transcriptional
activity of their promoters (9, 10).
The heterogeneity in phenotypic expression of AIS is
due to a variety of AR defects, some of which are
detectable by biochemical methods (1, 4). For example,
AR binding in cultured genital skin fibroblasts of subjects with CAIS may be undetectable, in the so-called
receptor negative (AR-) form (11 ), whereas others have
quantitatively normal binding, termed the receptor positive (AR+) form (12). Cloning of human cDNA encoding
the AR has been reported (13-16). Using cDNA probes
for the human AR gene, we have previously detected
a partial deletion in the steroid-binding domain in one
family with CAIS, AR- (17). However, five other families
with CAIS, AR- did not have any detectable gross
molecular lesion in their AR gene, suggesting a point
mutation or small undetected deletion or insertion. In
one other family with the AR+ form of CAIS (18), we
have reported a missense point mutation' in the steroidbinding domain of the AR gene that predicted a single
amino acid substitution at position 866 of the AR protein
(19).
In this report, we demonstrate that mutant ARs resulting from point mutations causing single amino acid
substitutions in the steroid binding domain of the protein
are functionally defective. In two unrelated families with
the AR- form of CAIS, the two different mutant ARs
are expressed but do not bind androgen and are defective in transcription activation. In the family with CAIS,
AR+, the mutant AR binds androgen with significantly
lower affinity and its ability to activate transcription is
dependent upon higher concentrations of hormone.

RESULTS
Identification of AR Mutations

Previous studies from our laboratory using various human AR cDNA probes to screen for AR mutations on
Southern blots prepared by restriction endonuclease
digestion of genomic DNA from human subjects with
CAIS showed a partial gene deletion in only one affected family (17). Seven other unrelated families
showed no deletion, suggesting that point mutations or
small, undetectable deletions or insertions are responsible for the androgen insensitivity. Poly(A+) RNA was
prepared from genital skin fibroblasts of eight affected
human subjects with complete AIS, seven with the ARform and one with the AR+ form. Except for the one
subject with a partial gene deletion (subject B), a normal
size 10 kilobase (kb) AR mRNA is detected in all subjects (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that the AR
gene is transcribed normally in subjects with CAIS,
even in subjects D-1 with no detectable AR binding
activity in cultured fibroblasts.
In order to identify the AR mutations present in
subjects with CAIS, we analyzed individual exons of
the human AR gene by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) after amplification of genomic DNA by
the polymerase chain reaction. The 5' -oligonucleotide
primers in each amplification reaction contained a 40base pair (bp) G-C sequence which functioned as a
highly stable DNA duplex clamp in the DGGE. For two
subjects with CAIS, AR-, we observe an altered mobility for exons 6 and 7 (Fig. 2, subject 5). We also
observe altered mobility on DGGE of the amplified exon
7 DNA fragment from the subject with CAIS, AR+ (Fig.
2, subject 4). Two additional amplifications of either
exon 6 or 7 from the genomic DNA of these subjects
were performed. Each exon was sequenced in both 5' and 3'-directions by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. A single nucleotide base substitution
is detected in each of the three AR gene sequences
(Fig. 3). For one subject with CAIS, AR-, a c-T base
change occurs in exon 6 resulting in the amino acid
substitution of cysteine (TGC) for the wild-type arginine
(CGC) at position 77 4 (AR R77 4C). In exon 7 of the
other subject with CAIS, AR-, a G--" A base substitution occurred to alter the codon for amino acid 831
from CGA (arginine) in the wild-type sequence to CAA
(glutamine) (AR R831 Q). We also confirmed our previously published observation (19) by our current methodology, the detection of a G--" A base change in exon
7 for the subject with the AR+ form of CAIS, resulting
in the substitution of methionine (ATG) for the wild-type
valine (GTG) at position 866 (AR V866M).
Inheritance of AR Mutations

If these point mutations in the human AR gene are
associated with CAIS, they should conform to an Xlinked recessive pattern of inheritance in affected pedigrees. Point mutations affecting amino acids 774 and

Fig. 2. Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis of Human AR
Exon 7
GC-clamped PCR fragments of exon 7 were electrophoresed in a denaturing gradient gel with 20-80% denaturant.
PCR amplified DNA fragments were from genomic DNA of
normal subjects (wt, wild-type) and those with CAIS of the
AR- or AR+ form or the partial form of AIS (subject 10), with
reduced receptor binding, AR±. CAIS subject 4 (AR+) has
mutation V866M and subject 5 (AR-) has mutation R831 Q.

831 were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis of
the amplified DNA fragments from exons 6 and 7,
respectively. The AR-R831 Q nucleotide substitution
abolishes a restriction endonuclease cleavage site
shared by BstBI and Taql within the 417-bp DNA frag-

ment containing exon 7. BstBI digestion of amplified
DNA fragments from exon 7 of wild-type, two affected
46,XY family members and the obligate heterozygous
46,XX females from two generations demonstrates the
expected restriction fragments from the mutant or wildtype genes (Fig. 4). In addition, the AR-R774C mutation
abolishes the Kpnl site in genomic DNA or the PCR
amplified DNA fragment in the 5'-portion of exon 6 from
the affected subject (data not shown).
In other experiments, amplified DNA fragments containing exon 7 from hemizygous 46,XY affected subjects and heterozygous 46,XX carrier subjects with the
AR R831 Q and V866M mutations all display the expected pattern of electrophoretic mobility upon DGGE
(data not shown). The two affected 46,XY family members with the R831 Q mutation and three affected 46,XY
siblings with the V866M mutation, each show a single
DNA fragment with altered electrophoretic mobility similar to that shown in Fig. 2 for subjects 5 (AR-) and 4
(AR+), respectively. The two heterozygous 46,XX subjects carrying the R831 Q mutation and the obligate
heterozygous mother of the three siblings with the
V866M mutation, each exhibit four ethidium bromide
stained bands upon DGGE, representing the four combinations of DNA duplex molecules after denaturation/
reannealing of the polymerase chain reaction amplified
products of the sense and antisense strands of the
wild-type and mutant alleles. Taken together, these
results demonstrate a pattern of X-linked inheritance
and provide evidence for a strong association between
the AR gene point mutations and CAIS.

positions 774, 831, and 866 of the human AR mutants presented in this study are shown as an outlined single letter amino acid
code at the appropriate positions.

Construction and Expression of Mutant AR cDNAs

Having demonstrated the association bf AR gene point
mutations with CAIS, we went on to show the effect of
each mutation on the biological function of AR. Complementary DNA fragments containing each of the three
nucleotide base changes from the two AR- and one
AR+ subjects, were ligated into the Hindlll/BamHI sites
of the parent wild-type pCMV expression vector so as
to construct a human AR cDNA with the representative
mutations (Fig. 5). The presence of each nucleotide
base substitution at the appropriate position and the
absence of other base changes was verified by sequencing the complete Hindlll/BamHI fragment from
each plasmid.
The pCMV human AR expression vector containing

the wild-type AR sequence or mutations AR-R774C, R831 Q and -V866M was co-transfected into COS-1
monkey kidney cells along with the plasmid pCH110,
containing the lac Z gene driven by the SV40 promoter.
Transfection efficiency was determined by comparing
AR to ,6-galactosidase activity.
lmmunoblots of human AR protein expression in
transfected COS-1 cells were performed with each of
the five following transfections: mock COS, AR-wt, ARR774C, AR-R831Q, and AR-V866M. For the wild-type
and each of the three mutants, a protein of 110 kDa
reacted specifically with hAR52 antiserum which recognizes an epitope immediately 5' to the DNA binding
domain (Fig. 6).
To determine whether the expressed AR proteins
could bind androgen, COS-1 cells were transfected and

PCR amplified DNA fragments of exon 7 were incubated in

The digested DNA was electrophoresed on a 4% NuSieve
GTG agarose gel with 0X 174-Haelll digested DNA as a
standard. Genomic DNA was from one normal subject (wt)
and four members (A-D) of a pedigree with CAIS, AR- determined to have mutation R831 Q: A, 46,XY subject with CAIS,

sibling of subject B with CAIS, AR-; and D, 46,XX obligate
heterozygous mother of subjects B and C.

incubated with a saturating concentration of 3 H-R1881
(5 nM) for 2 h and assayed for the level of specific
androgen receptor binding activity. In cells transfected
with either AR-wt or AR-V866M, a high level of 3 HR1881 binding is observed (Table 1). However, when
cells are mock-transfected or transfected with ARR?? 4C and AR-R831 Q, specific 3 H-R 1881 binding is
absent. Scatchard analyses of 3 H-R1881 binding in
replicate plates of COS cells transfected with AR-wt
(0.05-1.5 nM 3 H-R1881) or AR-V866M (0.2-5.0 nM 3 HR1881) shows a 6.5-fold lower apparent binding affinity
(Kd) for the mutant receptor (2.46 nM) than for the wildtype receptor (0.38 nM) (Fig. 7). This result is similar to
the difference in binding affinity reported earlier for
cultured genital skin fibroblasts (18) from normal subjects and three affected siblings of this pedigree with
complete AIS, AR+ (AR-V866M) (Table 1). Furthermore, the absence of R1881 binding in COS-1 cells
transfected with AR-R77 4C and AR-R831 Q is not due
to the lack of protein translation nor to a truncated or
significantly unstable AR protein created by any of the
mutations.

tion were studied in CV-1 cells by their ability to induce
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in the
presence of various steroid hormones. The mouse
mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat (MMTVLTR) contains four partial inverted repeats of the sequence, TGTTCT, which function as response elements
for AR, as well as for glucocorticoid and progestin
receptors. Therefore, we cotransfected cells with the
MMTV-LTR-CAT reporter gene, with pCH110 containing the lac Z gene, and with the AR expression vector
constructs. CAT activity is absent in CV-1 cells if steroid
is not added, regardless of the transfection of wild-type
or mutant human ARs (Fig. 8). In the presence of 1O
nM androgen (DHT or R1881), AR-wt or AR-V866M,
both of which bind androgen, significantly induce CAT
activity when expressed in CV-1 cells. By contrast, the
AR- mutants, AR-R774C and AR-R831 Q, are totally
ineffective in stimulating CAT activity when androgen is
added. The addition of 10 nM progesterone or 25 nM

dexamethasone fails to stimulate CAT activity by any
of the expressed AR proteins. AR-wt is, however, able
to induce CAT activity upon the addition of 10 nM
estradiol, whereas none of the mutant AR proteins,
including AR-V866M, is able to stimulate CAT activity
in the presence of estrogen.
When the level of CAT activity is quantified by a twophase partitioning radioactive scintillation assay, distinct differences are observed in the ability of the various
androgen ligands to induce enzyme activity with the
wild-type receptor, AR-wt, and the AR+ mutant, ARV866M (Fig. 9). Using a range of steroid concentrations
from 0.1-10 nM, DHT, R1881, and testosterone cause
a dose-dependent increase in CAT activity. However,
distinct differences are observed between the ability of
AR-wt and AR-V866M to stimulate CAT activity at a
given concentration of DHT, R1881, or testosterone.
At the highest concentration of steroid (10 nM), little
difference is seen between AR-wt and AR-V866M, the
increase being about 100-fold above the baseline level
observed in the absence of steroid. However, at 0.1 nM
DHT or R1881, a major difference in the magnitude of
CAT stimulation by the same two receptor contructs is

The AR is a member of the steroid, thyroid, and retinoic
acid hormone recE;lptor superfamily of proteins that
mediate the action~ of their respective cognate ligands
through the regulation of g(;lne transcription (7-10). The
proteins are modular in nature, comprised of a highly
variable N-terminal domain, thought to function in transcriptional l;lctivation, and well-characterized DNA- and
hormone-binding domains (20, 21 ). The latter regulates,
in unknown fashion, the ability of the DNA-binding
domain of the protein to recognize DNA sequence
elements of responsive genes and modulates the transcription of those genes.
Several pathophysiological conditions in humans result not from a lack of the hormone but rather from an
impairment of the mechanism which activates hormoneresponsive genes. These conditions of hormone insensitivity in humans have been described for thyroid (22),
vitamin D (21), glucocorticoid (24), mineralocorticoid
(25), and androgen (1, 4). In androgen insensitivity,
biochemical studies have shown that the impairment in
hormonal responsiveness correlates with defects in
binding of androgen to its receptor (1, 4, 11, 12, 18).
This study shows that ligand binding and transcriptional
activation are impaired due to naturally occurring mutations in the androgen receptor gene and establishes
the conclusion that AR defects underlie the condition
of CAIS in humans.
The heterogeneous nature of human CAIS became
apparent from studies of AR binding in cultured genital
skin fibroblasts from affected subjects (1 , 11 , 12). In
some cases of CAIS, AR binding was undetectable
(AR-), whereas in others quantitatively normal binding
(AR+) was observed. More recently using cDNA probes
for the human AR gene, we reported that a partial
deletion was responsible tor complete androgen insensitivity in one family (17). While this finding provided an
explanation for the physiological insensitivity and the
absence of AR binding activity in cultured genital skin
fibroblasts from affected members of this family, other
families with absent AR binding had no apparent structural defect in the AR gene (17). In fact, AR gene
transcription also appeared normal on Northern blots
of poly(A+) RNA isolated from cultured genital skin
fibroblasts of six subjects with CAIS, AR-, and one
patient with CAIS, AR+. On this basis, we suggested
that point mutc1tions in the AR gene might be responsible for the expression of androgen insensitivity in
these subjects. Appropriately, we identified a single
nucleotide substitution within the open reading frame
of the gene in the AR+ family who had quantitatively

greater than or equal to 0.95 determined by linear regression analysis. Fold induction of CAT activity over baseline was calculated
from the linear slope of each kinetic reaction curve using the following formula:

normal but qualitatively abnormal AR binding activity
(18). The nucleotide change (G - A) resulted in the
substitution of methionine for valine in amino acid position 866 (19). Although this amino acid substitution
was correlated with CAIS in three affected members of
this family and was transmitted as an X-linked trait,
functional studies of the putative mutant AR were not
obtained.
In this study, we report point mutations in the AR
genes of two unrelated families with CAIS, AR-. Because their receptors did not bind DHT in cultured
genital skin fibroblasts (1), we amplified in each family,
exons 4 to 8 of the AR gene which encode the steroidbinding domain (13). In one family, the point mutation
occurs in exon 7 with a G - A change resulting in an
amino acid substitution of glutamine for arginine at
position 831 (13). Based upon restriction endonuclease
digestion of DNA with BstBI, we showed the X-linked
inheritance of this mutation. In a second family, we
identify within exon 6, a single nucleotide substitution
(C - T) that results in the substitution of a cysteine for
an arginine at amino acid position 77 4 (13). This substitution eliminates a Kpnl restriction endonuclease
cleavage site near the 5' -border of exon 6, a finding
recently reported to occur in three other unrelated
families (26-28). We cloned each of these point mutations into an AR expression vector (13) and transfected
them into COS cells. The presence of the expressed
proteins was verified by immunoblotting with an AR

specific antiserum (13). The fact that both proteins are
unable to bind R1881 with high affinity or to transactivate the MMTV-CAT reporter gene in an in vitro transfection assay for biological function, provides definitive
proof linking these single amino acid substitutions with
the condition of CAIS.
A multifunctional role in hormone action has been
proposed for the steroid binding domain. In addition to
the well-documented role of this C-terminal domain in
steroid binding, it also functions in transcriptional activation and receptor dimerization (29-37). Our results
demonstrate that a single amino acid substitution within
the steroid binding domain from a basic residue, arginine, at positions 774 or 831, to a polar amino acid like
cysteine or to glutamine, respectively, can eliminate the
hormone binding capacity of the protein. The normal
function of the steroid is to bind AR and to release the
inhibitory influence of the unoccupied receptor on transcription activation; a biological activity that is defective
in mutants R774 and R831 Q. Therefore, these naturally
occurring inactive mutant ARs are differentiated from
the genetically engineered AR deletion mutants of the
steroid binding domain which are constitutive activators
of transcription (38).
Interestingly, the mutations in AR, R774C, and
R831 Q, occur in arginine residues that are not contained within blocks of conserved amino acid homology
among the various steroid receptors shown in Fig. 3.
However, the wild-type AR amino acid residue arginine

AR Functional Defect in AIS

is conserved among the most highly homologous neighbors of the human AR, namely glycocorticoid receptor
(GR) and progesterone receptor (PR) (Fig. 3). The fact
that the wild-type arginine residues at positions 774
and 831 are neither unique nor completely conserved
among all steroid receptors suggests that they do not
directly contact the steroid molecule. Instead, the lack
of steroid binding and consequent lack of transcription
activation in these mutants is likely to be the result of
an altered conformation in the AR protein that prevents
hormone binding, and thus transcription activation, but
does not significantly influence its turnover as shown
by immunoblotting. Interestingly, a human AR cDNA
clone isolated from a human testis cDNA library contains four amino acid substitutions in the region immediately adjacent to R831 Q (39). This sequence alteration results in an AR protein which does not bind steroid
with high affinity and also fails to activate gene transcription in vitro.
Although many cases of CAIS result from the absence of ligand binding by AR, relatively fewer cases
are characterized by quantitatively normal but qualitatively abnormal androgen binding activity (1 , 4, 18). The
mutation V866M (valine - methionine) represents such
a case, where a normal to elevated number of ARs
were measured in cultured genital skin fibroblasts but
the apparent binding affinity for DHT was decreased by
severalfold (18). Expression of this mutant in the AR
expression vector resulted in an AR protein with over
6-fold reduced affinity for binding of R1881 . When the
mutant AR cDNA expression vector was cotransfected
with the MMTV-CAT reporter gene, a dose-dependent
androgen stimulation of CAT activity by R1881 or DHT
was observed. At physiological steroid concentrations
of 0.1 nM, the mutant AR-V866M stimulated CAT activity only minimally, much less than AR-wt. At high concentrations of steroid (1 O nM), mutant AR-V866M stimulated gene transcription in vitro, an effect that would
not occur in vivo at physiological concentrations of free
androgen available to the target cells. The relatively low
induction of CAT activity by mutant AR-V866M was
steroid concentration dependent and the potency of
effect followed the relative binding affinities for R1881
> DHT > testosterone to AR (40). Interestingly, the
V866M and wild-type AR are also distinguished by the
induction of CAT activity by estradiol. AR-wt stimulates
CAT activity in the presence of 10 nM estradiol but
V866M does not, suggesting that sufficiently high concentrations of estradiol may actually activate gene transcription by binding to the wild-type AR (41, 42).
The mechanism by which the point mutation V866M
results in only a modest change in steroid binding
properties of the AR but causes total loss of in vivo AR
functional activity is not yet clear. It appears that complete transformation of the receptor subsequent to
steroid binding requires precise structural interaction
between receptor and ligand (37). Steroid antagonists,
for example, have recently been shown to bind estrogen
receptor (ER) and GR and promote specific binding to
hormone response elements without enhancing gene

1767

transcription as would a normal agonist. Hormone binding domains of ,nuclear receptors are now recognized
to have transcription activation function (31, 33-37).
Ligand binding to AR and other steroid hormone receptors initiates a transformation process that results in
enhanced binding of receptors to their hormone response elements (29-32). This process may involve a
conformational change in the receptor protein or separation from a nonsteroid-binding component that unmasks the DNA-binding domain and a nuclear transfer
sequence located in the C-terminal region downstream
from the DNA-binding domain. The process may also
activate within the steroid binding domain, a dimerization sequence shown to be required for strong interaction of the steroid receptor with its response element
and for transactivation of gene expression (34-36).
Recently, Parker and co-workers (33, 34) have shown
that a C-terminal region, which includes the mutation
at amino acid 866, contains hydrophobic residues arranged in a heptad and conserved in all nuclear receptors. In vitro mutations in this region in the mouse ER
blocked receptor dimerization, decreased DNA binding
affinity and eliminated steroid binding. Thus, V866M
may be defective in any one of a number of regulatory
steps involved in steroid hormone action.
Whereas the decreased but not absolute absence of
biological function of AR mutant V866M may not appear
to be consistent with the phenotype of complete AIS,
one must take into account several additional factors
such as: 1) whether the concentration of endogenous
androgen in the developing fetus is sufficient to induce
androgen-dependent musculinization if the AR mutation
is present; 2) whether the presence of the mutation
interfers in some way with the actions of other factors
involved in androgen-stimulated gene transcription; and
3) whether the hormone response element within the
MMTV-LTR promoter, which is promiscuous in the
presence of AR, GR, or PR, is an accurate androgen
response element to determine the specificity of androgen action (41-46).
Whereas the direct action of testosterone or its more
potent 5a-reduced metabolite, DHT, on transcription
involves multiple nuclear proteins, the specificity of
transcriptional activation by androgens most probably
lies in the AR itself. Thus, it is not surprising that
insensitivity to androgens arises from mutations in the
AR, analogous to those recently shown to be responsible for vitamin D (47-49) and thyroid (50) resistant
states. In this study, point mutations in the human AR
gene steroid-binding domain have been definitively associated with functional defects in the AR proteins from
human subjects with AIS. Whereas complete insensitivity to androgen is readily apparent in 46,XY subjects
with a completely female phenotype as seen in this
study, it is likely that other mutations within the AR
gene lead to partial insensitivity with ambiguity of the
external genitalia (1) and possibly even less severely
affected phenotypes as in phenotypic men with azoospermia (2, 3). Finally, the occurrence of AIS might
also arise from changes in other elements of the andro-

human AR cDNA sequence. We then subcloned a 1206-bp
human AR cDNA fragment by insertion at its natural 5' -Hindi II
site (nucleotide 2829) and ligated it to the BamHI site (nucleotide 4066) within the 3' -polylinker region of the vector, thus
retaining unique internal Hindlll and EcoRI sites within the AR
cDNA and an external 3' -BamHI site, these sites being convenient for subsequent subcloning of cDNA fragments containing specific point mutations in the human AR. We termed
this new expression vector, p5HEBhAR-1. Preparation of
these mutant ARs is described below and in Fig. 5.

Experimental Subjects

RNA Preparation, Northern Blots, and cDNA Synthesis

Informed written consent for genital skin biopsy or blood
sample was obtained from each individual according to protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins Joint Committee for
Clinical Investigation. Each affected subject with CAIS had a
normal 46,XY karyotype with normal female external genitalia
and absence of uterus and fallopian tubes. A short vagina
ended in a blind vaginal pouch. Bilateral testes were located
in the abdomen or in the labia majora but there were little or
no Wolffian duct derivatives. Breast development occurred
spontaneously at puberty and there was sparse to absent
pubic and axillary hair despite blood testosterone concentrations in the normal adult male range. Androgen receptor binding assays in cultured human genital skin fibroblasts have
been reported previously for all subjects included in this study
(1, 11, 12, 18).

Total RNA was prepared from human genital skin fibroblasts
by solubilization in 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate and centrifugation through a 5.7 M cesium chloride cushion, estraction
with phenol and chloroform, and repeated precipitation with
ethanol in the presence of potassium acetate (57). The poly(A+)
RNA fraction was obtained by passing the crude RNA over
two successive oligo-dT columns and ethanol precipitation
(58).
For Northern blot analyses (59), 2-3 µg poly(A+) RNA was
electrophoresed on a 1% agarose-1 .13% formaldehyde gel in
20 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mM sodium acetate, and 1 mM EDTA
at 5 V/cm, transferred to nitrocellulose overnight in 20x SSC,
and baked at 80 C for 2 h. The filter was wet briefly in deionized
formamide and prehybridized at 42 C in a solution of 25 mM
KP04 , pH 7.4, 5X SSC, 5X Denhart's, 50 µg/ml yeast tRNA,
50% formamide, and 10% dextran sulfate. Hybridization of
RNA to human AR or chicken ~-actin cDNA probes was
performed in the presence of 2-4 x 106 cpm random-primed
32P-labeled probe/ml hybridization solution at 42 C. The filters
were washed twice for 15 min in 1x SSC/0.1% sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at room temperature and twice for 15
min in 0.25X SSC/0.1 % SDS at room temperature and exposed to Kodak XOMAT film at -70 C with an intensifying
screen.
Poly (N) RNA (1 µg) was used to prepare single-stranded
cDNA (60) with random hexamer priming following the protocol
supplied with the Amersham cDNA Synthesis System Plus
(Arlington Heights, IL). The 20-µI reaction volume was diluted
25-fold in TE, pH 7.5, and stored at 4 C. An aliquot of the
cDNA pool (1 µI) was amplified by the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) using 25 pmol each human AR cDNA oligonucleotide primer designed to overlap the Hindlll and BamHI
restriction sites (AR3 and AR6 of Fig. 4) in a 50 µI total reaction
volume containing 200 µM each dNTP in reaction buffer (1 O
mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.01%
gelatin). The reaction mixture was denatured at 94 C for 5 min
and cooled to 72 C. Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer/
Cetus, Emeryville, CA) (2.5 U) was added and a first cycle of
amplification (94 C, 1 min; 56 C, 2 min; 72 C, 40 min) was
followed by additional cycles of amplification (94 C, 40 sec; 56
C, 2 min; 72 C, 3 min) and a final extension at 72 C for 15
min.
The amplified product was digested with Hindlll and BeymHI
and purified on a 4% NuSieve GTG agarose (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) gel. The purified 1.2 kb AR cDNA fragment was ligated directly from the melted agarose into the
Hindlll/BamHI sites of the p5HEBhAR-1 expression vector for
transfection into competent HB101 cells. Colonies containing
plasmid DNA were selected for growth on LB-ampicillin (200
µg/ml) agar plates. Five to 10 colonies were selected, inoculated into 5 ml liquid cultures of LB containing 50 µg/ml
ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 C. Plasmid DNA was
prepared by a modification of the alkaline miniprep method
described by Maniatis et al. (61).
For sequencing of double-stranded plasmid DNA, 2-3 µg
purified DNA were denatured in 0.2 N NaOH at room temperature for 5 min and precipitated in the presence of 1 .5 M
ammonium acetate by addition of ethanol at -80 C for 15 min.
The DNA was collected by centrifugation, washed with 70%
ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 7 µI water. The DNA was

gen-inducible transcription pathway, either in specific
transcriptional factors (51, 52) or in the important target
genes themselves. Presumably, each might have a
unique clinical presentation that is not currently appreciated.

Cell Culture

Human genital skin fibroblasts were propagated in tissue
culture from explants of normal male foreskin (46,XY control
subjects) or a biopsy specimen from the labia major of 46,XY
subjects with CAIS. Genital skin fibroblasts as well as CV-1
and COS-1 monkey kidney cells for DNA transfection experiments were maintained in minimal essential minimum (MEM)
with Earle's salts and supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100
U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin and 10% fetal
bovine serum.
AR Binding Assay

AR binding activity was determined in replicate culture dishes
of DNA-transfected COS-1 cells by the procedure described
previously for cultured human genital skin fibroblasts (40). For
total AR binding, cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 C in the
presence of 5 nM 3H-R1881 (87 Ci/mmol; methyltrienolone;
New England Nuclear, Wilmington, DE) in MEM. For Scatchard
analyses (53), COS-1 cells were incubated in an identical
manner with a range of 3H-R1881 concentrations from 0.055.0 nM. The level of specific radiolabeled steroid binding was
normalized for DNA content as measured by the method of
Burton (54) and corrected for efficiency of DNA transfection
according to the ~-galactosidase activity (55) in replicate plates
'
of cells.
Construction of Human AR Expression Vector

The full-length coding sequence of the human AR contained
within a 3.1 kb Bg/11-BspHI (blunt) cDNA insert was cloned into
the pCMV5 parent vector (56) at the Bg/11-Hindlll (blunt) sites
(13). The complete human AR expression vector, termed
p5HBhAR-A, contains the immediate early promoter region of
the human cytomegalovirus promoter, human GH transcription
termination and polyadenylation signal, the SV40 origin of DNA
replication and early region enhancer sequences, the bacteriophage Fl origin of replication, an Escherichia coli gene encoding ampicillin resistance and a polylinker region (56). The
p5HBhAR-A vector was subsequently modified to eliminate
the EcoRI site (nucleotide 911) in the 5' -polylinker region thus
retaining a now unique EcoRI site (nucleotide 3542) within the

initially sequenced following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer of the Sequenase kit (United States Biochemicals,
Cleveland, OH) using human AR cDNA specific oligonucleotide
primers (Fig. 5) to verify the presence in each selected plasmid
of the altered base pair for the three affected human subjects.
After identification of appropriate plasmid containing colonies,
the entire Hindlll-BamHI human AR cDNA insert region was
sequenced to eliminate the possibility that PCR induced nucleotide errors might be contained in the expression vector
AR cDNA insert sequence or that more than one mutation
might be contained within the AR gene of subjects with CAIS.
Density Gradient Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis

Genomic DNA was prepared from cultured genital skin fibroblasts or blood leukocytes, as previously described (17). DNA
(500 ng) was amplified by PCR as performed by Lubahn et al.
(19) except that oligonucleotide primers for exons 4-8 were
used at a final concentration of 1 µM and each 5' -oligonucleotide primer contained a 40-bp G-C clamp (5' GCCGCCCGCC
GCCGCCCGCC GCCGCCGCCC GCCGCCCGCC 3') before
the human AR specific 5' -primer sequence (62). Amplification
conditions consisted of an initial denaturing step at 94 C for 5
min before addition of 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase followed by
one cycle of 94 C, 2 min; 56-60 C, 2 min; and 72 C, 6 min;
and 30 cycles of 94 C, 1 min; 56-60, 2 min; and 72 C, 3 min;
with a final extension step at 72 C for 1O min. DNA products
of the correct size were verified by electrophoresis on a 2%
agarose gel at 100 V for 4 h.
Amplified DNA fragments (10-µI reaction aliquot) were electrophoresed on a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel in T AE buffer with
a 20-80% denaturant gradient (100% denaturant is 40%
formamide/7 M urea) (62-64). Electrophoresis was carried out
using a system designed by Green Mountain Lab Supply
(Waltham, MA) with a 60 C recirculating TAE buffer bath for a
total of 1300 V, h. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide
and photographed under UV light to determine the relative
mobility of each DNA fragment.
In cases where exon-specific amplified DNA fragments from
subjects with CAIS exhibited differential mobility on DGGE as
compared to wild-type DNA fragments, the genomic DNA was
reamplified by the PCR reaction but without the 40-bp G-C
clamp oligonucleotide primer. Amplified DNA products were
separated from oligonucleotide primers by centrifugation
through a Centricon 30 microfiltration unit and directly sequenced (65, 66) with T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase, United
States Biochemicals). Sequencing primers, the same as those
used for the amplification reactions, were end-labeled with 'Y32P ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; New England Nuclear) using T. DNA
polynucleotide kinase (Bethesda Research Laboratories,
Gaithersburg, MD). Approximately 80 ng PCR product were
annealed with 10 ng appropriate 32 P-labeled sequencing primer
in a volume of 11 µI on ice for 1O min. After heat denaturing
for 5 min at 95 C, 2.5 µI annealed sample were added to four
tubes with 3 µI sequencing mixture containing nonradioactive
dNTPs at a concentration of 64 µl'yl, ddNTPs at a concentration
of 6.2 µM and 2 U T7 DNA polymerase in buffer (25 mM TrisHCI, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgC'2, 70 mM NaCl, and 7 mM dithiothreitol). The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 C followed
by the addition of 3 µI stop solution (95% formamide, 20 mM
EDTA, 0.05% bromophenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol
FF). Samples were boiled for 3 min before loading 3 µI onto a
7% polyacrylamide/8 M urea gel. After electrophoresis at 60
W for 2-2.5 h, gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XOMAT
film for 16 h at -70 C with an intensifying screen. Each
sequence was verified by sequencing both the sense and
antisense strands from two independent amplification reactions for each subject with AIS.
Transient DNA Transfection

On the day before transfection, CV-1 or COS-1 monkey kidney
cells were transferred to 1 00-mm culture dishes at a density

of 1 x 106 cells per dish. Two to 4 h before DNA transfection,
5 ml fresh MEM c,ontaining 20% charcoal-treated fetal bovine
serum were added to each culture dish. Cells were transfected
with 30 µg total plasmid DNA consisting of 10 µg pCH11 O (gift
from M. West, Johns Hopkins University), 10 µg MMTV-CAT
(gift from L. Sanders, Johns Hopkins University), and 10 µg
human wt or mutant AR in p5HEBhAR-1 or 10 µg control
vector in 0.5 ml HBS (19 mM HEPES, pH 7.05, 0.14 M NaCl,
5 mM KCI, 0.7 mM Na2HPO., and 5.5 mM glucose) and 0.125
M CaC'2 by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method
(67). Cells were incubated in the presence of DNA for 4 h at
37 C after which the medium was removed. The cells were
washed twice with 5 ml serum-free MEM, incubated for 1 min
in HBS containing 15% glycerol (COS~ 1 cells) or 20% glycerol
(CV-1 cells) and rinsed with 1 x HBS. Cells were incubated
overnight in MEM supplemented with 5% charcoal-treated
fetal bovine serum. The next day, transfected cells from each
group were detached from plates in PBS (0.15 M NaCl, 1 .15
mM KH2PO., 4.3 mM Na2HP04, 2.7 mM KCl)-EDTA (0.53 mM)trpysin (0.05%) and suspended in MEM-5% charcoal treated
FBS and passaged to 100-mm culture dishes. These replicate
culture dishes were incubated for 4 h at 37 C to allow cells to
attach to the dishes before the addition of steroids in ethanol
(<0.1%) to the medium.
lmmunoblotting

COS-1 cells transiently transfected with the human AR cDNA
expression vector were washed three times on ice with 5 ml
PBS. Cells were directly solubilized by the addition of 300 µI
hot (95 C) 2x electrophoresis sample buffer (0.125 M Tris-HCI,
pH 6.8, 4% SOS, 20% glycerol, 1.4 M 2-mercaptoethanol).
The viscosity of this cell lysate was reduced by the addition of
0.1 µg each of DNase and RNase. Samples were stored frozen
at - 70 C until use.
Electrophoresis was carried out in 7 .5% polyacrylamide gels
containing 3.5 mM SOS according to the method of Laemmli
(68), using a vertical polyacrylamide gel (1.5 mm thick, 14 cm
wide, and 12.5 cm long) with a 1 cm stacking gel. Samples
were boiled for 5 min before application of 50- to 75-µI aliquots
in gels. Proteins were transferred from polyacrylamide gels to
nitrocellulose membrane filters by electrophoresis at 500 mA
in 2.5 mM Tris, 0.19 M glycine at room temperature for 1.5 h.
Nitrocellulose filters were preincubated (30 min) in 0.01 M
Na2HPO., pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 containing
20 µg/ml SSA before incubation for 1 h with the affinity purified
anti-peptide antibody (AR1-52) diluted 1:250 (11 µg/ml) in 0.01
M Na2HP04, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 (13).
Filters were washed several times with buffer in the absence
of additional protein and then incubated with buffer containing
20 µg/ml BSA and 1 µCi 1251-labeled protein A (8.29 µCifµg;
New England Nuclear) for 1 h. Finally, the filter was washed
with several changes of protein-free buffer. The washed filters
were exposed to Kodak XOMAT film for 40-64 h at -70 C
with an intensifying screen.
Enzyme Assays

Cells transfected with plasmid DNA were washed three times
with 5 ml ice-cold PBS and scraped on ice into 1 ml 0.04 M
Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.15 M NaCl. Cells were
collected by centrifugation (4 C, 2 min) in a microfuge and
stored frozen at -70 C or immediately resuspended in 150 µI
0.25 M Tris-HCI, pH 7.8. The cell suspension was subjected
to three cycles of freeze-thawing in dry-ice/ethanol for 5 min
and 37 C for 5 min. The cell debris was pelleted in a microfuge
(4 C, 5 min) and the supernatant was transferred to a new
tube. The cellular extract was frozen at - 70 C and used for
assay of t1-galactosidase or CAT activities.
For t1-galactosidase (54), 30 µI cell extract were mixed with
1 ml reaction buffer (60 mM Na2PO.f40 mM NaH2PO., 1O mM
KCI, 1 mM MgSO., 0.05 M t1-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0), and
0.2 ml substrate (2 mg/ml O-nitro-t1-o-galactopyranoside in 60

mM Na2 P0 4/40 mM NaH 2 P04). The reaction was allowed to
proceed at 37 C until a faint yellow color was observed (1 h
or less for COS-1 cells and 2-3 h for CV-1 cells). The reaction
was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml 1 M Na 2 C0 3 and the
difference between the absorbance peak at 420 nm and the
baseline at 550 nm was recorded. The 1J-galactosidase activity
was used as a measure of DNA transfection efficiency and to
normalize CAT and AR binding activities between culture
dishes and treatment groups.
For CAT activity, two separate assays were used. The first
assay used 14C-chloramphenicol (dichloroacetyl-1,2-14C; 58.2
mCi/mmol; New England Nuclear) as substrate and resolved
the acetylated 14-C products by TLC and subsequent autoradiography (69). The second assay used 3 H-acetyl coenzyme
A (acetyl-3 H; 2.5 Cijmmol; New England Nuclear) as the cofactor for acetylation of chloramphenicol in a two-phase partition
liquid scintillation spectrophotometric method (70). In the former assay, 30 µI cell extract were combined with 0.1 µCi (1.7
µmol) 14 C-chloramphenicol, 0.5 M Tris-HCI, pH 7.8, and 0.53
mM acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) in a total volume of 150 µI and
incubated at 37 C for 3 h. The reaction mixture was extracted
with 500 µI ethyl acetate. A 400-µI aliquot of the organic phase
was dried, resuspended, and chromatographed on silica gel
thin-layer plates in CHCl 3 :methanol (90:10). The chromatogram
was exposed to Kodak XOMAT film overnight at room temperature to visualize the acetylated products.
For the quantitative assay of CAT activity by scintillation
spectrophotometry, 30 µI cell extract were mixed in a scintillation counting vial with 1.25 mM chloramphenicol, 0.1 M TrisHCI, pH 7.8, and 0.1 µCi (40 pmol) 3 H-acetyl CoA in a total
volume of 0.2 ml. The reaction mixture was overlaid with a 5
ml Betafluor (National Diagnostics, Sommerville, NJ) and
placed into a scintillation spectrophotometer set for 0.5 min/
sample and automatic recycling for 6-10 cycles. The linear
rate of CAT enzymatic activity was detected as the diffusion
of 3 H-acetylated chloramphenicol into the organic scintillation
cocktail. All samples generated a linear curve of enzymatic
activity (r > 0.95) in this assay for at least 3 h (i.e. six or more
counting cycles).
