Four
amino

were
identified
in the study: Arg for G~Y~~*, Cys for Arg470,
Leu for Pro17*6, and Cys for G1y206’. Of 45 families
tested, a single family presented
the Arg for Glyz4’ substitution
where it segregated
with malignant
hyperthermia, making
it a candidate

for predisposition
to MH in man. The other three polymorphic

INTRODUCTION

Malignant
hyperthermia
(MH) is a dominantly
inherited predisposition
to uncontrolled
muscle contracture and accompanying
hypercatabolic
reactions, triggered in man by inhalational
anesthetics such as haiothane and muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine.
Halothane
sensitivity commonly occurs in swine, al-

though the condition in homozygously affected pigs may
be triggered by stress as well as by anesthesia (Britt,
1991; O’Brien, 1987; Nelson, 1988; Harrison, 1988). A
malignant hyperthermia
crisis is potentially
fatal, with
multiple complications.
The fact that Ca”+ plays an essential role in muscle
contraction
would associate defective Cazf release or
Ca2+ reuptake with muscle contracture, as well as with
the hypermetabolic
activities of the contracted muscle
(Brostrom et al., 1971). No evidence for a defect in the
Ca2+ pump, which removes Ca2+ from muscle, has yet
been obtained (Nelson, 1988). MH episodes may be
averted by early intervention
with the drug dantrolene
(Steward and O’Connor, 1987), known to prevent calcium release into the muscle, either directly or by dissociating early steps in the excitation-contraction
coupling process (Harrison,
1988). These observations
point to the calcium release channel of skeletal muscle,
spanning the gap between the functional face of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the transverse tubules (Lai and
Meissner, 1989), as a potential site for defects causative
of MH. Because this channel binds and is modulated by
the plant alkaloid ryanodine, it is also referred to as the
ryanodine receptor.
Further evidence associating defects in the skeletal
muscle ryanodine receptor (RYRl) gene with MH susceptibility includes tissue-specific expression of the gene
in fast- and slow-twitch
skeletal muscle (Otsu et al.,
1990), the tissue most affected by the MH reaction. In
swine the MH phenotype is accompanied by alterations
in the tryptic digestion pattern of the ryanodine receptor
(Knudson et al., 1990), alterations in the Ca2+ dependence of ryanodine binding (Mickelson et al., 1988), and
facilitation of channel opening and inhibition of channel
closing (Ohnishi et al., 1983; Fill et al., 1990).
Genetic studies also support RYRl as a candidate
gene for MH in both humans and pigs. In humans the
RYRl gene is localized to chromosome 19q13.1 (MacKenzie et al., 1990), while in pigs it is localized to a ho0888-7543/92

mologous region on chromosome 6 (Harbitz et al., 1990).
In both swine (Archibald and Imlah, 1985) and humans
(McCarthy
et aZ., 1990) genetic markers close to the
RYRl gene were found to segregate with the MH phenotype. In studies of the RYRl gene itself (MacLennan
et
al., 1990), cosegregation of intragenic polymorphisms
with the MH phenotype was found in nine human families.
In studies of the pig, we discovered that the alteration
of c1843to T in the porcine RYRl gene, leading to substitution of Cys for Arg615, segregated with the MH phenotype in over 450 animals, including 338 informative
meioses, strongly implicating this genetic alteration as
causative of halothane sensitivity (Fujii et al., 1991; Otsu
et al., 1991). We also found that the corresponding mutation occurs across a species barrier in humans where it
was linked to MH in a single family (Gillard et al., 1991).
Despite this powerful evidence for a causative role for
the RYRl gene in porcine and human MH, there is evidence for genetic heterogeneity, since lack of linkage between RYRl polymorphisms
and MH has now been observed in a number of families (Levitt et al., 1991; Deufel
et al., 1992).
To define additional candidate MH mutations in the
RYRl gene and to detect additional polymorphisms
that
will be useful for further linkage studies, we undertook
systematic sequencing of RYRl cDNA obtained from
muscle mRNA from three individuals predisposed to
MH. We identified 21 sequence variations in the three
patients, 13 of which resulted in loss or gain of a useful
restriction
enzyme site. These restriction
fragment
length polymorphisms
(RFLPs) were then utilized for
linkage analysis in our MH families. Four of the 21 sequence variants observed resulted in amino acid substitutions. One of these, an Arg for G1yz4’ substitution,
segregated with MH, making it a candidate mutation potentially causative of MH.

METHODS

and cDNA

Genomic
DNA was isolated
from blood of MH-sensitive
(MHS)
and
normal
(MHN)
individuals
(Miller
et al., 1988). RNA was prepared
(Chomczynski
and Sacchi,
1987) from muscle biopsy samples
of three
MHS individuals,
HJ, TJ, and BT, and subsequent
cDNA
preparation
used random
hexamers
in a modification
of the method
of Wang et al.
(1989),
as described
in Bulman
et al. (1991).
Amplification
of the
cDNA
(2-3 ~1) from approximately
0.5 mg total mRNA
by the polymerase chain reaction
(Saiki et al., 1988) was followed
either by direct
sequencing
or by subcloning
and sequencing.
Amplification
for restriction endonuclease
analysis
utilized
200-500
ng of genomic
DNA. Each
reaction
was performed
with 100 ng of each primer
and 1.5 units of
7’uq polymerase
in a DNA thermal
cycler (Perkin-Elmer/Cetus)
using
the buffer described
by Kogan et al. (1987). Conditions
for amplification of either
first-strand
cDNA
or genomic
DNA
for most of the
primer pairs involved
denaturation
at 94°C for 30 s, annealing
at 58°C
for 90 s, extension
at 72’C for 150 s, for 35 cycles (with ramp times of
30 s), and then a ‘I-min extension
at 72°C before returning
the sample
to 4°C. Conditions
for amplification
of primer
pairs PI/P2,
P3/P4,
and P7/P8 involved

Sequencing of PCR Products
The

PCR

to Heery et
HJ and BT as
described
by Winship
(1989),
and cloning
of the PCR product
and
sequencing
of multiple
clones were carried
out for patient
TJ. The
detection
efficiency
for the mutant
allele should be close to 100% for
either strategy
as long as the transcript
from the mutant
allele is represented equally with that from the normal
allele in the total mRNA
of
the patient
muscle.
For direct
sequencing
of PCR products,
PCR primers
were chosen
at intervals
of approximately
550 bp along the cDNA
to give 28 overlapping
segments
with about 50 bp of overlap
at each end. In practice,
for the direct
sequencing
approach,
it was found that sequence
near
the primers
was difficult
to obtain so that gaps in the data remain
at
several
of the overlap
regions.
The sequence
is 90% complete
for BT
and 93% complete
for HJ.
For cloning
and sequencing
of DNA from patient
TJ, PCR products
were purified
from polyacrylamide
gels, and the DNA was then endfilled using the Klenow
fragment,
digested
with XbaI, and cloned into
the XbaI site of the Bluescript
vector
(Stratagene).
Sequence
analysis
(Sanger
et al., 1977) utilized
the T7 sequencing
kit (Pharmacia).
Whenever
possible,
eight clones were sequenced,
since this number
gives a 99.6% probability
that the mutant
allele will be present
in at
least one clone and a 96% probability
of being represented
more than
once. For 15% of the PCR products,
only five to seven clones were
available
for analysis
(detection
probability
of 81-94%)
such that the
overall
detection
efhciency
is estimated
to be 95%. Sequence
variations were considered
significant
only if present
in more than one
clone, since PCR artifacts
are only rarely repeated
in multiple
clones.

Analysis of Four Anino

Characterization

The three individuals
chosen for this study had been referred
to the
Malignant
Hyperthermia
Unit of the Toronto
General
Hospital
for
assessment
of MH susceptibility.
Halothane,
caffeine,
and halothane
plus caffeine
contracture
tests were carried
out on muscle biopsies
of
these individuals
and some family
members.
Contractures
resulting
in
less than 0.3 g tension
in 1% halothane
indicate
normality
(N) and
those greater than 0.3 g tension
indicate
susceptibility
(H). Recorded
doses of caffeine
(CSC) are those required
to raise the resting
muscle
tension
by 1 g. Doses of greater
than 4 mM indicate
normality,
while
doses lower than 4 mM indicate
susceptibility
(C). In the presence
of
1% halothane
doses of caffeine
(HCSC)
greater
than 0.5 mM indicate
normality,
doses of less than 0.35 mA4 indicate
susceptibility
(K), and
those between
0.35 and 0.5 mMcaffeine
are considered
indeterminate.
BT case history.
BT was an 18-year-old
male of mixed German
and Phillipino
(Chinese)
parentage,
who at the age of 18 underwent
extraction
of wisdom
teeth under succinylcholine
and halothane.
The
halothane
was switched
to enflurane
part way through
the procedure.
He developed
generalized
muscle rigidity
and arrhythmia.
Postoperatively, he complained
of severe bilateral
chest pain that radiated
to the
back of his neck. His creatine
kinase
rose to 5500 IU. A junctional
rhythm
appeared
on the EKG.
A skeletal
muscle
biopsy
was performed
subsequently,
the results
of which
are listed in Table 2. No
family
members
have had reactions.
HJ case history.
HJ fractured
his left femur in a car accident
and
during
the resulting
surgery
succinylcholine
and halothane
were administered.
This
resulted
in premature
ventricular
contraction,
sweating,
and a fever of 38.5”C.
Blood gas levels were measured
at P,
0, of 70 mm Hg and Pa CO* of 72 mm Hg. The pH was 7.145 and the
base deficit
was -7.5 meq/liter.
These signs were reversed
with dantrolene,
sodium
bicarbonate,
propranolol,
and cooling.
The creatine
kinase
level measured
in postoperative
intensive
care was 4410 IU.
Skeletal
muscle biopsy
results are listed in Table 2.

TJ case history.
While undergoing
a tonsillectomy,
patient
TJ was
administered
succinylcholine
and halothane.
Muscle
rigidity,
increased
respiratory
and heart rates, and a fever of 37.8”C
resulted.
Blood gas levels with hyperventilation
were measured
at Pa 0, of 65.6
mm Hg and Pa CO, of 53.2 mm Hg. The pH was 7.23 and the base
deficit was -6.4 meq/liter.
Successful
treatment
included
40 mg dantrolene
and cooling.
The creatine
kinase level was measured
at 712 IU.
Skeletal
muscle
biopsy
results
are listed in Table 2. The patient
was
known
to suffer from muscle
cramps.

RESULTS
PCR Sequence Analysis of cDNA
To obtain the 15.3-kb RYRl gene coding sequence
from three MHS individuals, mRNA was isolated from
muscle from each patient and first-strand
cDNA was
subjected to PCR amplification.
The overall probability
of detecting any sequence variant present in 50% of the
mRNA was estimated to be >95%, as discussed under
Materials and Methods. Twenty-one
sequence variations identified in the course of this study are presented
in Table 1. To eliminate PCR artifacts, only those variants detected or confirmed by direct sequencing are

HYPERTHERMIA

Acid Substitutions

The four amino acid substitutions were all observed in
TJ. To determine the significance of these alterations in
relation to MH, DNA from MH family members was
studied for the presence or absence of the putative mutations. For three substitutions,
DNA was analyzed by
PCR amplification
followed by restriction endonuclease
digestion and polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis,
since
in all three cases a restriction site had been lost or gained
(Table 1). In the case of the Arg for G1y248substitution,
for which there was no altered restriction site, all DNA
samples were examined by PCR amplification,
followed
by direct sequencing.
The substitution of Arg for G1y248was observed in only
one of the the 45 families tested-family
39 (Fig. 1). The
substitution
was observed in the proband,
TJ, her
brother, SJ, and her mother, CJ. TJ and SJ are both
considered to be MHS on the basis of halothane and
caffeine contracture tests (Table 2). They share a maternal, but not a paternal, haplotype based on other informative RYRl RFLPs (Fig. 2). Unfortunately,
because
the mother of TJ and SJ has not been biopsied and repeated efforts to obtain a biopsy from her have failed,
her MH status is unknown. These results would be consistent with inheritance of R YRl as an MHS gene from
the mother, since she has the amino acid substitution
associated with MH in her two children. The corresponding nucleotide substitution
is, therefore, a candidate mutation for predisposition
to MH.
The substitution of Cys for Arg470 results in the loss of
a HinPI (or HhaI) site. This substitution
was observed
only in family 39, the family of TJ (lanes 7-11, Fig. 2).
The Cys for Arg470 substitution
was seen in TJ and her
father but was not observed in her brother or mother. Its
segregation is thus consistent with an amino acid polymorphism rather than a candidate mutation.
The substitution of Leu for Pro’785 is associated with
the loss of a PuuII site. Leu for Pro’785 also failed to
segregate with MH in the family of TJ, since it was inherited from her father and was not observed in her
brother (Fig. 3). This substitution was also observed in
family 10, where it was present only in the normal parent and was not seen in a child whose identical twin died
from an MH reaction, nor was it found in his MHS father. Thus, this substitution is consistent with an amino
acid polymorphism
rather than a candidate mutation.
The Cys for G1y205gsubstitution is associated with the
gain of a DraIII site (Fig. 4). Patient TJ is homozygous
for this substitution
and the same substitution was also
observed in two other families. In none of these families
was it associated with predisposition
to MH. This sub-

The 14 single base changes that result in the loss or
gain of a restriction endonuclease site are listed in Table
1. To evaluate these RFLPs for family studies, oligonu-

cleotide primers were designed for PCR amplification
of
the region surrounding
each sequence variant. The
primer names are listed in Table 1 and their full sequences are provided under Materials and Methods.
Primers were not designed for the Pro3”j” sequence
change since this PuuII polymorphism
had already been
detected by conventional
Southern blot analysis and

individuals selected from MH families. The three most
useful RFLPs are the AZwNI polymorphism
at Let?,
the TuqI polymorphism
at Ile1151, and the HinPI polymorphism at Serzs6’, with heterozygote frequencies of
0.4-0.5.

DISCUSSION
Malignant

is a complex phenotype expressed in humans in response to a challenge with certain anesthetics. Once an individual has been labeled
MH-sensitive by virtue of an MH reaction, other family
members are often tested for susceptibility to halothaneor caffeine- induced contractures
in muscle biopsies.
These invasive tests are known for their difficulty in

both execution and interpretation,
undoubtedly
resulting in some cases of misdiagnosis.
The development of genetic tests for MH requires that
the gene and the mutations causing MH be identified
unequivocally.
The identification
of the ryanodine receptor gene and its linkage to the MH phenotype in family studies (MacLennan
et al., 1990) supported, but did
not prove, that the RYRl gene is mutated to cause MH
in humans. The recent reports of families in which MH
(Levitt et
fails to segregate with RYRl polymorphisms
al., 1991; Deufel et al., 1992) suggest additional caution
in the interpretation
of the earlier studies and, at the
very least, point to genetic heterogeneity
among MH
families.
Many of the data implicating the RYRl gene in defects leading to MH sensitivity come from studies in the
pig. We recently identified a candidate mutation, substitution of Cys for Arg615 in the pig genome, and showed
that this genetic alteration segregated consistently with

the MH phenotype in over 450 animals examined, including 338 meioses. The corresponding mutation in humans, Cys for Arg614, has also been found in one MH
family, where it segregates with the phenotype in three
meioses, giving support to the hypothesis that certain
mutations in RYRl are causative of MH (Gillard et al.,
1991).
In the present study, we report the identification
of
several new polymorphisms
that can be applied to linkage studies in MH families and we report a second candidate mutation, adding to the evidence implicating the
RYRl gene in MH.
The RFLPs from the coding region of the RYRl gene,
described in this paper, have proven to be informative in
most of our MH families, including all of those informative for the earlier markers. Use of these markers was
rapid and simple, confirming our earlier findings of linkage between MH and RYRl genes. The eight substitutions that failed to alter a restriction endonuclease site
might also be applied to linkage studies and family analysis by means of single strand conformation
polymorphisms or SSCPs (Orita et al., 1989). The availability of
some 32 polymorphisms
in the RYRl gene, 24 of which
are detected as RFLPs, will make analysis of inheritance
of specific RYRl haplotypes informative
in most MH
families.
Our results exclude three of the four amino acid substitutions that we observed as candidate mutations for
predisposition
to MH and suggest that the fourth, Arg
for G~Y’~~,may predispose to MH in the single family in
which it has been observed. This candidate mutation
was observed in only the family of TJ, consistent with
the RYRl haplotype analysis (Table 3), which demonstrated that TJ did not have the relatively common MH
haplotype shared by the majority of our MH patients,
including BT. The MH haplotype in TJ’s family closely

resembles that of the normal maternal chromosome in
family 1, differing only at the G1y248locus. HJ, for whom
family members are unavailable, has a unique genotype
among our MH family members. The association of the
Arg248 mutation with MH will require linkage analysis in
larger families or direct biochemical
or physiological
demonstration
that this mutation appropriately
alters
Ca2+-release channel function.
Amino acid substitutions
have not yet been observed
in either HJ or BT. Approximately
10% of the RYRl
coding sequence of patients HJ and BT, mostly within
20 bp adjacent to each of the primers used in direct sequencing, remains to be sequenced. Candidate mutations causative for MH in these patients may lie within
these regions. The R YRl coding sequence of patient TJ
has been completely analyzed by cloning and sequencing
with a minimum of five clones covering each region analyzed. This technique avoided the gaps left in the direct
sequencing method, but introduced
the potential
for
error due to PCR artifacts or to the lack of amplification
of the mutant haplotype in the clones that were analyzed. Thus, there is a slight chance (~4%) that a candidate mutation may have been overlooked by this technique. Accordingly, we cannot state categorically that
Arg for G1y248 is the sole candidate mutation
in the
RYRl gene for predisposition to MH in the family of TJ.
Confirmation
of Arg for G1yz4* as a mutation causative
for predisposition to MH will await its identification
and
correct segregation in additional families or functional
studies on the resultant ryanodine receptor.
