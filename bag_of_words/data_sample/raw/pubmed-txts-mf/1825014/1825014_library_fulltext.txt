Summary
Tay-Sachs disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by defects in the 0-hexosaminidase
a-subunit gene. The carrier frequency for Tay-Sachs disease is significantly elevated in both the Ashkenazi
Jewish and Moroccan Jewish populations but not in other Jewish groups. We have found that the mutations
underlying Tay-Sachs disease in Ashkenazi and Moroccan Jews are different. Analysis of a Moroccan Jewish
Tay-Sachs patient has revealed an in-frame deletion (AF) of one of the two adjacent phenylalanine codons
that are present at positions 304 and 305 in the a-subunit sequence. The mutation impairs the subunit
assembly of 0-hexosaminidase A, resulting in an absence of enzyme activity. The Moroccan patient was found
also to carry, in the other a-subunit allele, a different, and as yet unidentified, mutation which causes a
deficit of mRNA. Analysis of obligate carriers from six unrelated Moroccan Jewish families showed that three
harbor the AF mutation, raising the possibility that this defect may be a prevalent mutation in this ethnic
group.

Introduction

Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder
caused by an absence of the lysosomal enzyme, P-hexosaminidase A (reviewed by Neufeld [1989] and Sandhoff et al. [1989]). The enzyme, a heterodimer composed of noncovalently associated a- and 13-subunits,
acts on a variety of substrates containing terminal
N-acetylglucosaminides and N-acetylgalatosaminides,
including GM2 ganglioside. In Tay-Sachs disease, mutations in the a-subunit gene cause the enzyme deficiency, and, as a consequence, undegraded GM2 ganglioside accumulates in lysosomes. This process is
particularly injurious to neurons and leads to nervous
system deterioration. In affected individuals, mental
and motor impairment begins in the first year of life
and progresses rapidly, with death ensuing in early
childhood.

Among the general population the Tay-Sachs disease carrier frequency, calculated from the incidence
of the disease, is estimated to be 1/300 (Sandhoff et
al. 1989). This frequency is elevated among certain
ethnic groups. The most well-known example is the
Ashkenazi Jewish population, in which rv3 % (1 /3 1)
of the population carry an a-subunit mutation. The
major mutation, a 4-bp insertion in exon 11 of the
a-subunit gene, accounts for rv70% of the mutant
alleles. Most of the remaining Tay-Sachs alleles in the
population contain a splice-junction mutation at the
5' end of intron 12 (Arpaia et al. 1988; Myerowitz
1988; Myerowitz and Costigan 1988; Ohno and Suzuki 1988; Paw et al. 1990; Triggs-Raine et al. 1990).
A second well-characterized group with an increased
incidence of Tay-Sachs disease is within the FrenchCanadian population in eastern Canada, where the
carrier frequency is similar to that in the Ashkenazi
population (Andermann et al. 1977). In the FrenchCanadian isolate, as with Ashkenazi Jews, one particular mutation predominates, in this case a 7.6-kb deletion at the 5' end of the a-subunit gene (Myerowitz
and Hogikyan 1987; Hectman et al. 1989).
It has been established that Moroccan Jews, a sub-

Tay-Sachs Mutation in Moroccan Jews
group of Sephardic Jews, also have an elevated carrier
frequency, estimated to be 'v1 /60, for Tay-Sachs disease (Vecht et al. 1983; R. Navon and E. Ackstein,
unpublished data). The high carrier frequency in Ashkenazi and Moroccan Jews does not extend to other
Jewish populations. Evidence has been presented suggesting that the Ashkenazi and Moroccan mutations
may be distinct (Bach et al. 1976).
In the present study we demonstrate that the molecular defects that cause Tay-Sachs disease in Ashkenazi
and Moroccan Jews are different. Analysis of a Moroccan Jewish Tay-Sachs patient has demonstrated an
in-frame phenylalanine codon deletion (AF) in the
a-subunit gene. The mutation impairs the folding and
assembly of the a-subunit, resulting in an absence of
enzyme activity. The Moroccan patient was also
found to carry, in the other allele, a different, and as
yet unidentified, mutation, which causes a deficit of
mRNA. Analysis of Tay-Sachs disease obligate carriers from six unrelated Moroccan Jewish families revealed that three carry the AF mutation.
Experimental Procedures
Reagents

Tissue culture medium and reagents were from Biofluids (Rockville, MD). Immuno-Precipitin was from
Bethesda Research Laboratories. Enlightening was
from Amersham [35S]Methionine (1,000 Ci/mmol),
[32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), and GeneScreenPlus membranes were from New England Nuclear. The reagents
for the PCR technique were from Perkin Elmer-Cetus.
Reagents for DNA sequencing were from U.S. Biochemicals. Low-melting-temperature agarose (SeaPlaque) was from FMC BioProducts (Rockland, ME).
DEAE-dextran was from Pharmacia. AMV reverse
transcriptase and oligo(dT)1s were from Promega. Restriction enzymes, DNA ligase, and T4 DNA kinase
were from New England Biolabs. T4 DNA polymerase was from Bio-Rad. 4-Methylumbelliferyl-6-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranoside was from
Toronto Research Chemicals.
Moroccan Patient and Carriers

The Moroccan Jewish Tay-Sachs patient was born
in Israel. Both parents were born in Morocco - the
father (MD) in Rabat, the mother (AD) in Casablanca.
The patient had classical signs of infantile Tay-Sachs
disease, and the diagnosis was confirmed by a deficiency of 1-hexosaminidase A in her serum, leukocytes, and skin fibroblasts.

413

All of the Moroccan Jewish carriers were obligate
heterozygotes for Tay-Sachs disease. The carriers
were found to have heterozygote levels of 1-hexosaminidase A, both in serum and in leukocyte samples.
All were born in Morocco - SiM in Rabat, SY and SM
in Marrakech, AR and HA in Casablanca, and AM in
Fez. MD and SiM are first cousins, as are SY and SM.
Cell Culture

Normal human fetal lung fibroblasts, IMR-90, were
obtained from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). A skin fibroblast culture was
derived from the Moroccan Jewish patient with TaySachs disease. COS 1 cells were obtained from the
American Type Tissue Culture Collection. Cells were
cultured at 37PC in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 25 mM
HEPES, 10% FBS, and antibiotics (growth medium).
Fibroblast Labeling and Immunoprecipitation
Human fibroblast cultures in 100-mm dishes were
labeled with 400 gCi of [35S]methionine in 5 ml
DMEM (formulated without methionine) containing
5% dialyzed FBS. After 16 h the medium was collected, and the cells were rinsed twice with PBS. The
cell monolayers were incubated with PBS containing
1% Nonidet P-40 and 10 mg BSA/ml for 15 min at
room temperature. The resulting cell extract and medium samples were preabsorbed with 100 jl of
Immuno-Precipitin. To determine the association
state of the a-subunit, the samples were divided in half
and were first immunoprecipitated with 3 il of either
anti-,B-hexosaminidase A, which recognizes all forms
of the a-subunit, or anti-hexosaminidase B, which will
precipitate only a-subunits that are associated with

1-subunits (Proia et al. 1984). After incubation for
2 h, 40 gl of Immuno-Precipitin was added, and the
immune complexes were collected by centrifugation.
The precipitate was washed twice with PBS containing
0. 1% Nonidet P-40. The labeled proteins were solubilized by heating at 95Â°C for 5 min in 100 pl of PBS
containing 1% SDS and 10 mM DTT. The ImmunoPrecipitin was removed by centrifugation, and 0.9 ml
of PBS containing 2% Nonidet P-40, 10 mg BSA/ml,
and 10 mM iodoacetamide was added to the supernatant. The samples were preabsorbed with ImmunoPrecipitin as before and then incubated overnight at
40C with 3 ml of anti-denatured a-subunit serum.
After incubation with 40 pl of Immuno-Precipitin, the
immune complexes were washed three times with a
buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.6 M NaCl,

Navon and Proia

0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS, pH 8.6. The
labeled proteins were solubilized in sample buffer (1 %
SDS, 0.125 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 10% glycerol),
were reduced with 10 mM DTT, and were electrophoresed on 8%-16% gradient gels in the presence of
SDS. The gels were saturated with Enlightening, were
dried, and were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film
at 700C.
Site-directed Mutagenesis

Introduction of the AF mutation into the a-subunit
was accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis according to a method described elsewhere (Kunkel et
al. 1987) by using single-stranded M13 containing the
a-subunit (Navon and Proia 1989) and the mutagenic
oligonucleotide (antisense), 5' GCT GAC TTC TAA
GAA TGT GCT CAT GAA CTC 3'.
Cell Transfections

The normal a-subunit cDNA and the a-subunit
with the AF mutation were cloned into the expression
vector, pSVL, and were transfected into COS 1 cells
according to a method described elsewhere (Navon
and Proia 1989). Cell extracts were assayed for 13-hexosaminidase activity by 4-methylumbelliferyl-6-sulfo2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranoside according to a
method described elsewhere (Navon and Proia 1989).
Mutation Detection by DNA Sequence Analysis

Total RNA was prepared from human fibroblast
cultures by the guanidine isothiocyanate/CsCl method
(Chirgwin et al. 1979), and the polyA+ fraction was
isolated using an oligo(dT)-cellulose column (Aviv
and Leder 1972). The polyA + RNA (2 ig) was reverse
transcribed using AMV reverse transcriptase and
oligo(dT)ls. Segments of the a-subunit were amplified
by the PCR technique (Saiki et al. 1988) using Taq
DNA polymerase and a-subunit-specific oligonucleotide primers which contained an additional EcoRI sequence at their 5' end. The DNA was subjected to
amplification on a Perkin Elmer -Cetus thermocycler
for 39 cycles. Each cycle was 2 min at 940C for denaturation, 3 min at 600C for annealing, and 6 min at
720C for primer extension. The amplified segments
were cleaved with EcoRI and isolated from a lowmelting-temperature agarose gel and were ligated into
the EcoRI site of the M13mpl8 vector. From the recombinant clones, single-stranded DNA was isolated
and sequenced by the dideoxy-chain termination method (Sanger et al. 1977) using Sequenase.
Direct sequencing of DNA derived from asymmetric

PCR amplification was accomplished according to a
method described elsewhere (Kadowaki et al. 1990).
The first amplification was accomplished using 5'
GCA GGT GAA ATC AAC CTC ATC TCC TCC
(primer 1) and 5'ACT CCT GGA TTA CTG ACT
CCT TGC TAC (primer 2). A portion of the first
reaction was subjected to asymmetric amplification
using only primer 1. Sequencing was performed using
a [32p] end-labeled internal primer, 5'TGC TAC TCT
GGG TCT GAG CCC.
Mutation Detection by Hybridization with Allele-specific
Oligonucleotide Probes

For detection of the AF mutation, cDNA prepared
as described above, or genomic DNA was amplified
using primer 1 and primer 2. The DNA was subjected
to amplification on a Perkin-Elmer Cetus thermocycler for 39 cycles. Each cycle was 2 min at 940C for
denaturation, 2.5 min at 600C for annealing and 3 min
at 720C for synthesis. The Ashkenazi infantile TaySachs mutations were amplified according to a method
described elsewhere (Myerowitz 1988; Myerowitz
and Costigan 1988). The conditions for mutation detection by dot blotting and hybridization were as described elsewhere (Navon and Proia 1989). The sequence of the oligonucleotide probe specific for the
AF mutation was 5'ATG AGC ACA TTC TTA GAA
GTC. The sequence of the corresponding normal
probe was 5'AGC ACA TTC TTC TTA GAA GTC.
The sequences of the probes for detection of the Ashkenazi infantile mutations were as described elsewhere
(Myerowitz 1988; Myerowitz and Costigan 1988).
Results

Control IMR-90 fibroblasts and a fibroblast culture
derived from a Moroccan patient with Tay-Sachs disease were labeled with [35S]methionine for 16 h, and
the cell extracts and medium were immunoprecipitated with antiserum prepared against either hexosaminidase A, which precipitates all forms of the
a-subunit (total), or anti-hexosaminidase B, which
precipitates only a-subunits associated with 1B-subunits (associated) (Proia et al. 1984). In contrast to
the IMR-90 fibroblast extracts, which contained both
precursor and mature a-subunits, the extracts from
the Moroccan Tay-Sachs fibroblasts contained only
precursor a-subunits (fig. 1). The a-subunits synthesized by the Tay-Sachs fibroblast culture were not immunoprecipitated by antibodies against the 1-subunits
(associated), demonstrating that the a-subunits pro-

duced by these cells were not competent for assembly
with 3-subunits.
The cell-labeling experiment demonstrated that
a-subunit protein was produced by these cells. As expected, northern analysis revealed easily detectable
a-subunit mRNA in the Moroccan Tay-Sachs fibroblasts (not shown). To identify the mutation carried
by the Moroccan patient, mRNA was isolated from
the fibroblast culture and was reverse transcribed into
cDNA, and portions of the a-subunit cDNA were amplified by the PCR technique and were cloned and
sequenced. This analysis revealed a deletion of one of
the two adjacent phenylalanine codons (TTC) that
are present at positions 304 and 305 in the normal
a-subunit sequence (Myerowitz et al. 1985) (fig. 2).
To verify the result, genomic DNA was amplified in

demonstrated the sequence containing phenylalanine
deletion (AF) superimposed on a normal sequence
(N). Thus, the patient carries two different a-subunit
alleles -one with the AF mutation and the other with
a normal sequence in this region.
The AF mutation was introduced into the normal
a-subunit cDNA by oligonucleotide-mediated sitedirected mutagenesis. The normal and the mutated
cDNAs were expressed in COS 1 cells under the control of the SV40 early promoter. As shown in table 1,
the AF mutation rendered the a-subunit enzymatically
inactive. In the transfected COS 1 cells the a-subunit
carrying the AF mutation was found only as precursor
in the cells, with none secreted into the medium (fig.
4), a finding similar to results obtained with the Moroccan Tay-Sachs fibroblast culture.
Genomic DNA from Moroccan Jewish individuals
who were obligate carriers for Tay-Sachs disease were
tested for the presence of the AF mutation. The region
of the mutation was amplified by the PCR technique,

Discussion

The Moroccan Jewish Tay-Sachs patient that we
have described carries two different Tay-Sachs alleles.
In one allele a 3-bp deletion results in the in-frame
removal of one of the two successive phenylalanine
codons that occur at positions 304 and 305 in the
normal a-subunit sequence. The other allele contains
an as yet unidentified mutation. We found that this
unidentified mutation caused a significant decrease in
the amount of a-subunit mRNA, suggesting a defect
in transcription or mRNA stability. The unidentified
mutation in both the Moroccan patient and obligate
heterozygotes was not one of the two Ashkenazi infantile mutations. Different a-subunit mutations in the
Ashkenazi and Moroccan Jewish populations are consistent with the hypothesis that Tay-Sachs disease
mutations originated and expanded in the Ashkenazi
Jewish population after the migration of their predecessors to Europe (Myrianthopoulos and Aronson
1966; Petersen et al. 1983).
The AF mutation occurred in the context of a stretch
of pyrimidines, TTC TTC TT, containing direct trinucleotide repeats. The deletion of a short direct repeat is consistent with a "slipped mispairing" model in
which strand slippage and mispairing during DNA
replication causes a loop out of a repeat sequence
which is subsequently excised (Farabaugh and Miller
1978; Efstatiadis et al. 1980).
The fibroblast culture derived from the Moroccan
patient synthesized an a-subunit that is unable to assemble with the 5-subunit to form I-hexosaminidase
A. Although the patient is a compound heterozygote,
all or most of the a-subunit protein detected in the
fibroblasts is likely to be derived from the AF allele
because expression of transcript from the other allele is
severely depressed. Also, the AF protein, in precursor
form, is relatively stable as determined from the transfection experiment, arguing against the possibility that
the AF protein might be rapidly degraded -and thus
undetectable - in the patient's fibroblasts. It cannot be
determined at this time whether the mutation induces

418

a global alteration in the folding of the a-subunit or
whether this change has a more direct effect on the
assembly process. The two adjacent phenylalanines at
positions 304 and 305 in the human a-subunit are
conserved in the homologous human and mouse 13-subunits (Myerowitz et al. 1985; Korneluk et al. 1986;
Bapat et al. 1988; Proia 1988), suggesting that this
region may be important for folding or attainment of
the final enzyme structure. It is interesting that in the
mouse a-subunit (S. Yamanaka and R. L. Proia, unpublished data) and in the single Dictyostelium hexosaminidase gene (Graham et al. 1988) the second phenylalanine is conserved, with the first being replaced
by a leucine.
Among Ashkenazi Jews, three a-subunit mutations
account for nearly all of the alleles that cause TaySachs disease and its milder variant, adult GM2 gangliosidosis (Neufeld 1989). It has been suggested that a
DNA-based assay, because of its high specificity and
ability to distinguish between the adult and infantile
disorders, may be very useful when used in conjunction with enzyme screening for Tay-Sachs disease carriers among Ashkenazi Jews (Paw et al. 1990; TriggsRaine et al. 1990). The finding that the AF mutation
was carried by three of six unrelated Moroccan Jewish
families harboring a Tay-Sachs allele raises the possibility that this may be a prevalent mutation among
this population. At the present time there are 500,000
Moroccan Jews and 1,500,000 Ashkenazi Jews living
in Israel, with significant intermarriage between the
populations (Vecht et al. 1983). DNA-based testing
of enzymatically identified carriers among Israeli Jews
should include the AF mutation, as well as the three
Ashkenazi mutations. In addition, it is important that
the other Moroccan mutation(s) be identified for incorporation into the DNA-based testing.
