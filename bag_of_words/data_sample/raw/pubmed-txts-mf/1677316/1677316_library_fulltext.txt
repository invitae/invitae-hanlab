Summary
Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease type 1A (CMTi A) was
localized by genetic mapping to a 3 CM interval on human chromosome
17~. DNA markers within this interval revealed a duplication that is completely linked and
associated with CMTl A. The duplication
was demonstrated in affected individuals
by the presence of three
alleles at a highly polymorphic
locus, by dosage differences at RFLP alleles, and by two-color fluorescence
in situ hybridization.
Pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis
of genomic DNA from patients of different ethnic origins showed a novel Sacll fragment of 500 kb associated
with CMTlA. A severely affected CMTIA offspring
from a mating between two affected individuals
was
demonstrated
to have this duplication
present on each
chromosome
17. We have demonstrated
that failure to
recognize the molecular duplication
can lead to misinterpretation
of marker genotypes for affected individuals, identification
of false recombinant!%
and incorrect
localization
of the disease locus.
Introduction
Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease (CMT) is an inherited peripheral neuropathy in humans with involvement of both
the motor and sensory nerves (Charcot and Marie, 1886;
Lupski et al., 1991) and a prevalence rate of 1 in 2500
(Skre, 1974). Most families demonstrate autosomal dominant Mendelian segregation, although autosomal recessive and X-linked forms of the disease have been reported
(McKusick, 1990). The most common form of the disease,

CMT type 1 (CMTl), is characterized by distal muscle atrophy, decreased nerve conduction velocities (NCV), and
a hypertrophic neuropathyon nerve biopsy. CMTl is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease, the clinical expression of which is age dependent and the penetrance
of which is nearly complete (Bird and Kraft, 1978). The
average age at onset of clinical symptoms is 12.2 + 7.3
years. Recent studies provide convincing evidence that
abnormal NCV (<40 m/s) is highly diagnostic of CMTl and
is a 100% penetrant phenotype that is essentially independent of age (Lupski et al., 1991).
CMTl displays marked clinical variability both within
and between families, suggesting genetic heterogeneity.
Since the molecular basis of this disorder is unknown,
linkage studies are indispensable for mapping the gene(s)
responsible for CMTl and to ascertain whether multiple
genes, multiple alleles, or both lead to the clinical variation
in symptoms. Genetic linkage studies in large pedigrees
(see Lupski et al., 1991, for review) suggest the existence
of at least three distinct loci causing CMTl: the CMTlA
locus maps to human chromosome 17 (region pl I-~12)
(Vance et al., 1989; Raeymakers et al., 1989; MiddletonPrice et al., 1990; Timmerman et al., 1990; McAlpine et
al., 1990; Chance et al., 1990; Pate1 et al., 1990a, 1990b;
Vance et al., 1991); the CMTlB locus maps to human
chromosome 1 (region q23-q25) (Bird et al., 1982); and a
third type is unlinked to both the CMTlA and CMTIB loci
(Chance et al., 1990).
These studies provide the basis for isolating the disease
gene(s) by virtue of map position. Positional cloning experiments can be aided by the existence of patients with specific chromosomal
DNA rearrangements.
However, no
chromosomal anomaly, indicative of genomic DNA rearrangement, has been described in CMTlA patients. We
have now identified a DNA duplication in CMTlA. By a
series of molecular and genetic methods, we demonstrate
complete linkage and association of this duplication in
seven multigenerational
CMTlA pedigrees and in several
isolated, unrelated patients. The DNA duplication is transmitted to affected offspring without recombination, but failure to recognize this duplication leads to incorrect interpretation of the marker genotypes of affected individuals and
an incorrect localization of the disease gene. The discoveryof this DNA rearrangement is an important step toward
the identification of the gene(s) involved by positional cloning and has implications for disease diagnosis in individuals without a firm family history. Our findings implicate a
local DNA duplication, a segmental trisomy, as a novel
mechanism for an autosomal dominant human disease.
Results
RFLP and Family Studies
Seven large families segregating
autosomal dominant
CMTI , as evidenced by vertical male-to-male transmission, were identified. Six of these families, HOUl (Pate1 et

HOUI, HOU2 (Killian and Kloepfer, 1979), HOU42, HOU85, HOU88, and HOU89 are of French-Acadian
descent while HOU76 is of Ashkenazic
Jewish descent. Standard pedigree symbols are used; disease is indicated by the darkened symbols. The laboratory identification
number andthe
(GT), genotype of each individual are indicated below the-pedigree
symbols. (GT). genotypes were obtained by PCR analysis and were scored for
the number of visible alleles using a standardized
coding system: A = 165 bp, B = 163 bp, C = 161 bp, D = 159 bp, E = 157 bp, F = 155 bp,
G = 153 bp. When a single allele was evident in an individual, it was scored as being present in two copies. Data were scored blind to disease
status, and scoring was confirmed
by two other investigators.
Careful inspection of the relative intensity of the Mendelian inheritance
of each allele
was conducted
to avoid scoring of shadow bands as alleles. The number of alleles evident in an affected individual depends on the number of
distinguishable
alleles segregating
in the parents. In cases where all four parental chromosomes
can be distinguished
(e.g., unaffected father 1-49
genotype FG and affected mother 1-9 genotype ABC), the three alleles in the affected sons (l-153 and I-37ABG;
1-38 ABF) can be easily visualized.
On the other hand, in HOU76 the affected father 76-270, with genotype BCE, and his unaffected spouse, 76-271, with genotype DE have an affected

HOU88, and HOU89, are of French-Acadian origin, while
HOU76 is an Ashkenazic Jewish family (Figure 1). To accurately map the CMTl A gene in these pedigrees, 17 DNA
polymorphisms localized to the proximal region of chromosome 17p and a highly polymorphic marker on chromosome 1q were studied. In view of the demonstrated genetic
heterogeneity, we required that each family provide independent evidence of linkage to a specific chromosomal
region. Initial linkage analysis was restricted to the large
families HOUl, HOU2, HOU42, HOU85, and HOU89 (Figure 1). Families HOU76 and HOU88 were too small to
include or exclude linkage to a specific location but were
useful in the association study described below.
The pooled evidence for linkage (LOD scores) from all
five pedigrees, the maximum likelihood estimates of the
recombination
value (4) between CMTl and various genetic markers, and the peak LOD scores (2) for nine loci
are shown in Table 1. The immunoglobulin
receptor FcyRll
on chromosome Iq shows complete linkage to C,MTl in a
large Indiana kindred (R. Lebo, personal communication)
and is diagnostic of CMTlB. None of our families show
linkage to FcyRll (6 = 0.5,i = 0.0, Table 1). Individually,
each pedigree showed negative LOD scores (data not
shown), and together these families exclude linkage to a
region 20 recombination units (0 = 0.20) on either side of
FcrRII.
Linkage analysis was performed using the 17p probes
LEW301, YNM67R5,
1516, AlO-41, S6.1-HB2, 1517,
MYH2, and 1541. All markers except 1541 showed LOD
scores exceeding 3.0 (Table l), and all loci except MYHP
and 1541 showed recombination values of 4.6% or less,
demonstrating tight linkage of the disease to the 17p region. Each individual family, except HOU42, showed a
LOD score of 3.0 or greater with one or more DNA markers
in this region (data not shown); HOU42 showed a peak
LOD score of 2.9 at i? = 6 with the DNA probe YNM67-R5.

Statistical tests on all the marker data suggested that the
disease locus in these families mapped to the same location on chromosome 17p and segregated CMTl A. For further confirmation, we calculated the peak multipoint LOD
score for each family, including HOU42, with respect to
the map LEW301 -YNM67-R5-Al0-41
-MYHP
using
the computer program CRI-MAP; these LOD scores were
6.27,3.79,3.98,4.28,
and 4.84for HOUl, HOU2, HOU42,
HOU85, and HOU89, respectively, and confirmed their
classification as CMTlA families.
The DNA probes MYH2 and 1541, located on distal chromosome 17p, demonstrated loose linkage to CMT; consequently, multiple recombinants between the disease and
these markers are observed in each family. On the other
hand, only five recombinants were detected for the markers closely linked to CMTl A. Of these, LEW301 and 1516
show no recombinants.
However, individual 89-401 in
HOU89 is recombinant for YNM67-R5, individual 85-326
in HOU85 is recombinant for AlO-41 and S6.1-HB2 (same
event detected), individual 1-13 in HOUl is recombinant
for S6.1-HB2, and individual 2-448 and one of the spouses
of 2-439 in HOU2 are recombinant for 1517. The order of
the closely linked 17p DNA probes is LEW301 -(YNM67R5, 1516)-(AlO-41,
S6.1-HB2)-1517
and covers a distance of 9.9 CM. The five families contain approximately
108 meioses, which for the LEW301-1517
interval should
contain 9.7 f 3.1 recombinants. The observed number of
recombinants (5) is well within expectations (x2 = 2.30, 1
degree of freedom, P > 0.10). These recombinants suggest that CMTlA is localized between LEW301 and 1517,
which corresponds to an interval of approximately 10 million bp, assuming that recombination is uniform in the human genome. In the following section we report isolation
of a highly informative (CT), polymorphism that detects
multiple alleles in CMTl A patients. Genotypes at this locus
are also provided in Figure 1.

with the alleles
A and E in HOU2, HOU42, and HOU88, with alleles A and B in HOUl, with alleles C and D in HOU85 and HOU89, and with alleles B and E in
HOU76.

alleles, but the higher intensity of allele E in each of these patients
suggests
a double dose for this allele. (6) shows inheritance
of three
alleles in CMT patients from a nuclear family of Ashkenazic

descent, in contrast to the other families, which are of French-Acadian
descent.

Locus
Demonstrates
a Duplication
Associated
with CMTIA
We screened CMTl A-linked 17p DNA probes for the presence of simple sequence repeats such as (GT),, which
are known to be highly polymorphic and can be rapidly
analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Weber
and May, 1989; Litt and Luty, 1989). (CT), sequences were
identified in several probes, one of which, RMl I-GT, was
identified from VAW409Rl located at the Dl7S122 locus
(Wright et al., 1990). This marker maps to 17p11.2-pl2
and is also closely linked to CMTIA (Vance et al., 1991).
The five large French-Acadian
pedigrees segregating
CMTlA and the two small kindreds of French-Acadian
(HOUSS) and Ashkenazic Jewish (HOU76) descent were
genotyped for RMl l-GT. Genotype data from two nuclear
CMTIA families within HOU88 and HOU76 are shown in
Figure 2. These data demonstrate a striking observation:

six of eight CMTIA individuals show three (CT), alleles
(e.g., individuals 88-340, 76-352), but all unaffected individuals are either homozygous or heterozygous for (GT).
alleles. In certain matings, only two (GT), alleles were segregating and thus only two (CT), alleles could be detected
in the affected child. However, careful examination of the
autoradiograph
often revealed that one of the two (CT),
alleles was present in two copies (e.g., 88-339, 88-380 in
Figure 2A). These data indicate that CMTIA patients of
French-Acadian
(Figure 2A) and Ashkenazic Jewish (Figure 2B) descent have three copies of the Dl7Sl22 locus,
suggesting a duplication of this locus in CMTlA patients.
Genotypes for RMI I-GT for all seven CMTl A pedigrees
are shown in Figure 1 and demonstrate that three RMI lGT alleles are present only in affected individuals and are
never observed in 53 unaffected offspring and 31 unaffected spouses. The transmission of this duplication is also
highly specific. By considering all completely informative
RMI l-GT matings, such as ABC x DE, we observed 45
cases of transmission of the duplicated allele from affected
parents to affected offspring and 18 cases where the affected parent transmitted a single allele to their normal
offspring. In these matings, none of the unaffected offspring received the duplicated DNA segment and none
of the affected offspring received a single allele from the
affected parent. Thus, in 63 fully informative meioses the
duplication was faithfully transmitted to the affected offspring and without recombination with the normal chromosome (LOD score, 2 = 18.96 at r!r = 0.0).

Dosage Differences at an Mspl RFLP Detected by
Probe VAW409R3 at the Dl7Sl22
Locus Confirm
the CMTI A-Specific
Duplication
The demonstration of three copies of D175122 in CMTlA
patients by (CT), allele analysis led us to examine the
dosage of polymorphic Mspl alleles at this locus. Two Mspl
restriction fragment length polymorphisms
(RFLPs) are
detected by the marker D17Sl22 (Wright et al., 1989;
Vance et al. 1991) by Southern blot analysis using 11 kb
(VAW409Rl) and 2.1 kb EcoRl (VAW409R3) subclones of
phage VAW409 as standard two- and three-allele RFLPs,
respectively. Dosage differences that followed Mendelian
inheritance were observed in CMTIA patients using the
probe VAW409R3, as shown in Figure 3.
The Mspl genotypes in a nuclear family of pedigree
HOU85 are shown in Figure 3A. The unaffected father
(85-301) has genotype BB, and his unaffected daughters
(85-326 and 85-312) have genotype AB The affected
mother (85-302) and her affected sons (85-303 and 85-304)
also have genotype AB, but inspection of the autoradiograph shows clear dosage differences between the two
alleles such that 85-302, 85-303, and 85-304 have genotypes AAB, ABB, and ABB, respectively. The VAW409R3
genotypes in Figure3Aalsoshowthat
theCMT1 Achromosome harbors both an A and a B allele and that the AB
combination segregates in a Mendelian fashion.

common examples of informative CMTlA individuals are
shown in lanes 4-6 (genotype ABB) and lanes 7 and 8
(genotype AAB). The presence of an extra allele can be
noted in individuals of AAB and ABB genotypes by comparing the ratio of the hybridization signal for one allele
to the other. Lanes l-3 in Figure 3C represent CMTlA
individuals who were fully informative for the RFLP and
demonstrated three polymorphic alleles resulting in a genotype ABC. Three copies of the allele could also be noted
in affected individuals of genotype AAA or BBB when the
signal from a control probe was used for normalization
(data not shown).
To confirm this observation, 103 CMTlA patients from
seven families (Figure 1) as well as 26 other unrelated
patients were examined by Southern blot analysis with
VAW409R3. Dosage of alleles was determined by visual
examination and densitometry of autoradiographs
or by
quantitation of total radioactivity in each allele using a Betascope analyzer (Sullivan et al., 1987). Dosage was determined only in individuals who were heterozygous for the
RFLP since the results were most reproducible and reliable in such cases. Seventy-six CMTl A patients were heterozygous for this RFLP and were conclusively demonstrated to have three copies of the D17S122 locus. In contrast, none of 63 controls (27 unaffected at-risk individuals
with normal NCV and 36 controls with no family history
of CMT) who were heterozygous for this marker showed
dosage differences for this RFLP, suggesting that the genotype with dosage differences was specific to CMTlA
patients (x2 = 48.72; P < 1 Om5).Similar dosage differences
were observed with the marker VAW409Rl
(data not
shown).

Demonstration
of Two (GT). Alleles in Mspl
Fragments Showing Dosage Differences
We next demonstrated that the Mspl allele8 present in two
copies by dosage differences in CMTlA patients contain
two (CT), alleles, using preparative gel separation of the
polymorphic alleles (Bedford and van Helden, 1990). Mspl
alleles revealed by VAW409Rl
(Di 7S122) showing dosage differences in CMTlA patients, and from which the
marker RM 11 -GT was derived, were separated on agarose
gels and used as templates for PCR amplification
of
RMl l-GT. The analysis required affected individuals to
have three distinguishable (GT), alleles and that these individuals be heterozygous for the Mspl RFLP.
Figure 4A displays representative data from a nuclear
family within kindred HOU42. The unfractionated genomic
DNA from these individuals as well as their separated Mspl
allelic fractions were genotyped for RMl l-GT. Figure 48
indicates that in each instance, a patient with a polymorphic allele of double intensity had two (CT), alleles,
whereas a single (CT)” allele was evident in the other polymorphic allele showing normal intensity in the patients and
in all unaffected individuals.

Mutation
in a Severely Affected Individual
A severe clinical phenotype has been previously reported
in an individual who was the product of a consanguineous
mating between first cousins affected with CMT and hypothesized to represent homozygous expression of adominant gene for CMT (Killian and Kloepfer, 1979). A Small
nuclear family within pedigree HOU42 (Figure 1) demonstrated a mating between two affected individuals. One of

(A) A 5.3 kb Mspl fragment from within VAW409Rl

locus was hybridized
to a Southern blot of Mspl-digested
DNAs from
a nuclear family from HOU42. The RFLP genotypes
based on dosage
of alleles are indicated at the top of the autoradiograph.
Measurement
of total counts in each band using the Betascope analyzer (Sullivan et
al., 1987) confirmed this visually determined
genotype.
Note that the
affected individuals 42-218 and 42-225 have two copies of the A allele
and one copy of the B allele. Examination
of Mendelian inheritance
in
this kindred indicated that the disease segregates
with the alleles AB.
(B) An agarose gel similar to that in (A) was prepared, and the regions
corresponding
to alleles A and B, respectively,
were cut out and the
allelic fractions
genotyped
for (GT), alleles as described
in Experimental Procedures.
The products obtained with undigested
DNA from
each individual are shown in the lanes identified by the identification
number of the individual, and those obtained from the corresponding
A and B alleles are shown in the lanes marked A and B. Note that the
A allele of individual 42-218 and 42-225, which is present in two copies,
shows two (GT), alleles while all other alleles are present in a single
copy and show one (GT), allele.

the two affected offsprings of this mating (42-333) demonstrated a severe clinical phenotype including early onset
(<1 year) and markedly reduced motor NCV (ml 0 m/s vs.
affected 20-40 m/s; unaffected >40 m/s). Examination of
the segregation of 17p markers in HOU42 demonstrated
that individual 42-333 had inherited two CMTlA chromosomes. The (GT), alleles A and E segregate with CMTlA
in the families of both the affected mother and affected
father. The (CT)” genotype of individual 42-333 is AE and
suggests that she inherited a CMTlA chromosome from
each of her parents. Her sister, 42-332, has inherited one
chromosome with the duplication genotype AE and has a
less severe clinical phenotype.
For further confirmation, somatic cell hybrids retaining

The chromosomes
17 of patients 42-332 and 42-333, offspring of a

Lysates from clones retaining each of the two chromosome

RMl I-GT, and the results are shown in Figure 5A. They
confirm the following: first, patients 42-331 and 42-332 are
heterozygous for the chromosome carrying the duplication; and second, patient 42-333 is homozygous for the
duplication, and each chromosome 17 homolog contains
two copies of the Dl7Sl22 locus. This nuclear family lends
support to the hypothesis that the duplication is responsible for the clinical phenotype of CMTlA and that CMTlA
is a semidominant mutation, since homozygosity for the
duplication results in a more severe clinical phenotype.
PFGE Analysis Identifies a Novel Sacll Fragment
in CMTlA Patients
To define this duplication more precisely and obtain an
estimate of its size, we performed long-range restriction
mapping using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE)
(Schwartz and Cantor, 1984). The restriction enzymes

FISH Analysis Reveals a Duplication
in Nuclei
of CMTlA Patients
Two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in interphase nuclei (Lawrence et al., 1990; Trasket al., 1991)
provided direct visualization of duplication of the VAW409
locus in CMTlA patients. VAW409 and a control probe
from 17~11.2 (~1516) were hybridized in a blind study to
nuclei from CMTlA patients 2-440 and 42-331 and unaffected controls 42-289 and 76-271. The hybridization sites
of VAW409 and cl516 were labeled with red and green
fluorochromes,
respectively. Because DNA replication
can result in double hybridization signals in interphase,
cl516 was included to identify cells that contained only
two single hybridization sites for this probe and, therefore,
had not replicated the CMTlA region.
A total of three red VAW409 sites (two near one of the
cl516 sites and one paired with the second cl516 site)
were observed in the majority of these cells ,from the
CMTlA patients (60% and 59% in 2-440 and 42-331, respectively) but in few cells from unaffected individuals (3%
and 6% in 42-289 and 76-271, respectively). In contrast,
only one VAW409 hybridization site was paired with each
single cl516 site in the majority of cells from unaffected
individuals (90% and 79% in 42-289 and 76-271, respectively). The nuclei from the homozygous patient 42-333
were similarly subjected to FISH analysis and demonstrated a total of four red VAW409 sites, two paired with
each green cl 516 site (Figure 7). Lymphoblasts from an
additional three CMTl A patients and four control individuals, for a total of six patients including one from the Ashkenazic Jewish family and six controls, were included in a
blind study to determine the relative number of hybridization sites of VAW409 and ~1516. In each case, the presence of a duplicated region in CMTlA patients was confirmed. This study demonstrates that duplications can be
readily detected in interphase nuclei using FISH.
Consequences
of the Duplication
on Linkage
Analysis for CMTlA Gene Localization
Genetic mapping in the CEPH reference families (Dausset, 1986) localizes probe VAW409 between A10-41 and
MYH2 at a distance of 1.3 CM from AlO-41. In Table 2, LOD
scores between CMTl A and polymorphisms detected by
probe VAW409 are presented. When scored as disomic
allelic systems, the recombination value between CMTlA
and VAW409R3 is 7.3% and surprisingly higher than the
other closely linked CMTlA markers. There were six recombinants with this probe, three each in families HOU85
(85312,85-320,85-326)
and HOU89 (89-342,89-343,
and
89-344). These recombinants were surprising since they
were clustered and greater in number than the five previously detected with other 17p markers spanning 9.9 CM.
The observation of dosage differences detected by VAW409 clarified not only the occurrence of a DNA duplication,
but also that failure to account for this duplication in linkage
analyses produces false recombinants.
This important phenomenon
is illustrated in Figure 8A

spring from a BB x AB mating is in itself a low probability
event [P = 0.002].) Dosage differences suggest instead
that the affected mother’s genotype is AAB, with the mutant gene-bearing
chromosome containing the two alleles
AB. The six affected offspring have genotype ABB based
on dosage, while the three unaffected offspring have genotype AB. Consequently,
the affected parent transmitted
the AB and A alleles to her affected and unaffected offspring, respectively, and no recombinants are evident. A
similar situation pertains to the three clustered recombinants in pedigree HOU89.
The VAW409R3 data were recoded as trisomic allele
systems and the data reanalyzed by linkage analysis. This
analysis (Table 2) based on dosage (VAW409R3d) shows
no recombination
between this marker and CMTlA at a
LOD score of 31.08 (Table 2) in 103 informative meioses.
Similarly, a second Mspl RFLP detected by the DNA probe
VAW409Rl also demonstrates dosage differences and recombination with CMTl A; taking dosage into account, this
probe (VAW409Rld)
shows complete linkage to CMTlA
at a LOD score of 17.56 in 58 informative meioses.
The genotypes for RMI l-GT were also used for linkage
analysis. CMTlA in these pedigrees shows complete linkage to RMl 1-GT at a LOD score of 36.74, with no recombinants being evident in 122 informative meioses. Individually, each family showed peak LOD scores of 3.0 or
greater, except HOU76 (2 = 2.01) and HOU88 (2 = 2.19);
these latter families have seven informative meioses each.
Thus, taking dosage differences into account at VAW409R1, VAW409R3, and RMl 1-GT, locus D17S122 shows
complete linkage to CMTlA.
Multipoint linkage analysis of CMTlA using the map
AlO-41-(1.3
CM)-RMll-GT-(11.7
CM)-MYH2
was
then performed using the program LINKAGE to calculate
confidence limits on the location of CMTl A. The peak
multipoint LOD score was 34.5; the CMTlA locus had the
maximum likelihood position at RMl l-GT, between AlO41 and MYHP. All other intervals were excluded with odds
of lO’*:l or greater. The approximate 95% confidence limits on the CMTlA location defined a 3 CM interval containing the probe RMll-GT.
A more extensive analysis
using the markers LEW301 -YNM67-R5-A10-41
-RMl lGT-MYHP
and the program CRI-MAP verified the placement of CMTlA at locus RMll-GT
and between the
probes Al O-41 and MYH2 with odds exceeding 1OOO:l.

Individuals 85-312, 85-320, and

Map (CM)

The failure to account for dosage differences at a twoallele RFLP in linkage analysis, when it exists, leads to
misinterpretation
of the parental origin of alleles, as shown
in Figure 8A. These errors appear as multiple, clustered
(within sibships) recombination
events that reduce the
LOD score and increase the recombination value between
the disease and the marker. More importantly, when these
errors are included, multipoint linkage analysis can seriously distort the positioning of the disease locus. This dramatic effect is shown in Figure 88, where we present the
multipoint LOD score for CMTlA versus a fixed map of
the markers LEW301 -YNM67-R5-AlO-41
-VAW409R3/
RMll-GT-1517-MYHP.

LOD score curve for two analyses using CRI-MAP that
are identical except that VAW409 was first coded as a
two-allele RFLP without dosage (VAW409R3) and a second time using the RMll-GT
polymorphism.
Using the
(GT), polymorphism, the multipoint LOD score is 31.4 and
correctly places the CMTlA locus at VAW409. The 95%
confidence limits on the CMTIA location define a 3 CM
interval around the (CT), locus. On the other hand, ignoring the duplication produces a peak LOD score of 26.81
and incorrectly places CMTlA 1 CM proximal to LEW301.
The 95% confidence limits on this location define a 6 CM
interval around LEW301. Not only do these two confidence
intervals fail to overlap, but the two LOD scores have an
odds difference of 104.6! Furthermore, the correct location
of CMTI at VAW409 is 50 times less likely than the incor-

rect location when dosage at VAW409R3 is not scored.
The misclassification
leads to multiple recombination
events with VAW409 and thus places the CMTlA locus
toward LEW301, with which no recombinants
were observed.
Discussion
We have demonstrated
that CMTlA is associated with
a DNA duplication using (GT), polymorphism
and RFLP
analysis, FISH analysis, and isolation of parental chromosomes in somatic cell hybrids. Three polymorphic markers
at the D17S122 locus have displayed this duplication,
namely, VAW409R3, VAW409R1, and RMI l-GT, and in
each case there is a perfect correlation between the duplication genotype and the CMTlA disease phenotype.
PFGE suggests that the duplication includes a large genomic region. We have shown that failure to understand the
molecular nature of the polymorphism leads to the mislocalization of CMTlA and reduced evidence for linkage.
Preliminary data by RFLP analysis and dosage of polymorphic alleles indicate that two additional markers, VAW412R3 (D17S125) and EW401 (D17S61) (Wright et al.,
1990), which are linked to VAW409, may also be duplicated, while other CMTl A-linked markers do not appear
to show evidence for duplication.
The demonstration of an autosomal dominant inherited
mutation involving DNA duplication in multiple families is

Cdl
228

unprecedented. Several linesof evidencesuggest
thatthis
duplication is responsible for the CMTlA phenotype. First,
the duplication mutation was observed only in CMTlA patients and not observed in 63 control individuals. Second,
the duplication was demonstrated in CMTlA patients of
French-Acadian
descent as well as Ashkenazic Jewish
origin. Third, a severely affected offspring of a mating between two affected individuals was shown to be homozygous for the duplication.
An important consequence
of our study is the use of
RMll-GT for CMTlA diagnosis. With the determination
of dosage at the D17S122 locus in CMTlA patients, the
positive predictive value of this DNA-based diagnostic test
is likely to increase dramatically. Furthermore, the novel
Sacll fragment observed by PFGE analysis as well as twocolor FISH of lymphoblasts or fresh lymphocytes may also
be useful diagnostic methods for CMTl A. The availability
of highly polymorphic markers similar to those demonstrated in this study from most regions of the human genome may enable the detection of segmental trisomy as
the molecular basis for other human diseases
The mechanism by which a duplication could result in
the CMT phenotype is unknown, but possible mechanisms
for the disease phenotype include the following: first, overexpression of one or more genes in the region (dosage
effect); second, interruption of a candidate gene at the
duplication junction leading either to an altered gene product with a dominant deleterious effect or to an absence of
the gene product, thus resulting in decreased levels; third,
occurrence of a stable dominant mutation in one of the
duplicated candidate genes that results in a gene product
with a deleterious effect; and fourth, a change in the physical location of the gene(s) within the duplication region,
leading to altered regulation of gene expression, secondary to a position effect. The human gene for the b subunit
of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor has recently
been mapped to the 17p11.2-p12
region (Beeson et al.,
1990). This receptor plays an important role in signal transduction at the neuromuscular junction. Using a highly polymorphic marker within this gene (OS1 -f3GT), we have demonstrated that it lies outside the duplication region (data
not shown). However, the genes for the subunits of the
neuronal acetylcholine receptor tend to locate in clustered
arrays (Boulter et al., 1990). It is thus possible that altered
expression of one or more of such receptor subunits could
result in an altered stoichiometry of the subunits and lead
to CMT.
The mechanism by which theduplication
mutation arose
is unknown. De novo mutations that include deletions and
duplications have been observed in the proximal region of
the short arm of chromosome 17 (Smith et al., 1986; Stratton et al., 1986; Magenis et al., 1986). It is possible that
the same recombination mechanisms that result in microdeletion on one chromosome homolog can result in duplication on the reciprocal homolog. Recent studies on chromosomal duplications
in Escherichia coli and humans
have demonstrated that duplication junctions occur in regions containing repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP)
sequences (Shyamala et al., 1990) as well as near Alu
sequences (Kornreich et al., 1990; Devlin et al., 1990).

Mutations at the Bar locus in Drosophila melanogaster are
gain of function and semidominant (Lindsley and Zimm,
1985) and are frequently associated with a tandem duplication of chromosome bands 16Al-A7 (Bridges, 1936).
Recent molecular analysis has suggested that there is a
transposable element (B104) located at the duplication
junction. It has been proposed that this element is involved
in the generation of the duplication. DNA sequencing analysis of the junctions of the B104 element support a model
whereby the duplication is generated by a recombination
event between two 8104 elements, one in 16Al and the
other in 16A7 (Tsubota et al., 1989). A detailed analysis of
the CMTlA duplicated region, particularly the duplication
junctions, in CMTlA patients of varied ethnic origin may
clarify the molecular mechanism for generating this dupliSome probable animal models for CMT are the mouse
mutants trembler (Tr, dominant) (Falconer, 1951) and
trembler-J (TrJ, semidominant) (Green, 1989). These mice
exhibit a demyelinating
neuropathy with decreased NCV
similar to CMTl, and their mutations map to mouse chromosome 11, which is syntenic with human chromosome
17. It will be interesting to determine if the candidate disease locus is duplicated in these mice as in humans. Determination of the molecular basis of CMTlA will be possible
by definition of the limits of the duplicated region, facilitated by identifying overlapping genomic clones that span
the region and identifying candidate expressed sequences
that map within the duplication. Ultimate confirmation of
this finding may require expression of the candidate mutated region in transgenic mice and observation of the
phenotype.
Experimental

Procedures

Clinical Evaluation
and Sampling
of Families
All available at-risk members of pedigrees
were subjected to a thorough clinical and electrophysiological
examination.
In pedigree HOW,
NCVs were initially determined
only for clinically affected individuals.
Further evaluation
indicated that the clinically unaffected
individuals
l-13,1-37,
and l-38 had abnormal NCVs; therefore, thediseasestatus
of these individuals is different from that reported in the original pedigree (Pate1 et al., 1990a). In all other pedigrees
at-risk individuals,
whether clinically affected or unaffected, had motor NCVs determined.
Diagnosis of CMTl wasestablished
by slowed median and ulnar motor
NCVs bilaterally (<40 m/s). A single normal motor NCV of the peroneal
nerve excluded the diagnosis of CMTI in patients 5 years or older.
Blood was collected
from each participating
family member, under
informed consent,
and used to establish
EBV-transformed
lymphoblasts (Anderson
and Gusella, 1984) and for isolating high molecular
weight DNA (Miller et al., 1988). The variable numbers
of tandem
repeat locus YNH24 (D2S44) (Nakamura
et al., 1987a, 198713) in addition to the marker loci used in linkage analysis, were used to check
parental origins for each individual in the seven pedigrees in Figure 1.
Some parental exclusions
were detected: these individuals were not
incorporated
in the linkage analysis.
Linkage Analysis
The chromosome
17~ markers comprise 17 standard RFLPs and were
detected using nine DNA probes and Southern analysis as previously
described (Pate1 et al., 1990a, 19906). The DNA probe FcTRll (chromosome lq) was studied by Southern analysis to exclude linkage to chromosome 1. LOD score analysis used two-point or multipoint methods
(Morton, 1956; Ott, 1985; Lathrop and Lalouel, 1988) and the computer
programs
LINKAGE version 4.7 (Lathrop and Lalouel, 1988) and CRIMAP version 2.4 (Donis-Keller

as were the alleles at RMl 1 -GT. For markers with five

for individual pedigrees and pooled. The maximum likelihood estimate of 8 (6) and the
peak LOD score (Z = Z(6)) were estimated
using the ILINK program
in LINKAGE. Linkage was accepted if the LOD score was 3 or greater;
the exclusion
criterion was a LOD score of -2 (odds 1OO:l against
linkage) at a specified recombination
value. Approximate
95% confidence intervals on location were calculated
by including all points on
a map that have LOD scores at most one unit lower than the peak LOD
score (Conneally et al., 1985).
The x2 test of homogeneity
(Morton, 1956) with 4 degrees of freedom
was calculated for each of the eight 17~ DNA polymorphisms
in Table
1. The x2 values ranged from 0.00 to 7.14 and were not statistically
significant
(P > 0.10).
The order between the proximal chromosome
17~ markers was
established
by analyses of these markers in the CEPH (Centre d’Etude
du Polymorphisme
Humain, Paris, France [Dausset, 1986)) reference
families, and from analyses of somatic cell hybrids (Pate1 et al., 199Oa).
The distances
between adjacent markers
in centimorgans
were estimated from the CEPH panel (P. Fain, personal communication,
1991)
except for 1517, whose distance from YNM67-R5 was estimated from
thefiveCMTlA
kindredsdescribed
in this paper. The map is as follows:
LEW301-2.6
CM-[YNM67-R5,
1516]-1.8
CM-[AlO-41,
S6.1-HB2]1.3 CM-VAW409-4.2
CM-1517-7.5
CM-MYH2,
where [
] indicates markers for which the order is unknown.
CRI-MAP is more
efficient in likelihood calculations
than LINKAGE, since it ignores population allele frequencies
and the genotypes
of specific individuals
in
analyses,
In comparing
the results of identical analyses in these five
kindreds using both CRI-MAP and LINKAGE, a 20% information loss
was observed
for two-point
LOD scores
but only a 4% loss for
multipoint LOD scores. For efficient calculations,
only CRI-MAP was
used for multipoint analysis.
Detection
of (GT). Polymorphic
Markers
and Genotype
Determination
(GT). repeat sequences
were identified by Southern hybridization
of
dot blots of the plasmid or cosmid DNA to synthetic
nick-translated
poly(dC-dA).poly(dG-dl)
(Pharmacia)
using [@P]dCTP
(New England
Nuclear). Hybridizations
were performed
in 1 M NaCI, 1% SDS, 10%
dextran sulfate at 65OC, and the filters were washed at room temperature in 2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS. A (GT), repeat sequence
was identified
in an 11 kb EcoRl fragment cloned in pUCl8 (VAW409Rl).
A 250 bp
Haelll fragment contained the (GT), repeat and was further subcloned
into pTZ19 (pRM1 l-GT) and sequenced
by the dideoxy chain-termination method (Sanger et al., 1977) using the Sequenase
Kit (United
States Biochemical
Corporation).
The repeat sequence
present
in
pRM1 l-GT was (TA),(GT),,(AT),.
Analysis of 83 unrelated individuals
identified at least eight different alleles, ranging in size from 153 bp to
167 bp, with an observed
heterozygosity
of 74%.
For PCR amplification
either the GT strand (CAGAACCACAAAATGTCTTGCATTC)
or CA strand (GGCCAGACAGACCAGGCTCTGC)
oligonucleotide
primer flanking the (GT), repeat sequence
was endlabeled at 37OC in a 15 ~1 reaction volume containing 1.2 9M primer,
100 &i of [y-32P]ATP at 6000 Cilmmol, 1 x One Phor-All Plus buffer
(Pharmacia),
and 10 U of polynucleotide
kinase (Pharmacia).
The ki-

nase was inactivated
at 65OC for 10 min and the primer used directly
in the PCR reaction (0.4 frl per reaction).
PCR was performed
using
standard conditions in a 25 ~1 reaction volume in a mixture containing
1 PM each oligodeoxynucleotide
primer, 250 NM each dATP, dCTP,
dGTP, and dTTP, 2.5 hl of 10x PCR buffer (500 mM KCI, 120 mM
Tris-HCI
[pH 8.0],1.5 mM MgCI,, and 0.01% gelatin), 0.63 U of AmpliTaq (Cetus) DNA polymerase,
and 0.4 pl of end-labeled
GT primer
reaction mix. The amplification
conditions were an initial denaturation
at 94OC for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94OC denaturation
for 1
min, 55OC annealing for 1 min, and 72OC extension
for 2 min in an
automated
thermal cycler (Perkin-ElmerlCetus).
Reaction products
(1.5 ~1) were mixed with 2 al of formamide stop solution (United States
Biochemical
Corporation)
and electrophoresed
in a 8% polyacrylamide DNA sequencing
gel at 40 W for 3.5 hr. Gels were dried and
autoradiographed
for 2-12 hr by exposure
to Kodak XARQ film at

-70%.
Southern
Analysis
and Dosage Determination
Samples (5.5 frg) of genomic DNA were digested with 3-4 U of the
appropriate restriction endonuclease
under conditions specified by the
manufacturer.
A 0.5 pg aliquot was examined by gel electrophoresis
to determine
completeness
of digestion.
The digested DNAs were
electrophoresed
in a 1% agarose gel in 1 x TAE buffer (40 mM TrisHCI [pH 8.51, 40 mM sodium acetate, 2 mM EDTA) for *I6 hr. The
DNA was transferred
to a nylon membrane (Sureblot, Oncor) and hybridized to the probe after preassociation
of repeats as described
previously(Patel
et al., 1990b). Dosageof alleles wasdetermined
by visual
inspection of autoradiographs
and comparison
of the intensity of one
polymorphic
allele to the other within each lane. Alternatively,
such
comparisons
were made on autoradiographs
using a densitometer
(LKB Ultrascan) or by direct quantitation of radioactivity
in the polymorphic alleles on the nylon membrane
using the Betascope
analyzer
(Betagen) (Sullivan et al., 1987).
Allele Separation
for PCR Analysis
Samples (5 Kg) of genomic DNA from members of a nuclear family in
HOU42 were digested with Mspl and electrophoresed
in a 1% agarose
gel in 1 x TAE buffer at 20 V overnight to allow separation of 3 kb and
6 kb alleles. The gel was sliced to isolate these fractions in a minimal
volume, and the DNAwas purified using Geneclean (810101). Approximately 1130th of the isolated DNA was subjected to PCR analysis with
the RMll-GT
primers as described
before.
Construction
and Analysis
of Somatic Cell Hybrids
Somatic cell hybrids were used to separate the maternal and paternal
chromosomes
17 of individuals 42-331, 42-332, and 42-333. Hybrids
were constructed
as described
by Zoghbi et al. (1989) using a23, a
thymidine kinase-deficient
Chinese hamster cell line (Westerveld
et
al., 1971) as the rodent parent. Briefly, two 100 mm plateswere
seeded
with 10’ a23 cells per plate 16-20 hr before fusion. The cells were
washed with Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM). To a 10 ml
suspension
of 5 x 10’ lymphoblasts
in Hanks’ balanced salt solution
(GIBCO), 250 ~1 of a 1 mg/ml phytohemagglutinin
(Sigma) solution was
added. Five milliliters of this cell suspension
was added to each plate
of a23 cells, and the plates were incubated for 15 min at 37°C. The
solution was aspirated,
and 2 ml of 50% polyethylene
glycol 1500
(Eoehringer
Mannheim Biochemicals)
was spread over the surface of
the plate. After 1 min the polyethylene
glycol was aspirated,
and the
cells were washed three times with DMEM and incubated with 10 ml
of DMEM for 30 min at 37°C. The medium was aspirated and the plates
were incubated overnight
with 10 ml of DMEM with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS). Hybrids were selected by growth in DMEM containing
10% FCS, 0.1 mM hypoxanthine,
0.001 mM aminopterin, and 0.01 mM
thymidine.
Hybrids were isolated with cloning rings IO-14 days later
and transferred
to 24-well microtiter plates.
For analysis of the hybrids, cells from each confluent well were
collected and lysed by boiling in 30 yl of 1 x PCR buffer. Three microliters of the lysate was used for PCR amplification
with primers flanking
a (GT), repeat (OSI-8GT)
at the locus for the gene for the 8 subunit
of the nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor in 17~11.2. The sequence of the
GT strand primer is AACTTTACTACAGGAGTTACACCC,
and that of
the CA strand primer is CTCGAGCCCCCGCATTCAAGAA.
The PCR
was conducted
as described
before using 3 ~1 of the cell lysate or

genomic DNA from the individual patients. The successful
of the chromosome
17 homologs in hybrids was noted by
of the (GT), allele in each hybrid to that of the correspondparent.

PFGE
Lymphoblasts
were used for preparation
of plugs as described
(Herrmann et al., 1987). Briefly, exponentially
growing lymphoblasts
were
collected and counted using a hemacytometer.
The cells were resuspended at 1 x 10’lml in lysis buffer I(O.l M EDTA, 0.02 M NaCI, 0.01
M Tris-HCI
[pH 7.8]), and an equal volume of 1% lncert agarose (FMC
Corporation)
was added. The mixture was aliquoted into plug molds
kept on ice. The plugs were suspended
in lysis buffer II (lysis buffer I
with 1.0% N-lauroylsarcosine
and 2 mg/ml proteinase
K). The digestion was carried out at 50°C for 48 hr. The plugs were dialyzed extensively against 10 mM Tris-HCI
(pH 7.5) 1 mM EDTA. Approximately
one-fifth of each plug (4 ug of DNA) was digested with ~20 U of restriction endonuclease
in a 150 PI volume and electrophoresed
in a
CHEFII-DR
PFGE apparatus
(Bio-Rad) for 24 hr in 0.5 x TBE buffer
using pulse times of 50-90 s ramp at 200 V. The gel was transferred
to a nylon membrane,
and the Southern blot was hybridized
with the
probe VAW409R3 as described above with the exception that 0.5 mgl
ml human placental DNA was used for preassociation
of repeats in the
probe.
FISH
Two-color FISH was performed
as described previously
(Trask et al.,
1991). Briefly, VAW409Rl
and VAW409R3 were combined and biotinylated using a nick translation kit (BRL). The cosmid cl516 was similarly labeled with digoxigenin
(Boehringer
Mannheim).
The probes
were mixed and hybridized
to nuclei from post-log phase but unsynchronized
lymphoblasts
fixed on slides after hypotonic
swelling and
methanol-acetic
acid fixation. After hybridization,
hybridization
sites
of biotinylated
and digoxigenin-labeled
probes were labeled with
Texas red and fluorescein,
respectively,
by sequential
incubation of
slides, alternated
with wash steps, in avidin-Texas
red; biotinylated
goat anti-avidin
and sheep anti-digoxigenin
antibodies;
and avidinTexas red and fluoresceinated
rabbit anti-sheep IgG antibodies. Slides
were viewed on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope
(100x
magnification)
through a dual band-pass filter (Omega, Erattleboro,
VT), which allows
fluorescein
and Texas red to be viewed simultaneously.
Slides were
coded before analysis. Nuclei were scored randomly for the number
of red and green hybridization
sites on each chromosome.
Photographs of representative
nuclei were taken on 3M Scotch 640T color
slide film (15-20 s exposures).
