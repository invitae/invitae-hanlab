ABSTRACT
the likely basis for inactivity of the tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1)
from a patient with tyrosinase-negative oculocutaneous albinism. A single base (thymine) was inserted in exon 5 of the
tyrosinase gene following codon 471 in the putative transmembrane coding region. This insertion caused a shift in the reading
frame of 19 amino acids at the 3' end and introduced a
premature termination signal that would be expected to truncate the protein by 21 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus.
The albino tyrosinase was not recognized by antibodies directed
to the carboxyl terminus of tyrosinase. Furthermore, as shown
by gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitated protein, the
tyrosinase was =3 kDa smaller than normal. Similar immunoprecipitation data were obtained when cloned normal and
mutant tyrosinases were expressed in COS-1 cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Cultures. Tyrosinase-negative albino melanocytes
from the proband and normal human control melanocytes
were cultured from shaved skin biopsy samples as described
(15). The melanocytes were grown in Ham's F-10 medium
(American Biorganics, North Tonawanda, NY) supplemented with penicillin (200 units/ml), streptomycin (100
,ug/ml), L-glutamine (1 mM), newborn calf serum (2.5%), and
calf serum (2.5%) (both from GIBCO), phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate (85 nM, Chemsyn Science Laboratories, Lenexa,
KS), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.1 mM, Sigma), insulin (5
,ug/ml), and bovine pituitary extract (40 .g/ml). Jurkat and
MOLT-3 are T-cell leukemia lines and were cultured in RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%)
streptomycin (100 ,.g/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml).
COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium containing fetal bovine serum (10o), penicillin (100
units/ml), and streptomycin (100 ,ug/ml).
Southern Blot Hybridization. High molecular weight human
genomic DNA was prepared as described (8). DNA digested
with Taq I restriction endonuclease was electrophoresed in
1% agarose gels at 4°C, transferred to GeneScreenPlus membrane (DuPont/NEN) as described by Southern (16), and
hybridized to 32P-labeled normal human tyrosinase cDNA
Pmel34 (8) at 65°C. The blot was then washed twice in 2X
standard saline citrate (SSC) for 5 min at room temperature,
twice at 65°C in 2x SSC/1% SDS for 30 min, and twice with
0.1 x SSC for 30 min at room temperature. The blot was
autoradiographed for 2 days at -80°C.
RNA Blot Analysis. Poly(A)+ RNA samples from normal
human melanocytes, the proband tyrosinase-negative albino
melanocytes, human melanotic and amelanotic melanoma
cells, and Jurkat and MOLT-3 were fractionated in formaldehyde/1.4% agarose denaturing gels (17) and transferred to
GeneScreenPlus membrane. The blot was hybridized to
nick-translated normal human tyrosinase cDNA Pmel34 in
50% (vol/vol) formamide/10o (wt/vol) dextran sulfate/1 M
sodium chloride/1% (wt/vol) SDS containing 100 ,ug of
sheared salmon sperm DNA per milliliter.
Construction and Screening of cDNA Library. The normal
tyrosinase cDNA library was constructed and screened as
described (8). A cDNA library was also prepared from
poly(A)+ RNA derived from the proband's tyrosinasenegative albino melanocytes and cloned in a Agtll cloning

Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a syndrome that encompasses a group of individual inborn errors, each inherited as
a Mendelian autosomal recessive trait and characterized by
the absence or near absence of melanin pigmentation in the
skin, hair, and eyes. To date, depending upon the classification method, there are 8 or 11 recognized forms of OCA (1,
2). No melanin is produced in the absence of tyrosinase, a
copper-containing glycoprotein (3). Tyrosinase (monophenol, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine:oxygen oxidoreductase,
EC 1.14.18.1) catalyzes three reactions in the melanin biosynthetic pathway: hydroxylation of L-tyrosine to 3,4dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (dopa), oxidation of dopa to
dopaquinone, and oxidation of 5,6-dihydroxyindole to indole-5,6-quinone (3-6). OCA is a serious disorder since the
deficiency of melanin produces visual difficulties such as
nystagmus, strabismus, photophobia, and astigmatism. The
cutaneous photosensitivity results in a predisposition of the
skin to cancer (1). The most severe form of OCA is tyrosinase-negative albinism, in which, by definition, tyrosinase
activity is not detected in the hair bulbs (7). The incidence of
this form of OCA in the United States is estimated at 1:39,000
in the Caucasian population and 1:28,000 in the Black population (1).
We have isolated a human tyrosinase cDNA (8) and used
it to show that the tyrosinase gene is present as a single copy
per haploid genome at the TYR locus on human chromosome
11 (9) and at the c locus on mouse chromosome 7 (8). The
availability of tyrosinase cDNA enabled us and others to
identify mutations in human and murine tyrosinase-negative
albinos (10-14). In this report, we show a mutation in the
tyrosinase gene of a tyrosinase-negative albino patient that

vector (18, 19). The latter library was screened with two
different 32P-labeled oligomers, which represented the 5' and
3' ends of normal tyrosinase cDNA.
DNA Sequencing. Restriction fragments of cDNA from
normal human melanocytes were subcloned into a M13
vector for sequence determination by the dideoxy chaintermination method (20). The albino tyrosinase cDNAs were
sequenced by the double-stranded sequencing method (21)
using various oligonucleotides corresponding to different
regions of the tyrosinase cDNA. The 3' region of the Bgl
II-EcoRI fragment of the albino tyrosinase cDNA was subcloned into the M13mp8 BamHI/EcoRI site and sequenced
by the dideoxy chain-termination method.
Tyrosinase Assay. Tyrosinase activity was determined in
anagen hair bulbs as described by King and Witkop (22).
Tyrosinase activity in melanocyte extracts was measured by
the method of Pomerantz (23); 1 unit of enzyme is defined as
the activity that catalyzes the oxidation of 1 .umol of tyrosine
per minute.
Immunoprecipitation. Melanocytes in culture were deprived of methionine and cysteine for 4 hr and pulsed for 15
min with Trans35S-label (500 ,Ci/ml; ICN). The cells were
lysed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: pH 7.4)/1% (vol/
vol) Nonidet P40/0.1% (wt/vol) SDS/0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and subjected to immunoprecipitation
with either polyclonal anti-tyrosinase antibodies raised in
rabbits against hamster tyrosinase (a-tyr) (15) or with antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide spanning the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids of mouse tyrosinase (a-PEP7,
a gift from V. J. Hearing, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD; ref. 24). Twelve of these 15 amino acids are
identical in murine and human tyrosinase. Immune complexes were resolved by PAGE and fluorographed at -75°C
for 1 or 2 days (a-tyr, a-PEP7, respectively).
Transfection of COS-1 Cells with Normal and Albino Tyrosinase cDNA. COS-1 cells were grown to 30-50% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described
above and transfected by the DEAE-dextran method (25)
with 4 ,ug of plasmid DNA containing normal and albino
tyrosinase cDNA inserts. Normal tyrosinase cDNA clone
Pmel34 lacks nucleotide A of the first ATG codon (8).
Therefore, we constructed a new clone, Pmel34A, which
contained the initiation ATG codon, by replacing the 5'-end
EcoRI-HgiAI fragment of Pmel34 with the corresponding
fragment containing the first ATG codon. This construct and
the albino cDNA were ligated to expression vector pXM (26)
and used in the transfection of COS-1 cells.
Forty-four hours after transfection, the cells were incubated for 4 hr in methionine/cysieine-free medium and pulsed
with Trans35S-label (500 ,uCi/ml) for 15 min. The cultures
were washed twice with PBS, harvested by scraping, and
lysed in PBS/1.0% Nonidet P-40/0.1% SDS with protease
inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM; leupeptin,
pepstatin, chymostatin, and bestatin, each 1 ,Lg/ml) for 2 hr
on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min.
The supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation as
described above.

RESULTS
Taq I Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism of the
Proband and His Parents. The proband is a 1.5-year-old
Caucasian boy with tyrosinase-negative OCA. His parents,
both Caucasians of Irish descent, are of normal phenotype
but are heterozygotes with respect to tyrosinase activity as
determined by the hair-bulb tyrosinase assay (22). Southern
blot analysis of the genomic DNA of this family revealed Taq
I polymorphic fragments of either 2.4 kb (father and child) or
2.8 kb (mother and child) and four nonpolymorphic fragments
of 0.6, 0.9, 1.4, and 5.0 kb (all three) (Fig. 1). This polymor-

phism does not correlate with OCA, since unrelated normal
individuals have the same frequency of polymorphism at
these two alleles (ref. 27 and unpublished data). However,
this analysis indicates that the tyrosinase gene of the proband
is not associated with deletions or rearrangements detectable
at this level.
RNA Blot Analysis. To determine whether tyrosinase was

transcribed normally, Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA from
the proband melanocytes were compared with those from
normal melanocytes (Fig. 2). There was no difference in size
or abundance of the proband tyrosinase mRNA relative to the
tyrosinase mRNA from normal melanocytes or melanoma
cells, which suggests that at this level as well there were no
major defects of transcription.

in the Agtll cloning vector (18, 19). The cDNA library was
screened with two oligonucleotide probes, representing the
first and fourth exons of the tyrosinase gene to avoid isolating
cDNAs of alternatively spliced RNA (28). From 300,000
plaques of recombinant phages screened, 8 independent
clones hybridized to both probes. The cDNA inserts varied
in size from 1.4 to 2 kb. Sequencing of five of these clones by
a double-stranded-DNA sequencing method (21), using various oligonucleotide primers spanning different regions of the
tyrosinase cDNA, showed that the clones were full-length.
The albino nucleotide sequence was compared to that of
Pmel34 (8) and to other cDNAs spanning the 5' and 3'
portions of tyrosinase. Fig. 3 presents the sequence of
Pmel34A, the corrected version of tyrosinase cDNA Pmel34
(8). The assignment of the signal sequence is based on
tyrosinase protein sequence information (29). The mature
tyrosinase is composed of 511 amino acids with seven potential glycosylation sites (Fig. 3). The albino tyrosinase
sequence differs from Pmel34A by five nucleotide substitutions and one insertion. The substitutions were detected at
nucleotide positions 498, 575, 923, 1205, and 1484, counted
from the A of the initiation codon ATG. These substitutions
would result in amino acid changes indicated at positions 148,
174, 290, 384, and 477. They can be regarded as polymorphism. However, an insertion occurred at the putative transmembrane region, where a T residue was found between
nucleotides 1467 and 1468 after codon 471 (Fig. 4). This
mutation alters the reading frame and introduces a premature
termination signal, TGA (nucleotide positions 1528-1530)
after amino acid 490 (Figs. 3 and 4). This mutation would be
expected to result in tyrosinase that differs from the normal
enzyme in the 19 amino acids at its carboxyl terminus and that
lacks 21 carboxyl-terminal amino acids.
Immunoprecipitation of Tyrosinase with Anti-Tyrosinase
Antibodies. The predicted structural alteration due to the T
insertional mutation was corroborated by immunoprecipitation studies. The albino tyrosinase immunoprecipitated with
anti-tyrosinase antibodies (a-tyr) had faster electrophoretic
mobility in polyacrylamide gels, with an estimated size 3 kDa
smaller than the normal tyrosinase (Fig. 5 Left). Antibodies
that recognize the carboxyl terminus of tyrosinase (a-PEP7;
ref. 24) did not immunoprecipitate the albino tyrosinase (Fig.
5 Left). These results indicate that the tyrosinase of our
proband has a major defect at the carboxyl terminus. The
same results were obtained with tyrosinase immunoprecipitated from C(S-1 cells transiently expressing normal or
albino tyrosinase cDNA. Anti-tyrosinase antibodies immunoprecipitated tyrosinase from both normal and albino
cDNA-transfected cells, with the albino tyrosinase again
displaying faster mobility, and a-PEP7 failed to immunoprecipitate the albino tyrosinase (Fig. 5 Right). Untransfected
and pXM (vector)-transfected COS-1 cells did not produce

DISCUSSION
Our observations support the conclusion that the single base
insertion in the putative transmembrane region of this albino
tyrosinase produces a protein that is altered in its carboxyl
terminus and renders the enzyme inactive. The eight isolated
tyrosinase cDNA clones have the same T insertion, and we
could not detect a-PEP7-immunoprecipitable tyrosinase
even after long fluorographic exposure (5 days, data not
shown). Ifthe proband were heterozygous for the T insertion,
one should detect "50% of the tyrosinase with the a-PEP7
antibodies. This result may indicate that both alleles of the
proband harbor the same mutation. The other alternative is
that one allele produces no mRNA or an unstable mRNA,
since the parents were unrelated. We could not find differences in the mRNA levels of the albino and normal controls.
However, tyrosinase is an inducible enzyme (30), and the
components of the medium, such as phorbol ester, alter the
level of tyrosinase (15). Therefore, the level of expression of
tyrosinase in the cultured melanocytes does not necessarily
reflect the situation in vivo.
The mutation observed by us is different from the mutation
reported by Tomita et al. (12), where a single base C insertion
in exon 2 of an OCA individual caused a shift of the reading
frame and introduced a premature termination signal after
amino acid 298. In that case, it was not demonstrated that the
albino melanocytes produced the predicted truncated tyrosinase. Another tyrosinase gene mutation was reported by
Giebel et al. (13) in 6 out of 30 unrelated tyrosinase-negative
albinos, where a change from C to T (CCT -- CTT) at codon
81 (codon 63 of the Pmel34A sequence, Fig. 3) would result
in a substitution of leucine for proline. This Pro -) Leu
mutation is not at any of the putative functional domains such
as the transmembrane, copper binding, or glycosylation
sequences. Nevertheless, the proline and the five amino acids
preceding it are conserved in both tyrosinase and the melanocyte-specific b-locus protein catalase B (8, 31, 32), which
indicates an important function for this domain. Spritz et al.
(14) also reported two missense substitutions in an albino:
one in one of the two putative copper binding sites and the
other in a potential glycosylation site. Whether these mutations can be held responsible for the inactivity of the enzyme(s) remains to be validated at the protein level.
The nucleotide substitutions detected at positions 498, 575,
923, 1205, and 1484 in albino tyrosinase cDNA putatively
alter the amino acids at positions 148, 174, 290, 384, and 477.
Four of these substitutions are also seen in other normal
tyrosinase sequences (refs. 14, 33, and 34; unpublished data).

The fifth, a Met -- Ile change at position 148, was not
reported before; but because of the conservative nature of the
substitution, it may represent another site of polymorphism.
The mutation observed in our proband in the putative
transmembrane domain would cause, in addition to truncation, a reduction in hydrophobicity due to the introduction of
arginine and glutamic residues and, therefore, would inter-

fere with the insertion of the protein into the melanosomal
membrane. Several peroxisomal enzymes have been shown
to have a targeting signal at the carboxyl terminus. Melanosomes are considered by some investigators to be modified
peroxisomes.f Tyrosinase shares the carboxyl-terminal SerHis-Leu peroxisomal targeting sequence with some peroxisomal enzymes (35). Therefore, if tyrosinase uses the carboxyl-terminal Ser-His-Leu as the melanosomal targeting
signal, the truncation would abolish the signal.
Our results and those of others (12-14) have shown several
kinds of mutations that can produce tyrosinase-negative
OCA. The heterogeneity of mutations at the TYR locus make
efficient prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection dependent
on the availability of a panel of probes.
