Familial defective apolipoprotein (apo) B-100
ABSTRACT
is a genetic disease that leads to hypercholesterolemia and to an
increased serum concentration of low density lipoproteins that
bind defectively to the apoB,E(LDL) receptor. The disorder
appears to result from a mutation in the gene for apoB-100.
Extensive sequence analysis of the two alleles of one subject
heterozygous for the disorder has revealed a previously unreported mutation in the codon for amino acid 3500 that results
in the substitution of glutamine for arginine. This same mutant
allele occurs in six other, unrelated subjects and in eight
affected relatives in two of these families. A partial haplotype
of this mutant apoB-100 allele was constructed by sequence
analysis and restriction enzyme digestion at positions where
variations in the apoB-100 are known to occur. This haplotype
is the same in three probands and four affected members of one
family and lacks a polymorphic Xba I site whose presence has
been correlated with high cholesterol levels. Thus, it appears
that the mutation in the codon for amino acid 3500 (CGG -+
CAG), a CG mutational "hot spot," defmes a minor apoB-100
allele associated with defective low density lipoproteins and
hypercholesterolemia.

receptor on fibroblasts in an in vitro assay (3). Studies of the
kindred of this patient indicated that the proband and affected
family members are heterozygotes and that the defect is
transmitted in a co-dominant fashion. This pattern of inheritance is consistent with the fact that each LDL particle
contains but one apoB-100 molecule (4). Thus, affected
individuals contain two LDL populations, one with defective
receptor binding capacity and the other with normal properties.
The present study concerns the molecular basis of this
disease, termed familial defective apoB-100 (3). The DNA of
the mutant allele contains a mutation that segregates with the
defective binding and the moderate cholesterolemia in the
kindred referred to above. The genomes of six unrelated
subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia contain the
same mutation in the apoB gene. The relationship of this
mutation to other genetic markers that have been used to
trace defective apoB alleles in the population is discussed.

The level of cholesterol in human plasma is to a large extent
controlled by the interaction of low density lipoproteins
(LDLs) with apoB,E(LDL) (or LDL) receptors. LDLs transport about two-thirds of the plasma cholesterol and are
removed from the circulation by the apoB,E(LDL) receptor
as a result of binding to apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100), the
protein moiety of LDL. Individuals with high LDL levels are
often predisposed to premature coronary disease. In principle, elevated LDL concentrations that result from inefficient
clearance of LDL particles by the receptor may derive either
from defects in the receptor or from defects in the ligand,
apoB-100. The former class of genetic disorder is well
established: familial hypercholesterolemia (1). Individuals
with this genetic disease may lack the apoB,E(LDL) receptor
or possess defective variants of it. However, because this
genetic defect is relatively rare and most hypercholesterolemic individuals possess apoB,E(LDL) receptors that lack
detectable defects, attention has been focused on other
possible causes of increased LDL levels. One possibility is
the presence of a mutant form of apoB-100.
A group of moderately hypercholesterolemic patients has
been shown (2) to have a reduced fractional clearance rate of
autologous LDL as compared with normal LDL. This finding
suggested that the retarded clearance resulted from a defective binding of LDL to its receptor, thereby accounting for
the high levels of LDL cholesterol. LDLs from one of these
patients exhibited defective binding to the apoB,E(LDL)

Patient Material. Plasma and leukocytes were obtained
from individuals of three families. The proband of the R.
family, G.R., had been shown to have a reduced clearance of
autologous LDL compared with homozygous normal LDL
(2). Of eight R. family members tested, four have LDLs that
bind abnormally to the apoB,E(LDL) receptor in normal
human fibroblasts (3). Two other patients (W.S. and R.N.)
were identified as probands of the S. and N. families,
respectively. These patients were found to have delayed in
vivo clearance of autologous LDL from plasma (5). Likewise,
W.S. and 4 of 15 family members tested have LDLs that
exhibit abnormal binding to normal human fibroblast apoB,E(LDL) receptors. R.N. (who was recruited into the study
by Margo Denke, Dallas, TX) also possesses LDLs that have
abnormal receptor binding. Techniques to define abnormal
binding of LDL to receptors in normal human fibroblasts
have been presented in detail elsewhere (3). DNA was
prepared by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation.
Genomic Libraries. Two libraries were prepared from G.R.
DNA in phage A. The first contained DNA partially digested
with Mbo I and ligated to arms of A FIX (Stratagene) (4 X 106
recombinants with inserts of between 9 and 22 kilobases).
The second contained DNA digested to completion with
EcoRI and inserted into A ZAP (Stratagene) (7 X 106
recombinants with inserts of between 0.1 and 10 kilobases).

RESULTS
A Mutation in the Human ApoB Gene. To identify a
mutation that could be responsible for a defect in the ability
of LDL to bind to its receptor, we examined the part of the
gene corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal half of apoB100. Lipoproteins containing apoB-48, the amino-terminal
half of apo-B100, do not bind to the apoB,E(LDL) receptor
(8); also, the epitopes of antibodies that block LDL binding
to the receptor are localized to the carboxyl-terminal onethird of the protein in a region encoded by the large 7572-bp
exon 26 (9). Since G.R. is heterozygous for the defect, only
substitutions occurring in one but not both of the patient's
two apoB alleles can be causally related to defective LDL.
Fig. 1 illustrates the positions at which differences in the
apoB-100 sequence have been reported. This information
was assembled from known DNA polymorphisms (10, 11)
together with four complete cDNA sequences (12-15), a gene
sequence (10), and several partial sequences (16, 17). All
reported variations are included, even though some may have
resulted from cloning or sequencing errors. Codons and
amino acids reported in the majority of the publications are
termed "consensus" in Fig. 1, even though the appropriateness of this designation could be contested. Likewise, codons
and amino acid residues depicted in the lower half of the
figure are referred to as variants only because they have been
reported less often. These two sequences do not represent
established haplotypes, and their relative frequencies in the
population have not been ascertained (10).
Two libraries of G.R. DNA were constructed in A vectors.
ApoB-containing clones covering the regions illustrated in
Fig. 1 were isolated. Several of the 13 subclones were
screened for differences by DNA sequencing. After extensive sequencing of multiple isolates, only one change was
detected. This alteration reflected a CGG -- CAG change in
the codon for amino acid 3500, causing a substitution of
glutamine for arginine (Fig. 2). To the best of our knowledge,
this variant has not been reported. No other previously
unreported nucleotide changes were observed. Furthermore,
none of the variant positions illustrated in Fig. 1 were shown
to be heterozygous in G.R. DNA except position 7673, the
Xba I site, which is a third-position substitution that does not
change the amino acid. An extensive sequence analysis of the
mutant allele yielded the results that are summarized in Fig.

The libraries were screened with various human apoB cDNA
probes.
DNA Sequencing. DNA from A clones was subcloned into
M13 vectors and sequenced by the Sanger dideoxynucleotide
chain-termination method (6).
Oligonucleotides. All oligonucleotides were synthesized on
an Applied Biosystems synthesizer model 380B. Those used
as primers for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or as
allele-specific oligonucleotide probes (ASOs) are listed in
Table 1. Probes were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide
kinase and [32P]ATP to 106 cpm/ng.
PCR. The PCR was used for local amplification of sections
of the human apoB gene. Reactions were conducted in an
automated Perkin-Elmer/Cetus thermal cycler by using
thermostable Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase obtained
from Cetus (7).
Xba I Polymorphism. The presence or absence of the Xba
I site at position 7673 was determined by amplifying a
segment of exon 26 from position 7591 to position 7809 by
using primers PCR1 and PCR2. Complete digestion of the
amplified band with Xba I yielded two fragments, of 136 and
82 base pairs (bp).
Msp I Polymorphism. The presence or absence of the Msp
I site at position 11,039 was determined by amplifying a
480-bp segment of exon 26 from position 10,644 to position
11,124 by using primers PCR4 and PCR6. Complete digestion
of the amplified band with Msp I yielded two fragments, of
395 and 85 bp.
Plasmids. Plasmid p46a, containing an EcoRI-EcoRI 1549bp fragment from exon 26 subcloned from the G.R. A ZAP
DNA library, represents the wild-type allele. Plasmid p43,

a third proband, R.N. (Fig. 3 Left), indicates that this subject
is also heterozygous for the same mutation. Four other
individuals with defective LDLs, who were unrelated to any
of the aforementioned, were also heterozygous for the
mutation.
Haplotype of the Mutant Allele. We wished to establish a
partial haplotype of the mutant allele, in part to determine the
extent to which other markers (e.g., the Xba I polymorphism
at position 7673) correlate with this allele. This question was
of interest because earlier studies established that the X2
allele(i.e., the allele containing the Xba I site) is associated
with higher levels of plasma cholesterol (18, 19). For this
purpose, we determined the genotype of each member of the
R. kindred and of two other hypercholesterolemic patients at
the Xba I site (the 5' side of the Arg -- Gln change) and the
Msp I site (the 3' side). For both RFLPs the genotype was
determined by digesting amplified DNA representing these
two regions with Xba I and Msp I. The results are summarized in Fig. 4. With respect to the Xba I genotype, it is clear
that the mutant allele must be X1. For example, the proband
and his two brothers are X1/X2, and the affected granddaughter is X1/X1, but the unaffected son of G.R. is X2/X2.
The genotypes of the unrelated patients R.N. and W.S. are
consistent with this view, as is the fact that the G.R. mutant
allele has the codon ACC for amino acid 2488 (i.e., X1). In
contrast, the normal allele of G.R. is X2. Although the Msp
I polymorphism proved to be less informative, the data are

2 in terms of the variant positions of Fig. 1. Sequencing of the
other G.R. allele has been less extensive, but the sequences
established at several of the variant positions conform to
published sequences. The sequence of the codon for amino
acid 3292, deduced by annealing an amplified region encompassed by PCR3 and PCR5 with oligonucleotides ASO1 and
ASO2, proved to encode aspartic acid in both alleles.
Inheritance of the Arginine/Glutamine Polymorphism. To
test whether the CGG -- CAG mutation in the codon for
amino acid 3500 segregated with defective LDLs, a family
study was undertaken. A region of the apoB gene of the R.
and S. kindreds encompassing the mutation was amplified,
and the amplified DNA was screened with ASOs. To this end,
a pair of 15-mer oligonucleotides representing the mutant and
normal alleles were synthesized: ASO3 and ASO4 (see Table
1). A third oligonucleotide probe (ASO5) within the amplified
region was used, representing a region whose sequence was
identical in both G.R. alleles. These three oligonucleotides
were used to probe the amplified DNAs in a slot blot (Fig. 3).
Two plasmid DNAs were included to evaluate the discrimination afforded by the two allele-specific probes. The results
demonstrate that the mutation segregates in members of both
families with defective LDLs and moderate hypercholesterolemia. Only affected family members carry the mutant
allele. The extent of reaction with the third oligonucleotide
complementary to positions 10,784-10,798 controls for differential amplification of each DNA. Analysis of the DNA of

DISCUSSION
A high degree of genetic polymorphism in human LDL has
been recognized since 1976, when it was established that
allotypic antibodies in the serum of multiply transfused
patients are capable of distinguishing allelic variants of LDL
(20). These allotypic variants have been shown to be closely
linked to DNA polymorphisms in the apoB gene (21).
Furthermore, comparison of five complete and several partial
published human apoB gene sequences revealed more than 60
nucleotide substitutions, the majority of which affect the
amino acid sequence of the protein (10). Our intention in the
present study was to determine whether any of these polymorphisms correlated with familial defective apoB-100.
As a result of many previous studies, two correlations
between apoB polymorphisms and abnormalities in lipoprotein metabolism have been established. Serum cholesterol
and triacylglycerol levels are higher in individuals with the
Ag(x-) epitope than in individuals with the Ag(x') epitope
(22). Furthermore, theXba I RFLP, which is in strong linkage
disequilibrium with the Ag(x) epitope, is also correlated with
serum cholesterol levels. Homozygotes with alleles that lack
the Xba I site (i.e., X1/X1) tend to have lower serum
cholesterol levels than X2/X2 homozygotes or X1/X2 heterozygotes (18, 19). This effect seems to be attributable to a
difference in the level of LDL and apoB (23). Other authors
have noted an association between the Xba I polymorphism
and myocardial infarction (24). Other RFLPs in the apoB
gene fail to correlate with abnormalities in lipid metabolism
(19).
The mutation reported here changes the codon for amino
acid 3500 and correlates with hypercholesterolemia and with

defective LDL binding to the receptor. All three familial
defective apoB-100 probands described here and all affected
members in two kindreds have this same mutation. Our most
recent data define a total of seven unrelated probands
heterozygous for this mutation, all of whom have defective
LDLs. Furthermore, all of their relatives shown to carry the
mutant allele also have LDLs that are defective in binding to
the receptor (data not shown). We have failed to detect any
other differences between the two alleles of the original
proband G.R., except for the fact that he is heterozygous for
the Xba I polymorphism at nucleotide 7673 that changes the
third position of a threonine codon. However, we have not
yet determined the complete sequence of this mutant apoB
allele. Therefore, the argument that the substitution of
glutamine for arginine at amino acid 3500 is responsible for
the defective binding of LDL to the receptor remains circumstantial. Attempts to express full-length apoB gene
constructs in cultured cells that differ only in this codon are
a logical test of this proposition.
The mutation in the codon for amino acid 3500, CGG
CAG, is an example of a potential mutational "hot spot."
Mutations at CG dinucleotides in higher animals are unusually frequent (25, 26) as a result of methylation of cytosine on
the 5' side of guanine and spontaneous deamination of
5-methylcytosine to thymine (27). In the present case the
mutation is attributable to a C T transition in the noncoding
strand. Such mutational hot spots have been reported in the
human gene for factor VIII (28). It has been estimated that the
extent of hypermutability at CG dinucleotides in the factor
VIII gene is 10- to 20-fold greater than the rate at other
positions (29). That CG dinucleotides in general are potential
mutational hot spots is suggested by the unusually high
frequency of polymorphism at a number of loci in human
DNA where CG occurs in the recognition site for certain
restriction enzymes such as Msp I and Taq I (29). In the case
of the human apoB gene, two other polymorphisms have
-*

Genetics: Soria et al.
been reported (11, 30) that result from mutations at CG
dinucleotides, both at Msp I sites. Again by analogy to the
factor VIII gene (28), these three CG dinucleotides may be
hot spots where recurrent mutations have taken place in the
human population.
The amino acid substitution at position 3500 occurs in a
region implicated in LDL binding to the apoB,E(LDL)
receptor. Although the receptor binding domain of apoB-100
has yet to be precisely defined, several lines of evidence point
to this region of the protein encoded by exon 26. Two
sequences in this region encode stretches of basic amino
acids beginning at positions 3147 and 3359, the second of
which displays some similarity to the receptor binding domain of apoE (14). Furthermore, the epitopes of several
antibodies that inhibit LDL binding to its receptor also map
to this region (31). Of particular relevance is the fact that one
of these monoclonal antibodies, MB47, can distinguish mutant from normal LDL in terms of affinity (5). The epitope of
this antibody has been localized between residues 3350 and
3506 (12). Thus, the difference in affinity is presumably
attributable to the substitution of glutamine for arginine. The
fact that this antibody can recognize a change on the surface
of LDL and also inhibit receptor binding is consistent with a
role for arginine-3500 in receptor binding. This amino acid is
located within a cluster of basic residues in apoB-100,
although its sequence does not resemble that of the receptor
binding domain of apoE.
In addition to establishing the presence of the mutation in
the codon for arginine-3500 in hypercholesterolemic subjects
and their relatives, the haplotype of the mutant allele must be
defined. This is important because the human apoB gene is so
polymorphic: at least 14 haplotypes exist at different frequencies in various populations (32). At present, our information is
limited to the region of exon 26 corresponding to amino acids
2488-3611 [i.e., between the polymorphic Xba I site (18, 19) and
a polymorphic Msp I site (11)]. Of particular interest is the fact

that the mutant alleles of all three probands examined contain
the X1 variant of the Xba I polymorphism. Thus, although the
association between the mutation at position 3500 and the Xba
I polymorphism has yet to be studied in a large number of
subjects, it would appear unlikely that previous studies reporting association between the X2 genotype and high cholesterol
levels simply reflect the mutation discussed here. On the
contrary, the mutation at position 3500 appears to define a
minor X1 allele that segregates with defective LDL and moderate

hypercholesterolemia.
