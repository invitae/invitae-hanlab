Summary:
We have analyzed the exon 9, 13, 14, 15, and 16 of cardiac
l3 myosin heavy chain gene in 96 Japanese patients with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy

The analysis revealed a sequence variation
of the exon 16 in
one patient.
The sequence variation
of a G to C transversion
with
replacement
of Asn by Lys at the codon
615 was confirmed
by
sequencing
and by dot-blot

Because the missense mutation was found at the

this

suggested to be a cause of hypertrophic

Twelve primers flanking exons 9, 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the

in a DNA

based on the reported sequences of normal human cardiac p

Two additional oligonucleotide

be analyzed

would facilitate
the

RESULTS

AND

DISCUSSION

Ninty-six
patients were analyzed for mutaions in the exons 9, 13,
14, and 15 of the cardiac l3 MHC gene by the PCR-DCP analysis and no
unusual DNA fragment due to sequence variation was detected (data not
shown).
Analyzing
the exon 16 in tot (Figure la), in the 5’ half (Figure
lb), and in the 3’ half (Figure lc), normal subjects showed several slowmigrating
DNA fragments
(single-stranded
DNAs)
and a fast-migrating
DNA fragment
(double-stranded
DNA).
These slow-migrating
fragments
were thought
to represent
the exon 16-specific
single-stranded
DNAs,
but not the non-specific
coamplification
products,
because more than
one tertiary structure could be generated from one single-stranded
DNA
fragment
under the specified
condition,
as was observed in the other
genes (13-16).
One patient
with HCM showed an additional
slowmigrating
DNA
fragment
representing
single
strand
conformation
polymorphism
(22) (Figure
la, lane 1 and Figure lc, lane 1) and an
additional
fast-migrating
DNA
fragment
representing
a mismatched
hybrid DNA (23) (Figure lc, lane l), suggesting that the patient had a
sequence variation
in the 3’ half of this exon.

fatal prognosis,
while the disease-related
deaths were less frequent with the 606Va1 to Met mutation (8).
It is of
interest to note that the 584Gly
residue is completely
conserved
in
myosins from amoeba to humans while the 606Va1 is less conserved
(Figure 4). Thus the 5*4Gly to Arg mutation would be more deleterious
than the 606val to Met mutation.
In this respect, it is worth noting that
the 615Lys or a similar residue in nature, Arg, is conserved in myosins
from birds to humans and that the residue is replaced by Asn, that is
the same replacement
found in our Japanese patient, in nematodes
and
dictiosterium
(Figure 4). It is therefore possible that the 615Lys to Asn
mutation
may not be related with a poor prognosis,
although the small
number of family members of the patient did not allow us to test the
possibility.
In conclusion,
we found a patient with HCM who had a missense
mutation in the exon 16 of cardiac j3 MHC gene. This is the first report
of the mutant cardiac p MHC gene in a non-Caucasian
patient with HCM.
We could not detect any mutations in the exons 9, 13, 14, 15, and I6 in
95 other patients with HCM by using the PCR-DCP
