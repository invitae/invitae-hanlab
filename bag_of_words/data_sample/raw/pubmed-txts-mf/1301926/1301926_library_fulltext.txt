We report the biochemical and molecular characterizationof two new transthyretin (TTR) variants in
two Italian families with hereditary amyloidosis. Both families presented neuropathy and cardiomyopathy but they differ in other clinical features. These TTR variants were previously detected by
isoelectric focusing (IEF); one is a neutral TTR variant and the other one is basic. By protein and D N A
analysis the neutral variant was found to have a substitution of an alanine for a threonine residue at
position 49 (TTR Ala-49) of the polypeptide chain. The basic variant has a glutamine residue replacing
glutamate at position 89 (TTR Gln-89). o 1992 WiIey-Liss, Inc.

INTRODUCTION
The transthyretin ( TTR) related hereditary
amyloidoses (HA) are dominant diseases characterized by the deposition of amyloid mainly composed of TTR fibrils. In most cases the TTR in
amyloid fibrils has a point mutation. Different
variants are associated with different forms of amyloidosis since the organs involved in the amyloid
deposition are variable. In most cases there is amyloid deposition in the peripheral nerves causing
familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) (Saraiva, 1991); in others the amyloid deposits preferably in the heart (familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy-FAC) or into the vitreous body (Saraiva
et al., 1992). The distinction of these forms of HA
is difficult due to the coexistence of multiple organs involved in the disease.
The most frequent variant associated with neuropathy has a substitution of methionine for valine
at position 30 of the polypeptide chain, TTR Met30 (MIM 176300.0001). This TTR variant has
been found in families from different countries:
Portugal, Japan, Sweden, Greece, Italy, Ireland,

and Brazil. Other TTR variants have been discovered in recent years (Saraiva e t al., 1992). Isoelectric focusing has been used as a screening method
of TTR variants in the sera of individuals from
families with HA (Altland et al., 1987). By this
method two Italian families were found to have
two new previously undescribed TTR variants (Saraiva et al., 1988). In one of them a neutral variant was detected whereas the other one presented
a basic TTR variant. In both families there was a
late onset of both neuropathy and cardiomyopathy.
We report the biochemical and molecular analyses of these families, which started with the study
of the primary structure of the protein by tryptic
peptide mapping and amino acid sequencing were
followed by the definition of the molecular defect
by DNA analysis.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Families
The two different Italian families with HA,
both from Sicily, were previously characterized by
isoelectric focusing (IEF) (Altland et al., 1987;
Saraiva et al., 1988). In at least two members of
each family amyloidosis was confirmed by skin or
nerve biopsy (Salvi et al., 1990).

TTR neutral variant family
Three patients have been observed with a long
follow-up (more than 4 years). The disease starts in
the 5th decade with the appearance of vitreous
opacities followed, several years later, by polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy (Salvi et al., 1991).
We studied 11 individuals from this kindred, including two patients and their asymptomatic offspring.
TTR basic variant family
Three patients presented a carpal tunnel syndrome as initial clinical manifestation of the disease. Many years later it was followed by polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy responsible in one
patient for intractable heart failure and death
(Salvi et al., 1990). We analysed 12 individuals
belonging to this kindred, three patients and nine
asymptomatic subjects.
TTR was isolated from the plasma and DNA
from peripheral blood collected from the individuals.
Peptide Mapping and Sequence Analysis
Comparative tryptic peptide mapping of the patient's plasma TTR and normal TTR was performed by HPLC under similar conditions described previously (Saraiva et al., 1990).
Abnormal peptides were collected and sequenced
on an Applied Biosystems model 470A gas-phase
sequencer.
DNA Amplification
Exons 2, 3, and 4 of the TTR gene were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using
the method of Saiki et al. (1985) with appropriate
flanking primers for the region of interest. The
primers used for the amplification of exon 2 were
2A
(5'-GTTAACTTCTCACGTGTCTT-3' )

and 2B (5'-AAGTCCTGTGGGAGGGTTCT-3') with cycles of 1' at 92"C, 2' at 50"C, and
3' at 72°C. For the exon 3 the primers used were
3A (5' TCCTCCATGCGTAACTTAAT 3') and
3B
(5' -ACTGTGCATTTCCTGGAATG-3')
with cycles of 1' at 92"C, 2' at 55"C, and 3 ' at

72°C. Primers for the amplification of exon 4 were

4A (5'-CACGTTTTTCGGGCTCTGGTCG-3')
and 4B (5'-GAAATCCCATCCCTCGTCCTTC-3') and the amplification cycles were 1' at
92"C, 1' at 60"C, and 1' at 72°C (Almeida et al.,
1990).
DNA Sequencing
Each exon of the TTR gene was amplified asymetrically with 5 pmol of biotinylated primer A and
100 pmol of primer B. The amplified DNA was
linked to avidin-agarose (Mitchell et al., 1989).
T h e slurry was applied to a Sephadex G-50 column
and the amplified strand (antisense) was eluted
with NaOH 0.2 M; after neutralization with ammonium acetate 5 M, the single-strand DNA was
precipitated with ethanol and diluted with 20 p1of
TE. Seven microliters of the single strand DNA
was sequenced with 10 pmol of primer A using
Sequenase version 2.0 (USB) with [a-32P]dATP.
The sequencing gel was exposed to X-ray film for
24 hr.

A S 0 Hybridization
One-third of the amplification mixture was denatured with NaOH, neutralized, and dotted onto
a Zeta probe membrane (Bio-Rad). The A S 0
probes employed for the neutral variant were normal (Thr-49), 5'-TATAGGAAAACCAGTGAGT-3 ', and mutant (Ala-49), 5' -AETCACTGGCTTTCCTATA-3'. The probes were labeled
with [y-32P]ATP by the T4 kinase reaction for 30
min at 37°C. Hybridization with AS0 probes was
carried out at 30"C, followed by washes under
stringent conditions at 55°C (Almeida e t al.,
1990). T h e blots were then exposed to X-ray film
for 2-4 hr. The A S 0 probes for the basic variant
were normal (Glu-89), 5'CCATTCCATGAGCATGCAG-3' and mutant (Gln-89)) 5 ' -CCATTCCATCAGCATGCAG-3'. The conditions of
hybridization were the same as described for the
neutral variant except that the washing temperature was 53°C.

RESULTS

TTR was isolated from the serum of the individual presenting the neutral variant and analysed
by comparative tryptic peptide mapping (Fig. 1).
The analysis of the peptide map revealed the presence of an abnormal peptide, labeled 7 * ) eluting in
a position close to the normal peptide 7 (residues
49-70). Normaly peptide 7 also elutes at the end
of the gradient as an uncleaved product containing
peptide 8 (peptide 7-8); however, the mutant pep-

tide 7-8 (also labeled) is not separated from the
normal counterpart in the conditions of the gradient used. Aminoacid sequencing of peptide 7 *
showed the substitution of an alanine for threonine
at position 49 of the polypeptide chain. This substitution could be explained by a G for A change in
the codon of threonine [Thr (ACC)-Ala (GCC)].
This was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis
(data not shown). In order to study the other
members of the family, we synthesized allele specific oligonucleotides (ASO) for the mutation to
perform allele-specific hybridization since this mutation does not create or abolish any restriction site
for endonucleases.
From the 11 individuals analysed by A S 0 hybridization we found six carriers of the mutation;
two were FAP patients and the other four were
asymptomatic carriers as shown in Figure 2. All the
carriers were heterozygous for the mutation since
their DNA hybridized with the normal and the
mutant probe.
Concerning the other family with the basic
TTR variant, we isolated TTR from the serum of
the propositus and analysed it by comparative tryp-

tic peptide mapping. The peptide map obtained for
the basic TTR variant was similar to the normal
protein. Since this was not conclusive we proceeded with the DNA analysis of the propositus.
We sequenced PCR amplified exons of the TTR
gene and found a mutation in exon 3. This mutation is a substitution of a cytosine for a guanine
giving a substitution of glutamine (CAG) for glutamate (GAG) at position 89 of the TTR polypeptide chain (data not shown). In order to confirm
the substitution at the protein level we sequenced
peptide 10 (amino acids 81-103) and found a Gln
for Glu substitution at position 89. These results
are in agreement with the basic behaviour of the
mutant protein since there is a substitution of a
basic amino acid residue for an acidic one. The
base substitution corresponding to this mutation
abolishes a restriction site for endonuclease NlaIII;
however, the fragments originated could not be
separated by agarose gel electrophoresis since the
fragments differ only by 6 bases. Thus to investigate the presence of this TTR variant (TTR Gln89) in the members of the family we performed
hybridization with allele specific probes. We found

DISCUSSION
The TTR related hereditary amyloidoses are a
heterogeneous group of diseases with a variable degree of involvement of different organs. Some
TTR variants are associated with FAP with predominant neuropathy as the main clinical feature;
this is the case of TTR Met-30, TTR Ala-30, TTR
Leu-33, TTR Pro-36, TTR Leu-64, TTR Tyr-77,
and TTR Ser-84. Other FAP patients have a more
pronounced cardiac involvement as is the case of
TTR Ala-60 and TTR Asn-90 and yet others
present strict clinical characteristics such as amy-

loid deposition in the vitreous body and a carpal
tunnel syndrome (Saraiva et al., 1992).
The new TTR variants presented, TTR Ala-49
and TTR Gln-89, add to the wide range of variants
related with neuropathy and cardiomyopathy. The
TTR Ala-49 variant is also related with amyloid
deposition in the vitreous resembling the clinical
picture of TTR Ser-84 (Wallace et al., 1988),
TTR Pro-36 (Jones et al., 1991), and TTR Asn-90
(Skare e t al., 1989). Concerning TTR Gln-89
there is no vitreous involvement but there is carpal
tunnel syndrome as happens with TTR Ala-60
(Wallace et al., 1986).
When we compare the location of all the mutations and the clinical syndromes they originate

TWO TRANSTHYRETIN VARIANTS IN HEREDITARY AMYLOIDOSIS

we can say that most but not all the mutations lie
in or close to the loops between the P-sheets of the
polypeptide chain (Blake et al., 1978). It is possible that each mutation produces a modification in
the structure of the molecule that predisposes to
polymerization in fibrils and to preferable deposition in specific tissues. In addition, the same mutation can originate slightly different clinical features, namely the age of onset of the disease, as it
happens for the Met 30 mutation. On the other
hand, different mutations in the same position can
give similar clinical expressions like the Met-30
and Ala-30 mutations (Jones et al., 1992). This
can suggest that the process of fibril formation and
deposition can also involve tissue-specific factors.
Proteolysis is also a process that cannot be excluded to contribute to the deposition of amyloid
(Saraiva, 1991). Concerning this, it is interesting
that position 49, the position mutated in the neutral variant, is a position of TTR proteolysis (Westermark et al., 1991). Thus, in senile systemic
amyloidosis (SSA), a cardiac form of amyloidosis
where amyloid fibrils are mainly composed by TTR
fragments, proteolytic cleavage of nonmutated
TTR occurs around position 49 (Cornwell et al.,

1988).
As more TTR variants are characterized we will
get a better insight in the factors or processes involved in the pathogenesis of these variants.
