Summary. Single point mutations in the upstream region
of exon 6 of the ct-galactosidase A gene were found in
two Japanese cases of the cardiac form of Fabry disease;
3~
(9~
in a case that has already been
published and 279Gln--~Glu (835C--~G) in a new case. They
both expressed markedly low, but significant, amounts
of residual activity in COS-1 cells. In contrast, two unrelated cases with classic Fabry disease were found to
have different point mutations, which showed a complete loss of enzyme activity in a transient expression
assay; 3ZSGly--~Arg (982G----~A) in the downstream region of exon 6 in one case and two combined mutations,
66Glu----~Gin (196G---~C)/112Arg---~Cys (334C--*T), in exon 2
in the other. We conclude, on the basis of the results recorded in this study and those in previous reports, that
the pathogenesis of atypical Fabry disease is closely associated with point mutations in the upstream region of
exon 6 of the ~-galactosidase A gene.

Introduction
Fabry disease is an X-linked recessive disorder of intralysosomal glycosphingolipid storage caused by ct-galactosidase A (a-Gal A; E C 3.2.1.22) deficiency, leading to
clinical manifestations such as hypohidrosis, angiokeratoma, acroparesthesia, corneal opacity, and vascular diseases of the heart, kidneys and central nervous system
(Desnick and Bishop 1989).
Patients with classic Fabry disease of early onset have
no detectable a-Gal A activity, but several patients with
detectable residual enzyme activity have been reported
(Bach et al. 1982; Bishop et al, 1981; Clarke et al. 1971;
Kobayashi et al. 1985; R o m e o et al. 1975; Yamamoto et
al. 1989). In our previous study, two unrelated Japanese
atypical hemizygotes of this disease, characterized by
late-onset cardiomyopathy, were shown to have high residual u-Gal A activities (Nagao et al. 1991). In one of
Offprint requests to: S. Ishii

them, a G-to-A transition was found in exon 6 of the aGal A gene, resulting in a replacement of glutamine for
arginine (Sakuraba et al. 1990). In this paper, we report
new exonic point mutations in three additional families
with Fabry disease (two classic and one atypical cases)
and confirm a defect of transient expression in COS-1
cells. The genetic basis of the 0t-Gal A mutation is discussed in the atypical, late-onset cardiac form of Fabry
disease.

Patients
Classic form
Case I (cell//180). This 14 year-old boy developed episodic smarting
pains in toes and dorsum pedis at 10 years of age. Two years later,
he suffered from anhidrosis and continuous shooting pain in toes
and fingers. Physical examination revealed angiokeratoma on the
scrotum, buttocks and thighs. Corneal opacities were found by slitlamp examination. The ct-Gal A activity in lymphoblasts was deficient (0.9 nmol/h per mg protein; controls 87.0 _+23.1, mean + SD).
His brother showed the same clinical manifestations and also
proved to have deficient lymphocyte u-Gal A activity (0.4nmol/h
per mg protein).
Case 2 (cell//220). This 34 year-old man had a typical course of the
disease with episodic pains in the peripheral extremities, hypohidrosis, angiectasis and lymphedema of the legs since the age of 10
years. He subsequently experienced discomfort in the chest following exercise. Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic examinations revealed mitral insufficiency and left ventricular hypertrophy. There was no proteinuria, but his uncle, who had also had
Fabry disease, had died of renal failure in the fourth decade of life.
A deficiency of a-Gal A activity (0.5 nmol/h per mg protein) in
lymphoblasts was found.
Atypical form
Case 3 (cell #57). This patient developed dyspnea and bradycardia
for the first time at 60 years of age. Cardiologic examination revealed a complete left bundle branch block associated with hypertrophy of the left ventricular wall and interventricular septum. A
diagnosis of cardiomyopathy was made initially and he was treated

30
by pacemaker implantation. Numerous inclusion bodies were
found on electron microscopic examination of a myocardial biopsy, and screening of lysosomal enzymes revealed a specific decrease of a-Gal A activity (3.6nmol/h per mg protein). The patient developed cardiac failure and died at 64 years of age. He had
no other signs or symptoms characteristic of Fabry disease except
for proteinuria, which was found after cardiac failure had occurred.
Increased thickness of the interventricular septum and the left
ventricular wall was found in his 39 year-old nephew, by ultrasound cardiography and magnetic resonance imaging analysis. He
has remained apparently healthy and has not developed any other
signs or symptoms. He had a detectable residual ct-Gal A activity
(5.0 nmol/h per mg protein) in lymphoblasts.

Case 4 (cell#148). This case has been reported in a previous paper
(Sakuraba et al. 1990). Electrocardiographic abnormality and
hypertrophy of the ventricular septum and left ventricle were
found when this patient was evaluated for chest pain at the age of
52 years. The residual u-Gal A activity in lymphocytes was 3.3 nmol/h
per mg protein. A point mutation, 3~
was found by direct DNA sequence analysis (Sakuraba et al.
1990).

Materials and methods

Isolation and analysis of DNA and poly(A)+RNA
Details of lymphoblast culture, preparation of DNA and RNA,
and Southern and Northern blot analyses were as described in our
previous reports (Ishii et al. 1991; Sakuraba et al. 1990).

Amplification and sequencing
of reverse-transcribed a-Gal A mRNA
c~-Gal A cDNA was synthesized using the cDNA Synthesis System
Plus Kit (Amersham, Bucks., UK) according to the manufacturer's
instructions, amplified first with a set of primers 5'-TGAGAATTCAATTTATGCTGTCCGGTCA-3' (sense) and 5'-GCCGAATTCTTAAAGTAAGTCTTITAATGAC-3' (antisense), and then
re-amplified with a set of primers 5'-TGAGAATTCTCCGGTCACCGTGACAA-3' (sense) and 5'-GCCGAATTCTTAAAGTAAGTCTTTTAATGAC-3' (antisense) by the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) using the GeneAmp DNA Amplification Kit (Perkin Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, Conn., USA) under the conditions described previously (Ishii et al. 1991). The PCR products were subcloned into the EcoRI site of the M13mp19 vector. Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain-termination method with a universal primer and four other primers, 5'-GAGCTCATGGTCTCAGAA-3', 5'-GACTGAAGCTAGGGATI'T-3', 5'GACCCAGATATGTTAGTG-3' and 5'-GGCTTAGCCTGGGCTGTA-3' (Ishii et al. 1991).

Transient expression assay
ct-Gal A cDNA was prepared from normal lymphoblasts and was
inserted into the EcoRI site of the pBactE expression vector (kindly supplied by Dr. M. Ishiura, National Institute for Basic Biology,
Okazaki, Aichi, Japan); the product was designated pBaN. Expression vectors for mutant c~-Gal A were then constructed by directional cloning into pBaN of the fragments containing the mutation sites, as follows. For case 3 (cell #57), after digestion with
BglII and KpnI, a 0.5-kb fragment of mutant cDNA was purified by
electrophoresis and inserted into pBaN in place of the corresponding fragment (pBa57). For case 2 (cell #220) and case 4 (cell #148),
each 120-bp fragment was inserted into the BglI/KpnI sites (pBa220
and pBa148, respectively). For case 1 (cell #180), with two point
mutations in exon 2 (see below), a 360-bp fragment containing
both mutations was first prepared by digestion with NcoI and
BgIII, and then the two mutations were separated by SacI digestion. Three mutant cDNAs were constructed with an Ncol/Sacl
fragment (pBa180a), a SacI/BglII fragment (pBa180b), or an
Ncol/BglII fragment (combined mutations; pBa180ab).
COS-I cells (kindly supplied by Dr.Y.Nabeshima, National
Institute of Neuroscience, NCNP, Tokyo, Japan) were plated on
60-mm tissue culture dishes, grown in Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, transfected with 20~tg of
plasmid DNA/dish by the calcium phosphate/glycerol shock technique (Koide et al. 1990), and harvested in phosphate-buffered
saline after 5 days for RNA isolation (Chomczynski and Sacchi
1987) and subsequent Northern analysis, c~-Gal A activity was assayed using 4-methylumbelliferyl c~-D-galactopyranoside (Nacalai
Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) as substrate and N-acetylgalactosamine
(Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., USA) as an inhibitor of ct-galactosidase B
(a-N-acetylgalactosaminidase) (Mayes et al. 1981); the cells were
harvested 6 days after transfection, homogenized by sonication in
10 mM MES [2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid]-NaOH buffer
(pH 6.4), and used for enzyme assay.

each of both the classic and the atypical forms, in the
downstream region (codon 328) in case 2 (#220) and in
the upstream region (codon 279) in case 3 (#57). Two
combined point mutations in exon 2 were found in case
1 (#180).
Transfection with pBaN caused a 22- or 5-fold increase
of a-Gal A activity in COS-1 cells compared with mock
transfection (Fig. 1A); two different plasmid pBaN preparations were used in each transfection experiment. The
expressed enzyme activity corresponded to the amount
of transcripts (Fig. 1B); on the basis of m R N A amount,
therefore, the estimated specific enzyme activity was,
the same for both preparations. Significant amounts of
transcripts were observed without detectable a-Gal A
activity for plasmids pBa180a, pBa180b, pBa180ab, (case
1) and pBa220 (case 2). In contrast, a measurable expression of a-Gal A activity was observed for plasmid
pBa57 (case 3) and pBa148 (case 4); the calculated activity was 15% and 5%, respectively, of that for pBaN,
after the activity in mock-transfected COS-1 cells was
subtracted.

Discussion
Fabry disease is characterized by a generalized vasculopathy which in most cases appears in the second decade
of life. However, a new atypical form has recently been
recognized with cardiomyopathy, which shows a high residual activity of a-Gal A (Nagao et al. 1991; Sakuraba
et al. 1990; Scheidt et al. 1991). The patients presented
almost exclusively with cardiac signs and symptoms after
50 years of age, and no other clinical manifestations

were observed. The residual enzyme activity is variable
in different cell sources and has been reported in a range
of up to 25% of the control level. The pathogenesis of
this specific clinical form is not clear at present. Cardiac
muscles may be more susceptible to the defect of e-Gal A
activity.
A full-length cDNA has been cloned (Bishop et al.
1988) and its genomic structural organization analyzed
(Kornreich et al. 1989). The 12-kb genomic sequence
has seven exons and the 1397-bp ct-Gal A cDNA encodes
a precursor peptide of 429 amino acids including a 31-residue signal peptide. Southern hybridization analysis has
revealed that the frequency of large a-Gal A gene rearrangements in patients with Fabry disease is only 5-10%
(Bernstein et al. 1989; Sakuraba 1989) involving either
deletions (Fukuhara et al. 1990; Ishii et al. 1991; Kornreich et al. 1990; Sakuraba 1989) or else a splicing junction mutation (Sakuraba 1989). Although the majority
of these cases are expected to be caused by single base
substitutions, only three exonic point mutations have
been reported in the literature (Koide et al. 1990; Sakuraba et al. 1990; Scheidt et al. 1991).
In this study, we observed four additional amino-acid
substitutions in three cases; single base substitutions in
two cases and two combined base substitutions in the
other. The sites of exonic point mutations in the e-Gal A
cDNA (three in the literature and four in our present
study) are summarized in Fig. 2. So far, all point mutations have been found only in exons 1, 2 or 6. It is noteworthy that the mutations in the atypical cardiac type
cases are localized in the upstream region of exon 6:
279Gln---~Glu (case 3), 301 Arg--*Gln (case 4) (Sakuraba et
al. 1990) and 296Met--*Val (Scheidt et al. 1991). Aminoacid substitutions in these variant cases expressed high
residual enzyme activities in COS-1 cells. Furthermore,
a mutation in the downstream region of exon 6 was associated with the classic form of the disease (case 2). An
estimated secondary structure, calculated by the ChouFasman program (Chou and Fasman 1978), suggests that
the amino-acid substitutions in this variant do not affect
either a-helix structure or 13-sheet formation (S.Ishii et
al., unpublished data).
We conclude from these data that the point mutation
in the upstream region of the a-Gal A exon 6 is pathogeni-

32
cally associated with the cardiac v a r i a n t of F a b r y disease
expressing a less severe defect of e n z y m e function. Further analysis of the m u t a n t p r o t e i n m o l e c u l e will provide
m o r e i n f o r m a t i o n o n the relationship b e t w e e n the a m i n o acid s u b s t i t u t i o n a n d the f u n c t i o n a l defect of the enzyme.
