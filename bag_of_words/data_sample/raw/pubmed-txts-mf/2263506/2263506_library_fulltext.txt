G6PD Canton is one of the most common deficient variants in
Orientals, reaching a gene frequency of 1.7% in Southern China
(1). To identify the molecular lesion in G6PD Canton we have
sequenced the G6PD gene from an affected individual by PCR
amplification of exons followed by M 13 cloning and
dideoxynucleotide sequencing as described previously (2). The
entire coding sequence was determined. Only one base difference
from the wild type sequence G6PD B (3) was found; this was
a G- T change at position 1376 resulting in the substitution of
leucine for arginine at amino acid position 459. The change of
basic to uncharged amino acid is consistent with the
electrophoretic fast mobility of G6PD Canton. This arginine
residue is not conserved in G6PD molecules from yeast and
drosophila but it lies between two blocks of highly conserved
amino acids (4, 5).
