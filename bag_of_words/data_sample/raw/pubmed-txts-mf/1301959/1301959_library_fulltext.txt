Hereditary protein C (PC) deficiency is usually associated with a high risk of thrombosis. We report
the results of a study undertaken to screen for molecular defects in families with hereditary quantitative PC deficiency. Using a strategy combining polymerase chain reaction amplification of selected
gene fragments, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the amplification products, and direct sequencing of fragments with altered melting behavior, we studied the PC gene exons and exodintron
junctions of subjects with hereditary type I PC deficiency. Computer simulation of DNA melting was
used to design several sets of primers, each containing a GC-clamp, permitting the complete analysis of
each amplified exon sequence. Using this procedure, we identified two previously undescribed mutations located in exon VII: a C-to-T substitution generating a nonsense codon in place of Arg 157 in
the mature PC and a G-to-A substitution converting Arg 178 to GIn. The two mutations were detected
in, respectively, 3 and 2 apparently independent families. This strategy is therefore a valuable tool for
screening patients, and the results emphasize its advantages over plasma assays in individuals with a
family history of thrombosis. o 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

INTRODUCTION
Protein C (PC) is a vitamin K-dependent
plasma glycoprotein which is converted into a
serine protease after activation by thrombin complexed to thrombomodulin, a vascular receptor.
Protein S, another vitamin K-dependent protein,
regulates the reaction by assembling protein S-protein C complexes on phospholipid surfaces. These
complexes inactivate the two coagulation factors F
VIII and F V, thus reducing thrombin generation
(for review see Clouse and Comp, 1986; Esmon,
1989).
The clinical expression of hereditary PC deficiency is variable. A mild fall in the PC concentration is associated with thrombotic complications in about 50% of apparently heterozygous
individuals (Horellou et al., 1984; Bovill et al.,
1989). T h e frequency of this dominant clinical
0 1992 WILEY-LISS,INC.

trait is estimated at 1 in 15,000 in the general
population (Miletich, 1990).
Patients with undetectable levels of circulating
PC, thought to be either homozygotes or compound heterozygotes, develop massive thrombosis
during the neonatal period (Marciniak et al.,
1985). The parents and some family members of
these homozygous subjects are usually asymptomatic but present heterozygous plasma phenotype
(Marlar et al., 1989). The frequency of such asymptomatic heterozygous subjects is estimated at 1 in

200 or 300 in the general population (Miletich et
al., 1987).
These data suggest that only 1 in 50-80 patients with heterozygous plasma phenotype develops clinical symptoms and, in the absence of objective criteria to differentiate dominant and
recessive clinical traits, it is impossible to evaluate
the thrombotic risk associated with a mild deficiency in a given patient. Moreover, the overlapping concentration ranges in normal subjects and
deficient patients (Broekmans and Conard, 1988)
make it difficult to identify plasma heterozygosity
in patients with PC borderline values.
Identification of the molecular abnormality at
the gene level is the only way of clarifying the
heterogeneous presentations in hereditary PC deficiency. Direct analysis of genomic DNA could
help to establish the diagnosis and to identify patients at risk of thrombosis.
The PC gene, which maps to chromosome 2
(Rocchi et al., 1986; Kato et al., 1988; Patracchini
et al., 1989), was sequenced by Foster e t al. (1985)
and comprises 9 exons (Plutzky et al., 1986). Until
1991, few examples of genomic abnormalities had
been described in type I deficiency (characterized
by a simultaneous decrease in PC antigen levels
and activity). Apart from 3 cases of large insertions
or deletions (Crabtree et al., 1985), most patients
with heterozygous genotype had point mutations.
A Trp 402 to Cys substitution and a nonsense
codon at position 306 have been described by
Romeo et al. (1987). Of 30 novel mutations recently reported (Reitsma et al., 1991; Gandrille et
al., 1991; Grundy et al., 1991a; Yamamoto e t al.,
1991; Tsuda e t al., 1991; Sala et al., 1991), only 6
were due to microdeletions or insertions (Yamamoto et al., 1991; Tsuda et al., 1991; Sala et
al., 1991). Four families with homozygous genotype have also been described (Grundy et al.,
1991b; Conard et al., 1992).
In an attempt to identify the mutations responsible for PC deficiency in a large series of patients,
we have developed a strategy for rapid screening of
amplified gene fragments. It involves amplification
of genomic DNA targets by the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), followed by denaturing gradient
gel electrophoresis (DGGE). In carefully chosen
conditions, fragments bearing mutations display a
shift in mobility on DGGE. We applied this strategy to the analysis of exon VII in 25 families with
type I PC deficiency and we detected 2 novel mutations in 5 apparently independent families. In 3
cases, a C-to-T substitution generated a nonsense
codon at position 157 of the protein, while in the

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Exon VII from subjects belonging to 25 families
presenting with hereditary type I PC deficiency
were studied. Five apparently independent families
presented with a mutation in this exon. The main
clinical features of these five family members are
described in Table 1, and 4 of the 5 pedigrees are
presented in Figure 1. Unfortunately, only the
propositus of family E could be explored (an acquired PC deficiency was excluded by normal hemostasis test results).
One of the 3 affected members in each family A
or B presented unusual thrombosis. In the propositus of family A, several episodes of lower-limb arterial thrombosis with no apparent cause were observed. Subject 11.2 of family B suffered a
pulmonary embolism after starting oral contraception. In family C, patient 11.3 suffered from pulmonary embolism at the age of 21 years, whereas
the other 2 patients were asymptomatic. The propositus of family D (1.2) was investigated following
a fetal death due to placental infarction. Patient E
had presented recurrent deep-vein thrombosis
since the age of 18 years.
Seven of the 12 heterozygous patients were
asymptomatic; the first thrombotic complication

previous findings (Marlar, 1985; Broekmans,

1988).
The diagnosis of PC deficiency was based o n low
PC activities, measured using an amidolytic assay
(Stachrom Prot C, Stago, Asniere, France, or Berichrom Behring, Rueil, France), a coagulation assay (Staclot, Stago), and low antigen levels (Asserachrom Prot C, Stago). The normal range was
70-130% in the 3 commercial techniques.
Venous blood samples were collected in 0.11 M
trisodium citrate (1:lO) for PC assays and the
plasma was kept frozen until use. Blood was collected in ethylene diamine tetracetic acid for the
DNA studies and kept at VC. Leukocytes were
isolated within 48 hr and stored frozen until DNA
extraction.

Methods

DNA was extracted from the patients’ leukocytes and purified as previously described (MolhoSabatier et al., 1989).
Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a gene assembler (381A DNA synthesizer, Applied Biosysterns). The 20-mers (i.e., PC7) were purified by
ethanol precipitation, while the GC-clamps (i. e.,
the 55-mers GCPC7 containing a 35 nucleotide
GC-clamp) were purified on an OPC column prior
to ethanol precipitation.
General strategy

Enzymatic amplification of each PC gene exon
and its splice junctions was performed essentially as
described by Saiki e t al. (1988), using a set of
oligonucleotides comprising a 20-mers and a
primer to which a G
C-rich sequence (GCclamp) comprising various numbers of nucleotides
was added (Myers et al. , 1985a,b; Sheffield e t al. ,
1989). This GC-rich region allows amplified fragments to be screened for sequence variations by

+

DGGE. All primer sequences are presented in Table 2 and their locations are presented in Figure 2.
The locations of the PCR primers were chosen
using the computer programs MELT 87 and
SQHTX, written and kindly provided by Drs. Lerman and Silverstein (1987). These softwares simulate the melting behavior of DNA fragments according to their nucleotide sequence and base
composition. The information thus acquired was
used to select positions for PCR primers allowing
the generation of fragments suitable for DGGE
analysis and to determine the range of denaturant
concentrations and electrophoresis times giving
maximum gel resolution. In every instance, one of
the amplification primers carried at its 5‘ end an
additional G
C-rich nucleotide fragment in order to create a high temperature melting domain
(Sheffield et al., 1989) and to position the sequence of interest within the first melting domain.
Because of their length, exons 111 and IX were
studied using 2 and 3 sets of primers, respectively.
DGGE could not be used for exons IV and V be-

PC gene exon VII amplification was performed using PC7 and GCPC7 as extension primers. As shown in Figure 3, PC7 was located in IVS
F and GC-PC 7 in IVS G. Amplification was
performed as follows: each PCR mixture contained
30 pmol of each primer, 200 p M of each dNTP, 1
pg of genomic DNA, 1 x PCR buffer [I0 mM
Tris-HC1, pH 8.3, 50 mM KC1, 1 mM MgCl,,
0.01% (w/v) gelatin], and 2.5 U of Tag polymerase
in a final volume of 100 ELI. The reactions were run
in a Perkin-Elmer Cetus DNA thermal cycler. The
thermal profile included 5 min denaturation at
94"C, followed by 30 cycles consisting of denaturation for 1 min at 94"C, annealing for 1 min at
60"C, and extension for 1 min at 72°C. Samples
were held at 72°C for 10 min, and the PCR cycles
were followed by 10 min denaturation at 94°C and
45 min at 56°C to favor heteroduplex formation.
The 284-bp PCR product obtained was analyzed
on a 6% polyacrylamide gel.
0 DGGE was performed as described by Attree
et al. (1989). Amplified DNA fragments were subjected to electrophoresis for 5 hr at 160 V in a
6.5% polyacrylamide gel containing a 30-80% denaturant gradient (100% denaturant = 7 M urea
and 40% formamide in TAE buffer) and stained
with e thidium bromide.
0 T h e asymmetric PCR method developed by
Gyllensten and Erlich (1988) was performed using
5 pmol of PC7 and 50 pmol of GCPC7, as described above, except that the thermal profile involved 60 cycles. This reaction leads to the preferential amplification and enrichment of the
noncoding strand of exon VII. The single-stranded
templates were sequenced using the sequenase kit
with PC7 as the sequencing primer.

RESULTS
Using DGGE, we analyzed all the coding regions and splice junctions of the PC gene. For
exons 1-111 and VI-IX, computer prediction of
DNA melting behavior enabled us to design a set
of 2 primers. The first contained a GC-rich region
(GC-clamp) at its 5' end, permitting the complete
analysis of each amplified PC gene exon and its
flanking splice-site sequences by DGGE. The

other exons (IV and V) were analyzed by direct
sequencing after asymmetric PCR amplification.
In the 5 families with mild PC deficiency depicted in Figure 1, the only abnormality was located in exon VII.
Figure 3 depicts the position of the primers
(PC7 and GCPC7) used to amplify a 284-bp fragment. The melting curve of the resulting amplified
fragment confirmed that the sequence of interest
(exon VII and its associated splice region) was located within the first melting domain of the DNA
fragment.
Two different DGGE patterns were observed,
suggesting the existence of 2 different exon VII
mutations: 1 in families A and B and 1 in families

GE.
The normal and mutant homoduplex fragments
were not separated in families A and B, but the
presence of heteroduplexes (upper 2 bands) was
typical of a nucleotide substitution in 1 of the alleles (Fig. 4a). Heteroduplexes, generated during
the last step of PCR, are due to mismatches of
normal alleles with mutant alleles and melt at a
lower denaturant concentration. Patients 11.6 and
11.9 (family A) and 1.2 (family B) were carriers,
since their abnormal DGGE pattern was identical
to that of the propositus.

In families C and D (Fig. 4b) and in patient E,
the DGGE patterns contained 4 bands, with the
upper 2 bands constituting a very close doublet.
These patterns are also typical of heterozygosity:
band 4 migrated like DNA fragments from normal
subjects and represents normal homoduplexes.
Band 3 corresponded to homoduplexes of the mutant allele. Bands 1 and 2 resulted from the generation of heteroduplexes.
To check that the observed abnormalities were
not neutral polymorphisms, we tested 60 individuals with normal PC levels; the DGGE pattern was
normal in all cases.
The genomic abnormalities were further characterized by direct sequencing of the singlestranded fragment obtained by asymmetric amplification. In families A and B (Fig. 5a), a G-to-A
transition converted Arg 178 to Gln. In the other
three families, a C-to-T substitution generated a
nonsense codon in place of the Arg at position 157
(Fig. 5b).
Hybridization of amplified exon VII fragments
with AS 0 corresponding to either the normal or
abnormal sequences (Fig. 6) confirmed that all the
patients with PC deficiency were heterozygous for
the defect, as both normal and mutant AS0 hybridized with amplified DNA.

DISCUSSION
Some of the difficulties encountered in the diagnosis of hereditary PC deficiencies can be overcome by using DNA analysis, and DGGE proved
to be a valuable tool in this setting. This electrophoretic method enables DNA fragments to be
separated according to changes in the melting
properties produced by simple nucleotide substitutions (Fischer and Lerman, 1983; Myers et al.,
198%). The technique permitted rapid screening
of our patients, restricting the need for DNA sequencing to the samples showing abnormal electrophoretic mobility.
We detected 2 novel mutations in exon VII
which would alter expression of the protein in
some of our patients. A missense mutation (in 2
families) or a nonsense codon (in the other 3 fam-

ilies) were located in this critical domain which
contains 2 cleavage sites essential for correct maturation of the protein and its activation by thrombin.
In the former case, the mutation led to the replacement of the Arg at position 178 by a Gln. PC
is a vitamin K-dependent zymogen presenting
structural similarities with clotting factors 11, VII,
IX, and X. Arg 178 is located within a domain
containing several highly conserved amino acids
and is adjacent to Gly 179, a residue found at this
position in most vitamin K-dependent proteins
(when sequences are aligned). In factor IX, the
substitution of Gln 191, which is located immediately after the corresponding Gly, is associated
with severe antigen-negative hemophilia B (Giannelli e t al., 1990). The Arg 178 to Gln muta-

the 3 family C members bearing the mutation, PC
levels varied over a wide range.
The 2 mutations described here involve CpG

Arg 152 + Cys, Pro 168 + Leu, and Arg 178 +
Trp (Gandrille et al., 1991; Reitsma et al., 1991;
Conard et al., 1992), also involved CpG dimers.
Therefore, 5 of the 6 CpG dimers present in exon
VII have so far been shown to be the sites of mutations, as summarized in Figure 7. These hot-spots
for mutation may explain the recurrence of the
mutations of our families; however, as our patients
were all European Caucasian, 1 family being Portuguese, and the others being French families, we
cannot exclude an identity by descent, as described
in 3 families by Reitsma et al. (1991).
