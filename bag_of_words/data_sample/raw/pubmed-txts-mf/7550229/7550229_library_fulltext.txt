We characterized two novel mutations of the galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) gene in
two Japanese patients with GALT deficiency and identified N 3 14D and R333W mutations, previously
found in Caucasians. One novel missense mutation was an G-to-A transition in exon 8, resulting in the
substitution of arginine by histidine at the codon 23 1 (R23 1H). GALT activity of the R23 1H mutant
construct was reduced to 15% of normal controls in a COS cell expression system. The other was a
splicing mutation, an A-to-G transition at the 38th nucleotide in exon 3 (318A+G), resulting in a
38-bp deletion in the GALT cDNA by activating a cryptic splice acceptor site. I n seven Japanese
families (14 alleles for classic form and one allele for Duarte variant) with GALT deficiency, the
R 2 3 1 H and 318A-G mutations were found only on both alleles of the proband. T h e N314D and
R333W mutations were found on one allele each. The Q l 8 8 R was prevalent in the United States but
not in Japanese patients. The N314D mutation was associated with the Duarte variant in Japanese
persons, as well as in the United States. We speculate that classic galactosemia mutations appear to
differ between Japanese and Caucasian patients. Our limited data set on galactosemia mutations in
Japanese suggests that the N 3 14D GALT mutation encoding the Duarte variant arose before Asian
and Caucasian people diverged and that classic galactosemia mutations arose and/or accumulated after

INTRODUCTION
Classic deficiency galactosemia is an autosomal
recessive genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of
galactose- 1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT)
(MIM 230400) (Segal, 1989) with an incidence
of 1:60,000 in the United States (Levy and
Hammersen, 1978) and 1:1,000,000 in Japan
(Aoki and Wada, 1988). The disease causes neonatal jaundice, cataracts, hepatomegaly, failure to
thrive, and even neonatal death, unless the patient is rigorously maintained o n a lactose-free
diet. Many developed countries have instituted
newborn screening programs for galactosemia.
The study of galactosemia at the molecular level
began with cloning and characterization of the human GALT cDNA (Reichardt and Berg, 1988;
Flach et al., 1990b). The entire gene for human

GALT has been characterized by Leslie et al.
(1992). More than 10 missense and splicing mutations have been identified in Caucasians and African-Americans (Flach e t al., 1990a; Reichardt
and Woo, 1991; Reichardt et al., 1991, 1992a,b).
T h e relationship between genotype and clinical
phenotype has been examined in Caucasians. The
most prevalent Ql88R mutation, and several other
mutations have been associated with classic deficiency galactosemia (Reichardt, 1992). The
N3 14D mutation has been associated with the
mild clinical phenotype of the Duarte and Los An-

geles variants (Lin et al., 1994). However, GALT
mutations have not been identified in Asians and
are suspected to be different from those found in
Caucasians, in part because molecular analysis of
other inherited metabolic disorders has revealed
different mutations (Okano et al., 1992). In addition, the frequency of the classic deficiency galactosemia in Japan is 1/20th less than that in
the United States. We report here a novel missense mutation and a novel splicing mutation in
two Japanese patients with classic deficiency
galactosemia and the distribution of N3 14D,
QlSSR, and R333W mutations in seven Japanese
families.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients

We analyzed 14 classic deficiency galactosemia
(G) alleles and one Duarte variant (D) allele from
7 families with GALT deficiency. Patients 1 and 2
were identified with typical symptoms of galactosemia and were diagnosed with classic deficiency
galactosemia having less than 1% of normal erythrocyte GALT activity. Patient 1 was nonconsanguineous; however, the parents both came from
Okinawa island, and patient 2 was consanguineous. In the third family, the younger brother (patient 3B) was identified with classic deficiency galactosemia by newborn screening, showing less
than 1% GALT activity and had the G/G phenotype. The elder sister (patient 3A) was healthy,
with 20% of normal GALT activity having the
D/G phenotype. GALT proteins of classic deficiency galactosemia and Duarte variant were characterized with starch gel electrophoresis. Futthermore, their father had the D/G phenotype, and
their mother had the N/G phenotype by GALT
activity in erythrocyte and starch gel electrophoresis. They were nonconsanguineous. Patient 4, with
classic deficiency galactosemia, was identified
through the Japanese Regional Newborn Screening Program, showing less than 1% of normal
erythrocyte GALT activity. His parents and elder
brother showed 50% of normal erythrocyte GALT
activity. He was nonconsanguineous and has been
rigorously maintained o n lactose-free diet; he has
developed without mental retardation or cataracts
(Table 1). Three other Japanese patients (three
families) with classic deficiency galactosemia were
identified through the Japanese Regional Newborn Screening Program, showing abnormally
low GALT activity, and were nonconsanguineous.

PCR Amplification and Sequence Analysis of
GALT cDNA
Total RNA was isolated from lymphoblasts
transformed with Epstein-Barr virus using the acid
guanidium isothiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987).
For cDNA synthesis, 20 pg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT)12-18 (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Inc.) and 30 units of avian
myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Life Science) as described elsewhere (Kobayashi et al.,
1990). The GALT coding region was amplified
with primers hG5-19 (5’-TTTTTCCAGCGGA-

TCCCCC-3’), hG3-23 (5’-CTTAATTCAGCAAGACTGTTGAA), 1 mM each dNTP, 4 units
of the T t h DNA polymerase (Toyobo) and 10 x
reaction buffer (TOYOBO) by 35 cycles at 94°C
for 80 sec, 50°C for 120 sec, and 72°C for 180 sec
in a thermal sequencer (Iwaki). Amplified products were purified by elution from 1.2% low melting temperature agarose gel, treated with blunting
kits (Takara), and digested with XhoI. Both 5’ and
3’ fragments were subcloned into M13mp19 with
SmaI and SalI sites. A t least five clones for each
fragment were sequenced with universal and specific oligonucleotide primers for the GALT sequence using a Sequenase DNA sequencing kit

(USB).
Genomic DNA Sequencing
Genomic DNA was isolated from lymphoblasts
of Japanese patients with GALT deficiency. Exons
3-5 and their flanking intronic regions of GALT
genomic DNA were amplified with primers (5’TGGGTCATATCCCACCAAGC-3’) and (5 ’TGGAAACAGAAATGTTACTCC-3‘) by PCR
as described above. Amplified DNA was purified
by elution from 2% low melting temperature agarose gel and recovered using the Gene-Clean kit

38

ASHINO ET AL.

(BiolOl). Purified DNA was digested with Hind111
and subcloned into pUC 18 and sequenced with a
specific primer for intron 3.
Expression Analysis

Part (439 bp) of the mutant GALT cDNA, including the R231H mutation, was removed from
the M13mp19 mutant GALT cDNA by digesting
with BglII and PuuII. The isolated mutant GALT
cDNA was inserted at the BglII and PvuII sites of
PJR16 GALT, a mammalian expression vector
containing normal GALT cDNA (Reichardt and
Berg, 1988). The mutant and normal PJR16 were
introduced into monkey kidney COS cells in 20
mM Hepes, at pH 7.05, 137 mM NaC1, 5 mM
KCI, 0.7 mM Na2HP04, and 6 mM dextrose by
electroporation with a Gene Pulser (BioRad) at
200 V with 960-pF capacitance. After 72 hr of
culture, the cells were harvested, and the GALT
mRNA and GALT activity were determined in
cellular extracts. GALT mRNA levels in cellular
extracts were determined by dot-blot hybridization
for serially diluted RNA samples, using a GALT
cDNA probe labeled with [a-32P]-dCTP(DuPontNEN) by the Megaprime DNA labeling systems
(Amersham). GALT activity was determined by
GALT assay kits (Sigma) with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotidase.
Allele-Specific Oligonucleotide Hybridization
and Restriction Enzyme Assay

Amplified DNA samples were denatured and
applied o n Gene Screen nylon membranes (NEN)
with a dot-blot manifold (Schleicher & Schuell),
and were hybridized with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes labeled with 32P for normal alleles (5’-CCTAGGAACGTCTGGTCCT-3’
for
R23 1H mutation, 5 ’-TGTTTGACAACGACTTCCC-3’ for 318A-G mutation) and mutant alleles (5’-CCTAGGAACATCTGGTCCT-3’
for
R23 1H mutation, 5’eTGTTTGACAGCGACTTCCC-3’ for 318A-G mutation), as described
elsewhere (DiLella et al., 1988). The QlSSR,
N314D, and R333W mutations were detected by
digesting with restriction enzyme after PCR. For
the Ql88R mutation, PCR-amplified product of
exon 6 were digested with HpaII. For N3 14D, PCR
amplification of exon 10 was digested with AvaII
(Lin et al., 1994); for R333W, exon 10 was digested with HpaII.

RESULTS
Identification of a Missense Mutation in Patient 1

In patient 1, we detected a missense mutation
(G-to-A transition) at nucleotide position 2066 of

the GALT genomic gene (nucleotide position 720
of the GALT cDNA) in 3’ fragments of GALT
cDNA, resulting in the substitution of arginine by
histidine at codon 231 (R231H) (Fig. 1). This mutation was present in all five independent clones of
3’ fragments. We detected a normal sequence of 5’
fragments of GALT cDNA in all five independent
clones. Thus, we found the mutation in patient 1
to be homozygous. To determine whether the
R23 1H mutation caused galactosemia, expression
analysis was performed in COS cells. In dot-blot
hybridization of serially diluted RNA from transfected cells, the mRNA levels of the normal
GALT cDNA constructs expressed 1.5 times that
of the mutant GALT cDNA constructs. GALT
activity of the R231H mutant constructs in the
COS cell expression system was 10% of the normal
GALT constructs. Therefore, the GALT activity
of the mutant protein was 15% of the normal control after revising the efficiency of transfection into
COS cells.
Identification of a Splicing Mutation in Patient 2

The PCR amplification product of GALT
cDNA in patient 2 showed a slightly short band
compared with normal control, and no normal
band was found. We detected a 38-bp deletion
from nucleotide position 281-318 of the GALT
cDNA identified by sequencing 5’ fragments of
GALT cDNA of all eight independent clones,
which we analyzed (Fig. 2). This deletion spanned
nucleotides 1-38 in exon 3 (nucleotide position
793-830 of GALT genomic gene). The sequence
of 3’ fragments of GALT cDNA in all six independent clones was normal. Thus, we found the
mutation in patient 2 to be homozygous. To identify the molecular defect in the genomic DNA, we
sequenced exon 3 and the flanking intronic regions of GALT genomic DNA. We found an
A-to-G transition (318A-G) at the 38th base in
exon 3, which produced a new cryptic splice accepter site (AA-AG) and caused the first 38-bp
deletion in exon 3 in GALT cDNA (Fig. 3). The
318A+G mutation in GALT genomic DNA
caused 38-bp short GALT cDNA and did not
cause normal-length GALT cDNA.
Frequency of Galactosemic Mutations
in Japanese

Dot-blot hybridization for R231H and
318A-tG mutations was performed in seven Japanese families with GALT deficiency. T h e R231H
mutation was found on both alleles of patient 1,

and the 318A-G mutation was found on both
alleles of patient 2. Neither mutation was found in
any other Japanese patients. Digestion with restriction enzymes for QlSSR, N314D, and R333W mutations was also performed. We never observed the
Q188R mutation, but the R333W mutation was
found o n one allele. N314D was identified on one
allele of the elder sister, who had 20% GALT activity, but was not found in the younger sister, who
had less than 1% GALT activity.

DISCUSSION
We found the two novel mutations of the

GALT gene in two Japanese patients, and identified N314D and R333W mutations, previously
found in Caucasians (Table 1). The R231H mutation was a CGT (arginine) to CAT (histidine)
transition in exon 8, which occurred at the CpG
dinucleotides, at a frequency of 42-fold that of random mutation (Cooper and Youssoufian, 1988).
Furthermore, this R23 1H mutation was found in a

conserved domain in the homologous enzyme from
Escherichia coli, yeast, and humans (Tajima et al.,
1985; Lemaire and Mueller-Hill, 1986). In expression analysis of the R231H mutation, GALT activity of the mutant protein was 15% of the normal
GALT protein. Interestingly, GALT activity of
erythrocytes in patient 1 with R231HiR231H genotype was less than 1% of normal controls. The
reasons for the discrepancy between the GALT
activity in COS cells and that in erythrocytes are
unclear. However, it is probable that there are
some differences in the regulation of the GALT
gene and in the post-transcriptional modification
of the two systems. The Ql88R mutation, which is
most prevalent in Caucasian patients with classic
deficiency galactosemia, showed about 10% of the
control GALT activity in the COS cell expression
system. Similarly, GALT activity of erythrocytes
from patients with the homozygous Ql88R mutation was less than 1%of controls (Reichardt et al.,
1991). It also has been reported that phenylala-

nine hydroxylase activity in the COS cell expression system results in higher activity than observed
in the liver of patients with phenylketonuria
(Okano e t al., 1991). Thus, the COS cell expression system may result in overestimation of the
level of activity of certain mutant enzymes. We
conclude that the R23 1H mutation encodes the
reduced GALT enzymatic activity and results in
classic deficiency galactosemia.
We identified the 38-bp deletion in exon 3 by
GALT cDNA analysis and the A-to-G transition
at the 38th nucleotide in exon 3 by genomic DNA
analysis. This mutation produced a cryptic splice
acceptor site ( A G ) and caused the skipping of the
first 38 bp in exon 3. Shapiro and Senapathy
(1987) reported a splicing score system at 3’ splice
acceptor sites with nucleotides of CAGG and polypyrimidine tract. The score at the original splice
acceptor site in intron 2 was 78.4, whereas the
score at the novel cryptic splice acceptor site in
exon 3 was 87.6 (Fig. 4). The 318A+G splicing

mutation is predicted to result in a frameshift that
would cause a prematurely terminated protein 8
amino acids downstream. This abnormal polypeptide would be only 92 amino acids long, while the
normal GALT protein is 329 amino acids. Patient
2, with 318A+G/318A+G genotype, showed
classic deficiency galactosemia and less than 1% of
erythrocyte GALT activity. This 318A-G mutation reduced the GALT enzymatic activity and
caused classic deficiency galactosemia.
The Q188R, N314D) and R333W mutations
identified in Caucasians were analyzed in Japanese
patients with GALT deficiency. It has been generally reported that mutations that cause inherited
metabolic disorders are different among races,
whereas when mutations are in CpG dinucleotides, the mutation is recurrent among different
races (Okano e t al., 1992; Tanaka e t al.) 1993). In
fact, the Q188R mutation not in CpG dinucleotide, the most prevalent mutation in the United
States, having a frequency of 25-66% (Reichardt

e t al., 1991; Leslie et al., 1992) was not found in
Japanese. The R333W mutation in CpG dinucleotide being a rare mutation (1 out of 20 alleles) in
the United States (Reichardt et al., 1991) was
found on one allele in Japanese patients. We have

detected three mutations (R231H, 318A+G,
R333W) in five alleles, including two alleles of a
consanguineous patient from seven Japanese patients with classic deficiency galactosemia. We
speculate, from our limited data, that classic ga-

42

lactosemia mutations appear to differ between Japanese and Caucasian patients.
Since the GALT activity of the N314D mutation in the COS cell expression system was 129%
of the control, and was found in clinically unaffected patients, the N314D mutation has been
originally recognized as a polymorphism (Reichardt and Woo, 1991). Lin et al. (1994) have
found the N314D mutation o n 34 of 35 different
Duarte alleles examined in Caucasian, Hispanic
American, and African-American patients, suggesting that the N3 14D mutation encodes the Duarte variant of GALT. We also detected the
N314D mutation o n one allele from a sister with
the D/G phenotype in a Japanese patient. We suggest that the N314D mutation is associated with
the Duarte variant in all races. As the N314D
mutation is not a CpG dinucleotide, this mutation
does not tend to occur recurrently among races.
Although the classic deficiency galactosemia is
rare both in Japan and in the United States, the
prevalence of the Duarte variant in Japan (2.0%)
(Ichiba, 1989) is as high as in the United States
(5.5%) (Mathai and Beutler, 1966). Linkage disequilibrium between the N3 14D mutaion in Caucasians and Asians, including our Japanese D/G
individual and a GALT RFLP, has recently been
described (Lin and Reichardt, 1995). These findings suggest that the N314D mutation that encodes the Duarte variant occurred before racial divergence between Caucasians and Asians; that is,
the N314D mutation is an ancient mutation. Our
limited data set on galactosemia mutations in Japanese suggests that the N314D GALT mutation
encoding the Duarte variant arose before the divergence between Asian and Caucasian populations and that classic galactosemia mutations arose
and/or accumulated after this divergence. We intend to address these two propositions in future
studies, with additional Asian samples. Finally,
the homozygosity of galactosemia mutations in Japanese patients may suggest inbreeding and/or population bottlenecks in the Japanese population.
