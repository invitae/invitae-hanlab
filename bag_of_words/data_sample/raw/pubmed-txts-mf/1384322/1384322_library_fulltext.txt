Summary
Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder resulting in
severe combined immunodeficiency. The purpose of this study was to determine the molecular defects
responsible for PNP deficiency in one such patient. The patient's PNP cDNA was amplified by PCR and
sequenced. Point mutations leading to amino acid substitutions were found in both alleles. One point
mutation led to a Ser-to-Gly substitution at amino acid 51 and was common to both alleles. In addition, an
Asp-to-Gly substitution at amino acid 128 and an Arg-to-Pro substitution at amino acid 234 were found
in the maternal and paternal alleles, respectively. In order to prove that these mutations were responsible for
the disease state, each of the three mutations was constructed separately by site-directed mutagenesis of the
normal PNP cDNA, and each was transiently expressed in COS cells. Lysates from cells transfected with the
allele carrying the substitution at amino acid 51 retained both function and immunoreactivity. Lysates from
cells transfected with PNP alleles carrying a substitution at either amino acid 128 or amino acid 234 contained
immunoreactive material but had no detectable human PNP activity. In summary, molecular analysis of
this patient identified point mutations within the PNP gene which are responsible for the enzyme deficiency.

Introduction

Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP; E.C.2.4.2.1)
deficiency is a rare form of severe combined immunodeficiency. It was first described, in 1975 by Giblett et
al. (1975), in a 5-year-old girl with T-cell immunodeficiency. Subsequently, 32 other patients, including
the patient studied in the present report, have been
identified (Markert et al. 1987a; Markert 1991). Children with PNP deficiency typically have profoundly
deficient T-cell function and either normal, decreased,
or autoreactive B-cell function. In addition to recurrent infections and failure to thrive, some of these
children also suffer from autoimmune disease, neurologic impairment, and malignancies (Markert 1991).

PNP-deficient patients die in the first or second decade
of life, usually from infections (Ammann et al. 1978;
Carapella-de Luca et al. 1978; Virelizier et al. 1978;
Corrales et al. 1983; McGinniss et al. 1985), malignancies (Stoop et al. 1977; Watson et al. 1981),
or graft-versus-host disease following nonirradiatedblood transfusions (Stoop et al. 1977; Strobel et al.
1989).
Human PNP is a symmetric trimer composed of
three identical 32,153-dalton subunits, each with a
substrate-binding site (Agarwal and Parks 1969; Zannis et al. 1978; Williams et al. 1987). PNP reversibly
catalyzes the phosphorolysis of the purine nucleosides,
(deoxy)inosine and (deoxy)guanosine, to their respective purine bases and the corresponding ribose-1phosphate. In T cells, the absence of PNP activity is
thought to lead to an accumulation of deoxyguanosine
triphosphate, an accumulation which inhibits the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (Carson et al. 1977;
Mitchell et al. 1978; Ullmann et al. 1979; Kredich
and Hershfield 1989). This inhibition blocks DNA

synthesis, thereby preventing the cellular proliferation
required for an immune response.
PNP deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The PNP gene is located on chromosome
14 (Ricciuti and Ruddle 1973) and comprises six exons spaced over approximately 9 kb of DNA (Williams et al. 1984, 1987). Several different mutant PNP
proteins have been described. These have been characterized with regard to altered migration in isoelectric
focusing, resistance to sulfhydryl oxidation, and heat
instability (Siegenbeek van Heukelom et al. 1976; Gudas et al. 1978; Wortmann et al. 1979; McRoberts
and Martin 1980). To date, the genetic mutation responsible for enzyme inactivity has been identified in
only one homozygous patient (Williams et al. 1987).
In that patient, a single-base-pair change which resulted in an amino acid substitution was detected. We
describe the sequence of two mutant PNP alleles from
a second PNP-deficient patient, TP. In these alleles we
identify three unique point mutations (different from
the one previously described), two of which result in
the loss of enzymatic activity. Coupled with the
knowledge of the crystallographic structure (Ealick et
al. 1990), these observations let us speculate about
the role of certain amino acids in PNP structure and
function.
Material and Methods
Cell Lines

B-lymphoblastoid cell lines were established from
Ficoll-Hypaque-purified peripheral mononuclear cells
by Epstein-Barr virus transformation (Katsuki and Hinuma 1975) in the presence of 1 gg cyclosporin A/ml
(Anderson and Gusella 1984). The identity of each cell
line studied was confirmed by HLA typing, courtesy of
Dr. Francis Ward (Duke University), and by a radiochemical assay of PNP activity.
PNP Assay

Extracts from the B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, prepared by freezing and thawing, were chromatographed on a G25 Sephadex spun column according
to a method described by Greenberg et al. (1989).
These cell extracts were assayed for PNP activity essentially according to a method described by Fox et al.
(1977), except that 14C-hypoxanthine (product) was
separated from substrate ('4C-inosine) on cellulose
thin-layer plates (PolygramCel 400 UV2so; MackereyNagel) which were developed in water.

Protein Levels

Protein levels of the B-lymphoblastoid and COS cell
lysates were determined using the BioRad protein
assay, Bradford (1976) method.
RNA and DNA Purification

RNA was isolated from the patient's cell line by the
technique of Chirgwin et al. (1979; Markert et al.
1987b), by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction followed by purification using cesium chloride gradient
centrifugation. Poly(A+ ) RNA was prepared using
oligo[dT] column chromatography (Avis and Leder
1972). DNA was purified by the method of Gustafson
et al. (1987).
Northern RNA Analyses
Approximately 3.5

pg of Poly(A + ) RNA was applied to each lane of a 2.2 M formaldehyde 1% agarose gel (Thomas 1983). The RNA was transferred to
a Pall Biodyne A membrane (ICN Radiochemicals,
Irvine, CA) and was processed according to a method
described by Markert et al. (1987b).
Probes

The plasmid, pPNP1, a nearly full-length (1,418
bp) PNP cDNA in the plasmid pBR322, was provided
by Dr. David Martin (Genentech, Inc.) (Williams et
al. 1984). The PNP cDNA probe used for Southern
analyses was a 587-bp PstI restriction fragment derived from pPNP1. This fragment encompassed the 3'
139 bp of exon 2, all of exons 3 and 4, and the first
168 bp of exon 5 of the PNP cDNA. The adenosine
deaminase control probe, 117-7, obtained from Drs.
John Hutton and Dan Wiginton (Cincinnati), extends
between the BamHI sites at positions 14373 and
14784 of the ADA gene (Wiginton et al. 1986). This
position is 5' of exon 2 of the ADA gene. The actin
control probe, pHFBA. 1, contains the 3' untranslated
region of the human fibroblast cytoplasmic ,B-actin
cDNA (Gunning et al. 1983) and was provided by Dr.
Larry Kedes (University of Southern California). The
probes were labeled with 32p to a specific activity of
greater than 108 cpm/pg (Feinberg and Vogelstein
1983, 1984).
cDNA Synthesis, Cloning, and Sequencing
cDNA was prepared by the method of Gubler and
Hoffman (1983). The PNP cDNA was amplified from
the total cDNA by PCR (Perkin Elmer Cetus) (Saiki et
al. 1985) by a sense primer from - 79 to - 60 and an

Point Mutations in PNP Deficiency

antisense primer from + 1182 to + 1201 of the PNP
cDNA (the numbering is with respect to the initiation
of translation in the normal PNP cDNA) (Williams et
al. 1984). This amplified cDNA was cloned (from the
BamHI site at - 58 to the blunted 3' end) into the
plasmid, pGEM3Zf- (Promega). PNP cDNA for
both alleles was sequenced by the double-stranded
(Wang et al. 1988) dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method (Sanger et al. 1977). Mutations which led
to restriction-site changes were confirmed by Southern
analysis of genomic DNA (Southern 1975). The sequences of both alleles were confirmed by sequencing
patient PNP cDNAs which had been cloned from an
independent PCR amplification.
Transfections
Site-directed mutagenesis (Taylor et al. 1985) of
the normal PNP cDNA was performed for each point
mutation by the Amersham oligonucleotide-directed
in vitro mutagenesis system, version 2. The directions
in the technical manual were followed. In brief, a mutant oligomer was synthesized and phosphorylated
with T4 polynucleotide kinase. This was annealed to
single-strand template (made from normal PNP cDNA
in pGEM3Zf- plasmid [Promega]). A mutant DNA
strand incorporating thionucleotides was synthesized
using the mutant oligomer as a primer. The nonmutant template was removed by nicking with Ncil enzyme and treatment with exonuclease III. The second
strand was then synthesized with DNA polymerase I
and ligated with T4 DNA ligase. Escherichia coli were
transformed with the resulting double-stranded plasmid containing the mutated cDNA insert. Mutant
PNP cDNAs were confirmed by sequencing (as above)
and then were cloned into the BamHI site of the pRK5
expression vector (Didsbury et al. 1989), obtained
from Dr. John Didsbury (Duke University). This vector contains the simian virus 40 enhancer and cytomegalovirus promoter. The 5' end of the PNP cDNA
sequence thus was the BamHI site at - 58 with respect
to the ATG at the initiation of translation. The 3' end
of the sequence was the final base pair in the normal
PNP cDNA pPNP1 described above. The BamHI site
at the 3' end was derived from the multiple cloning
site of the vector used in the site-directed mutagenesis
experiments. The cesium chloride-purified mutant
cDNAs were transfected into COS cells by the DEAEdextran method (McCutchan and Pagano 1968; Didsbury et al. 1989). In brief, 6-cm dishes of cells were
incubated in 2 ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium

765

(DMEM) with 10% NuSerum (Collaborative Research) and 0.1 mM chloroquine. DNA (3 gg) was
added in 120 gl DEAE dextran (6.6 mg/ml; Pharmacia) in Tris-buffered saline pH 7.5. After 3 h at
37°C, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were
treated at room temperature for 1 min with 1.5 ml of
10 g dimethyl sulfoxide/100 ml in PBS (PBS = 137
mM sodium chloride, 2.7 mM potassium chloride,
0.88 mM potassium phosphate, 6.6 mM sodium
phosphate, pH 7.5). Cells were then washed twice in
PBS and were then returned to medium (DMEM with
10% FCS and 50 mM HEPES). Forty-eight hours after
transfection, cells were washed with PBS and removed
from the plates with 0.04 g trypsin/100 ml, 0.5 mM
EDTA (Gibco), in 137 mM sodium chloride, 5.4 mM
potassium chloride, 5.5 mM glucose, 4.2 mM sodium
bicarbonate for 5 min at 37°C. Cells from each 60-mm
plate were resuspended at a concentration of 107 cells/
100 gl in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8,1 mM EDTA, 1 mM
2-mercaptoethanol; were subjected to three rounds of
alternate freezing and thawing in dry ice/ethanol; and
were stored in liquid nitrogen.

Enzyme Activity
Equivalent amounts of protein from each lysate
were applied to a Tris/EDTA/borate pH 8.8 agarose
gel (Innovative Chemistry, Marshfield, MA). The
samples were electrophoresed in a temperature-controlled (4°C) electrophoresis chamber (Innovative
Chemistry) at 160 V for 45 min. PNP activity was
detected by overlaying the gel with approximately 12
ml of a mixture containing 6 mM inosine, 7 mM sodium arsenate, 33 mM Tris pH 8, 0.017 units xanthine oxidase/ml, 0.7 mM nitro blue tetrazolium,
0.14 mM phenazine methosulfate, 0.5 g agarose/ 100
ml. PNP was detected as a purple spot after incubation
in the dark for 1 h at 370C.
Isoelectric Focusing
Lysates (approximately 80 gg of protein each) were
applied to a 1-mm slab isoelectric focusing gel of 5.5 %
acrylamide, 2.2% ampholytes (Resolytes pH 3.5-10;
Hoefer), 0.1% glycerol. The upper (cathode) buffer was 0.02 M NaOH; the lower (anode) buffer was
0.02 M acetic acid. The gel was run for 2 h at 20 W.
After the gel had run, enzyme activity was detected as
described above by overlaying the gel with a mixture
containing substrate, or immunoreactivity was detected by the immunoblotting procedure (see below).

766

Aust et al.

Immunoblot

Immunoreactivity was assessed by applying lysates
(approximately 80 ig of protein each) to isoelectric
focusing gels or to SDS-PAGE with 10% acrylamide
in the lower gel. The protein was transferred from the
gel to Immobilon-nitrocellulose (Millipore) by electroblotting for 2 h at 70 V in a Hoefer TE42 apparatus. The Immobilon was pretreated by being dipped
in water and then soaking for 5 min in transfer buffer
containing 39 mM glycine, 48 mM Tris, 1.3 mM SDS,
6.2 M methanol, pH 8.3. After transfer, the membrane was stained with India ink. Rabbit anti-PNP
IgG, a gift from Dr. William Osborne (University of
Washington, Seattle) (Osborne et al. 1977) was added
at a 10 -'dilution with 5 g Carnation nonfat dry milk/
100 ml in TBS-T (TBS-T = 20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 137
mM sodium chloride, 0.1 g Tween 20/100 ml) to
block nonspecific binding. The blot was hybridized
overnight at room temperature with the primary antibody, was washed three times in TBS-T, and hybridized for 2 h at room temperature with the secondary
antibody, [1251] donkey F(ab')2 anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham). The hybridized blot was again washed at room
temperature in TBS-T and was autoradiographed at
- 70'C for 10-14 d.
Results
Clinical History and Cell-Line Data

The clinical history, immune function studies, and
PNP levels in the patient, TP, have been described
elsewhere (Markert et al. 1987a). PNP activity levels
in the HLA-typed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines were 18
nm/h/mg protein and 1,900 nm/h/mg protein for
patient TP and her mother, respectively (normal range
2,496-8,276 nm/h/mg protein; n = 10). These results are consistent with those previously reported for
the red-cell-hemolysate PNP activity levels.
To study the enzyme activity and immunoreactivity
of PNP in B-cell lines derived from the patient and her
mother, lysates were applied to isoelectric focusing
gels (fig. 1). PNP activity was detected by overlaying
the gel with the substrate linked to a color reaction.
Duplicate gels were analyzed by immunoblotting.
PNP in cells derived from the patient's mother ran to
a similar position as did normal human PNP (fig. 1A);
however, the enzyme activity appeared to be less than
that of the control, consistent with the PNP activity
levels reported above. On immunoblotting, lysates of

cells derived from the mother revealed one band cor-

containing approximately 80 gg of protein were applied to an
isoelectric-focusing gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was overlaid
with the PNP substrate linked to a color reaction. This panel shows
both the absence of PNP activity in lysates of B-cell lines derived
from the patient and the presence of PNP activity in the lysates of
cells derived from her mother and from a normal control. The gels
were oriented with the cathode at the top. In the right-hand panel,
a duplicate isoelectric-focusing gel was blotted to a membrane and

from the patient had no immunoreactive material (fig.
1B). Material from the father was not available.
PNP mRNA Levels
Figure 2 shows RNA blot hybridization (Northern

blot) of poly(A + ) RNA isolated from the lymphoblastoid cell lines established from patient TP and her
mother. As shown in figure 2A, 32P-labeled full-length
PNP cDNA hybridized to mRNA of patient TP and
her mother at the same position as it did in the normal
control. As a control, the membrane was stripped and
probed with a 1-actin cDNA (fig. 2B). All samples
hybridized to the actin probe at the expected position
(approximately that of 18S RNA). The size of P-actin
mRNA is thought to be 1,761 nucleotides plus a poly
A tail (Ponte et al. 1984); and the size of PNP mRNA
is thought to be 1,500 nucleotides plus a poly A tail
(Jonsson et al. 1991). The PNP mRNA appears to

relative intensities of the bands with the PNP probe
are similar to those with the actin probe, indicating
that unequal amounts of poly(A +) RNA had been
loaded in each lane. Thus, the relative amounts of
PNP mRNA in cell lines derived from patient TP and
her mother were similar to that in control cell lines.
cDNA Sequencing

PNP cDNA from patient TP was amplified by PCR,
cloned, and sequenced; two mutant PNP alleles were
identified. Figure 3 shows a schematic representation
of the mutations and polymorphisms in the patient's
two alleles. It is noteworthy that both alleles share four
polymorphisms and one base-pair change resulting in
an amino acid substitution. Two of the polymorphisms, the double A in the 3' untranslated region and
the two tandem copies of a 10-bp sequence in the 5'

flanking region, have been reported elsewhere (Williams et al. 1984, 1987). The other two polymorphisms, at bp 60 and bp 171, have not been previously
reported. The nucleotide change leading to an amino
acid substitution which is common to both alleles occurs at nucleotide 151 (AGT to GGT) in exon 2 and
results in a change from Ser to Gly at position 51 in
the protein. In allele A, the base change at nucleotide
383 (GAT to GGT) in exon 4, a base change which
leads to an Asp-to-Gly substitution at amino acid position 128, results in the loss of an EcoRV restriction
site. A Southern blot (fig. 4) confirms this change and
demonstrates that allele A was inherited from the
mother. In allele B, the base change at nucleotide 701
(CGA to CCA) in exon 5, a base change which leads
to an Arg-to-Pro substitution at amino acid position
234, results in the loss of a TaqI restriction site. A
Southern blot (not shown) confirms this change, but,
because paternal blood was not available for this
study, we could not determine whether this change
was inherited from the father or was a spontaneous
mutation.

Figure 4 Southern analysis of genomic DNA, in examination of the point mutation at position 383. DNA was derived from
the individuals indicated. DNA was digested with EcoRV, electrophoresed on an agarose gel, and transferred to a membrane. The
left-hand panel shows the membrane after hybridization with a
radiolabeled PNP cDNA fragment containing part of exon 2, all of
exons 3 and 4, and part of exon 5. With the mutant PNP allele
found in patient TP and her mother, the loss of an EcoRV site in
exon 4 results in the appearance of the larger, 17-kb fragment. The
right-hand panel shows the same membrane after it was stripped
and reprobed with a genomic clone derived from the exon 2 region
of the adenosine deaminase gene. Only the band of the appropriate
size was detected, showing that the DNA had been digested fully.
The band at 8.2 kb in the left-hand panel likely represents DNA
cross-reactive with the PNP probe.

tient TP, we expressed the normal cDNA as well as
each mutant cDNA in vitro in COS cells. To create
the mutant cDNAs, we used site-directed mutagenesis
to create the specific mutation in a full-length normal
PNP cDNA. Creation of the mutant was verified by
sequencing across the site of the mutation. The mutant
cDNA was cloned into an expression vector. As controls, the normal PNP cDNA and an antisense PNP
cDNA were cloned into the expression vector. These
were transfected into the COS cells by a DEAE dextran

method. The cells were harvested at 48 h, and lysates
were examined by immunoblot and PNP-activity analysis.
Electrophoresis of the cell lysates separated the human and monkey PNP proteins. Enzyme detection by
a color reaction showed that mutant gene products
containing amino acid substitutions either at position
128 or at position 234 had no enzymatic activity (fig.
5A). Only the monkey PNP activity could be detected
in these lysates. The mutant gene product containing
the amino acid substitution at position 51 retained
enzyme activity; bands were detected at the positions
of both normal human and normal monkey PNP migration. Figure 5B shows an immunoblot done after
the lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The antibody used does not react significantly with monkey
PNP; only trace amounts of immunoreactive material
are found in untransfected COS lysates or COS lysates
from the antisense transfection experiments. Lysates
from cells transfected with the construct containing
the substitution at amino acid position 51 were immunoreactive as well as functionally active. Lysates from
cells transfected with constructs containing either the
mutation at amino acid position 128 or the mutation
at amino acid position 234 contained immunoreactive
PNP.
Discussion

We investigated the molecular defect in PNP-deficient patient TP. This patient's enzyme deficiency has
been documented previously by enzyme assays of red
blood cells, and we confirmed the deficiency by the
same assay of the B-lymphoblastoid cell line. Northern
analysis was used to categorize the type of defect which
led to a loss of PNP enzymatic function in our patient.
The detection of a normal amount of full-length PNP
mRNA in patient TP suggested that at least one of her
PNP alleles carried a point mutation. We were able, in
fact, to show that both alleles carried point mutations
which affected amino acid sequence. We were able to
show by site-directed mutagenesis that the mutations
in patient TP's PNP alleles disrupted PNP function. By
Southern analysis, we determined that allele A was
inherited from the patient's mother.
Ealick et al. (1990) have elucidated the crystallographic structure of the wild-type PNP enzyme. The
core of the PNP subunit consists of an eight-stranded
mixed beta-pleated sheet and a five-stranded mixed
beta-pleated sheet which form a distorted barrel structure. This barrel is surrounded by seven alpha-helices.

Figure 5
Structure/function analyses. Panel A shows the PNP enzymatic activity of various COS cell lysates, and panel B shows the
immunoreactivity of the same lysates. One to two microliters of each lysate was electrophoresed on an agarose gel and then was overlaid
with a solution containing PNP substrate (A). In addition, S pIl (approximately 80 fig of protein) was electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE and
then was transferred to a membrane and probed with rabbit anti-PNP IgG and an '25I-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (B). The lysates are as follows:
Lane 1, Human control cells. Lane 2, COS cells transfected with a vector containing PNP cDNA carrying the mutation at bp 151 (amino
acid position 51, Ser to Gly). Lane 3, COS cells transfected with a vector containing PNP cDNA carrying the mutation at bp 701 (amino
acid position 234, Arg to Pro). Lane 4, COS cells transfected with a vector containing PNP cDNA carrying the mutation at bp 383 (amino
acid position 128, Asp to Gly). Lane 5, COS cells transfected with a vector containing anti-sense PNP cDNA. Lane 6, COS cells transfected
with a vector containing sense PNP cDNA. Lane 7, COS cells. Gels were oriented with the cathode at the top. For both the activity gel
and the immunoblot, the same banding pattern was seen on lysates made from separate transfection experiments. Approximately equal
amounts of protein were added to each lane.

The Ser-to-Gly substitution at amino acid position 51
is in one of the connecting loops between two betapleated sheets and is quite removed from the substrate-binding site. These two amino acids are similar
in size and charge. It is not surprising, then, that the
PNP protein with Gly at amino acid position 51 retains
enzymatic activity and immunoreactivity. As this mutation was common to both alleles, it is possible that
this change represents a polymorphism within the
population.
In contrast, the Asp-to-Gly substitution at amino
acid position 128 affects the charge of the molecule
and results in loss of enzyme activity. The mutation in
allele B leads to an Arg-to-Pro substitution at amino
acid position 234. This particular amino acid is in a
four-amino-acid sequence which makes a sharp turn
between an alpha-helix and a beta-pleated sheet (Ealick et al. 1990). The positive charge on the arginine
is probably important for stabilizing this sequence and
for allowing proper folding. A proline would undoubtedly disrupt this sharp turn.
Since we detect no immunoreactive PNP in the patient cell lysates but do detect it in the COS lysates, we

believe that both mutants may be quickly degraded
within the cell. These mutant proteins are found in the
COS cells because their expression is driven at high
levels off our vector. The finding of immunoreactive
PNP in lysates from cells transfected with the PNP
alleles mutant at either residue 128 or residue 234 is
similar to Williams et al.'s (1987) finding that PNP
carrying a substitution from Glu to Lys at amino acid
position 89 lacked enzymatic activity but remained
immunoreactive although the protein focused at a
more basic pI than did normal PNP.
We compared this PNP-deficient patient's mutations with point mutations found in other diseases. A
review of published point mutations in disease genes
has shown that 63 % of point mutations are transitions
(Cooper and Krawczak 1990). In this patient, four
of the five mutations were transitions. Cooper and
Krawczak's (1990) review also showed that 32% of
all point mutations in disease genes occurred in a CpG
sequence. These mutations (CG to TG or CG to CA)
are consistent with the methylation-mediated deamination of 5-methyl cytosine (Cooper and Youssoufian
1988; Cooper and Krawczak 1990). As CpG sequences

Aust et al.

tend to be hot spots for mutation, mutations at these
sites are often found in many individuals. None of
the point mutations described in the present paper
occurred at a CpG sequence.
In PNP deficiency, one must consider the effect of
trimer formation on enzyme activity. It has been suggested, although not formally proved, that trimer formation is necessary for enzyme activity (Ealick et al.
1990). Heterotrimers have been found in parents of
children with PNP deficiency. These trimers contain
one or two normal subunits mixed with two or one
mutant subunits. Osborne et al. (1977) showed that
parents of one PNP-deficient child expressed some immunoreactive PNP (14% of total) which migrated at a
position in native gels which is consistent with trimers
composed of mixtures of mutant and normal subunits.
The PNP activity of the parents was between onequarter and one-third of normal. One can postulate
that the mixed heterotrimers were responsible for the
parents' PNP activity being less than half of normal.
This finding contrasts with our results. The two mutations (substitutions at amino acid positions 128 and
234) which cause lack of enzyme activity do not result
in accumulation of any immunoreactive material in
the patient's or mother's cells. On isoelectric-focusing
gels, PNP from the patient's mother runs as a single
normal band. In isoelectric focusing, heterotrimers
containing normal and mutant subunits should have
been detected by the presence of an additional band(s)
located closer to the cathode than the normal trimer
(Williams et al. 1987). Presumably, the mutant PNP
is rapidly degraded. Perhaps because of this, the PNP
activity of maternal cell lysates is approximately half
of normal, not less than this.
It is interesting to correlate the known PNP mutations with the clinical data on patients. Although early
reports suggested that B-cell function was normal or
increased in PNP deficiency, more recent studies have
shown that B-cell function can be disrupted as well
(Markert 1991). This is the case with patient TP. She
has had normal B-cell counts but significantly depressed immunoglobulin levels (Markert et al. 1 987a).
In contrast, the only other patient whose molecular
defect has been characterized had normal B-cell function (Giblett et al. 1975). The immunologic differences between these patients may be secondary to
genes other than PNP which vary between the two
patients.
In summary, TP is only the second patient whose
PNP deficiency has been characterized at the molecular level. We identified one point mutation which does

not disrupt the protein's enzymatic activity and immunoreactivity and which may reflect a polymorphism
within the population. In addition, we found two new
point mutations within the PNP gene which result in
proteins without enzymatic function. Although immunoreactivity was found in lysates of cells transfected
with the mutant alleles, the patient's cells had no detectable immunoreactive PNP protein. This implies
that these mutant proteins may be rapidly degraded in
the cell.
