Abstract
Germ line p53 point mutations have been reported for some families
with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a syndrome characterized by a dominanti}'
inherited increased susceptibility for the development of early age of
onset neoplasms of diverse origin in multiple family members. All of the
initially reported pS3 germ line mutations have been found exclusively
within a single conserved, nonpolymorphic region of the gene between
Condons 245 and 258. The restricted distribution of these inherited
mutations has led to speculation that germ line pS3 mutations have
unique properties |B. Vogelstein, Nature (Lond.), 348: 681-682, 1990].
We report here on the identification of a pS3 germ line mutation at codon
133 (ATG â€”¿Â»
ACG) in nine members of an extended Li-Fraumeni
syndrome family. This mutation leads to an amino acid substitution in
the protein and is shown to completely cosegregate with Li-Fraumeni
syndrome associated cancer in this family. Its location extends the region
of the p53 gene where inherited mutations predisposing to cancer are
observed and suggests that their distribution may be diverse.

Introduction
Point mutations within the p53 tumor suppressor gene are a
common finding in a variety of sporadic tumors in man (see
Ref. l for review). Additionally, p53 germ line mutations have
been identified in a familial form of cancer known as LiFraumeni syndrome. Most tumor associated mutations and all
reported germ line mutations occur within well defined nonpolymorphic regions of the gene (1-3). The p53 gene has been
conserved during evolution. Comparison of the amino acid
sequence in various species reveals significant nonrandom homology concentrated in five discrete blocks (conserved blocks
I-V). These regions are believed to be important protein func
tional domains (4). Conserved blocks II-V, which are scattered
throughout exons 4-8, have been implicated as the most com
mon sites for tumor associated p53 mutations (1). LFS' is a
familial form of cancer in which affected family members
display diverse tumor types including soft tissue sarcomas,
breast carcinoma, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, leukemias, and
adrenocortical carcinoma. Cancer commonly develops at an
early age and additional diverse primary tumors commonly
develop in survivors of the initial cancer. Segregation of tumors
within these families is consistent with an autosomal dominant
mode of inheritance of cancer susceptibility (5-7). The p53
germ line mutations which have been previously identified in
LFS families (2, 3) all cluster within a span of 42 nucleotides
of conserved block IV and have been limited to one of four
codons (Fig. 1). These point mutations result in amino acid
substitutions in the protein and are believed to represent loss
of function mutations leading to an increased susceptibility for

cancer in carriers, as would be predicted by the two-hit model
of Knudson (8) and DeMars (9). The significance of the re
stricted distribution of these initially reported germ line muta
tions is uncertain but has led to speculation that germ line p53
mutations may have unique properties (10). The overall purpose
of this study was to test for germ line mutations in thep53 gene
in families exhibiting a genetic predisposition to cancer. One
such mutation in an extended cancer prone family is described
here.
Materials and Methods
Our study population consists of an extended LFS family in which
12 members, with various cancers, were identified over 4 generations
descending from a woman who died of breast cancer at the age of 52.
This family was initially ascertained through a systematic study of
families of 3-year survivors of childhood soft tissue sarcomas and
provided strong statistical evidence for an autosomal dominant mode
of inheritance for cancer susceptibility in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (7).
Genomic DNA was extracted by standard techniques (11) from
lymphocytes obtained from peripheral blood samples. The conserved
block regions of the gene were amplified by PCR. A 1.1-kilobase
fragment containing conserved blocks II and III spanning an area of
genomic DNA from codon 51 (exon 4) to codon 199 (exon 6) was
amplified with primers (PA3) 5'-ACA ATG GTT CAC TGA AGA
CCC AGG-3' and (PA8) 5'-CTT CCA CTC GGA TAA GAT GC-3'.
A second 638-base pair fragment containing conserved blocks IV and
V comprised all of exon 7 and 8 and was amplified with primers (PAS)
5'-TCT CCT AGG TTC GCT CTG AC-3' and (PA6) 5'-CTT ACC
TCG CTT ACT GCT CC-3'. Multiple internal sequencing primers
were designed in order to obtain sequencing data on both strands for
all four conserved blocks (Table 1). Nucleotide sequencing was per
formed by use of the dideoxynucleotide chain terminating method (12)
and was carried out directly on the double stranded PCR amplification
products (13). Since sequencing was performed directly on PCR am
plified products, the resulting sequencing ladder would represent the
consensus sequence of the entire population of DNA molecules. Ran
dom PCR related misincorporation errors should not be detectable
unless they occur during the initial PCR cycles (14). To rule out this
possibility each sample was amplified in triplicate and the products
were pooled prior to sequencing. The entire amplification and sequenc
ing process was done in duplicate on those individuals found to carry
the codon 133 mutation. Both DNA strands were sequenced in order
to confirm the mutation.

Results and Discussion
Twenty-eight members of this family (Fig. 2) were examined
for the possibility of p53 germ line mutations in conserved
blocks II-V. Eight of these family members were affected with
cancer, seven with various LFS associated neoplasms and one
with Hodgkin's disease. A p53 germ line point mutation was
identified at codon 133 of conserved block II (ATG -Â»ACG)
and shown to be present in the heterozygous condition in each
of nine family members (Fig. 3). All affected members with
LFS associated tumors were heterozygous for this p53 muta
tion; they include the proband (IV-12), his sister (IV-13), four

paternal aunts (III-3, 5, 7, 9), and a paternal male cousin (III1). The mutation was not present in family member IV-10 who
was affected with Hodgkin's disease. Two family members who
were not affected with cancer were heterozygous for the codon
133 mutation. The two unaffected carriers, proband's father
(III-13) and paternal female cousin (IV-6), do demonstrate
mendelian segregation of the mutation in their immediate fam
ilies and may be at increased risk for cancer.
Eighteen family members, including all spouses who married
into the cancer prone family, did not have cancer and did not
carry the p53 germ line mutation. There is complete association
of this mutation with LFS associated neoplasms in this family
(Table 2). Two cancers not commonly associated with LFS
were identified in this family. Hodgkin's disease was diagnosed
in the proband's paternal female cousin (IV-10) but neither she
or her parents carry the codon 133 mutation. Additionally, a
paternal male first cousin of the proband's father (III-l) was
diagnosed with colon cancer and soft tissue sarcoma at 39 years
of age and was found to carry the codon 133 mutation. These
data would seem to indicate that Hodgkin's disease is not a
component cancer of LFS in this family but colon cancer may

be. No other p53 mutations were identified in conserved blocks
II-V. Additionally, 11 unrelated individuals who were not
affected with cancer and had no family history of excess cancer
were examined and found to have wild type p53 sequences in
conserved blocks II-V. These data are consistent with the
nonpolymorphic nature of these conserved regions (2).
Current evidence suggests that the normal p53 protein is
essential for normal cell growth, perhaps as a negative regulator
of the cell cycle, and that its alteration or inactivation is
necessary for the development of malignancy (reviewed in Ref.
15). The codon 133 mutation is located in a conserved domain
and would likely lead to altered protein function. The base
transition of T to C leads to the amino acid substitution of a
hydrophilic threonine for a hydrophobic methionine. Tumor

specific mutations within this region have been shown to lead
to altered protein function with loss of tumor suppressor activ
ity (16-18). The cosegregation of this p53 germ line mutation
with all LFS associated neoplasms in this family strongly
suggests that the mutation is functionally significant and that
carriers are at an increased risk for developing cancer. Interest
ingly, at the time of the proband's diagnosis, none of the
ascertained family members depicted in Fig. 2 (III and IV) had
yet developed cancer. This observation underscores the diffi
culty in attempting to identify Li-Fraumeni syndrome patients.
The location of a p53 mutation in conserved block II is
unique for a germ line mutation but is not uncommon for
sporadic tumors. A p53 mutation in human tumor tissue from
sporadic cancer of the colon was previously reported for codon
133 (19). It differs from the germ line mutation reported here
in that it involved an A to T transversion of the first base of
codon 133 (ATG â€”¿>
TTG) and results in a different amino acid
substitution (methionine â€”¿Â»
leucine). Similarly, two of the pre
viously reported p53 germ line mutations occur in codons (245,
248) which have also been implicated in sporadic tumors (20).
This study indicates that LFS associated germ line p53 muta
tions are not restricted to a specific conserved region of the
gene, as might be concluded from the clustering of initially
reported germ line mutations in conserved block IV. Addition
ally, the fact that codons 133, 245, and 248 have been shown
to be mutated in both hereditary and sporadic cancer would
suggest that germ line mutations may not be unique. It is
reasonable to suspect the p53 germ line mutations in LFS are
as diverse in nature and location as those that occur in a variety
of sporadic tumors.
