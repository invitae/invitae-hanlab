Summary. Ornithine transcarbamylase ( O T C ) deficiency is the most c o m m o n inborn error of the urea cycle
in humans and is responsible for lethal neonatal hypera m m o n e m i a in males. Partial O T C deficiency also occurs
in females and can be responsible for life-threatening
h y p e r a m m o n e m i c comas in heterozygotes. The cosegregation of the trait with a 5.8-kb abnormal MspI
fragment in an affected family led us to hypothesize that
this unexpected migration pattern was related to the
mutation event in this particular family. Using polymerase chain reaction amplification of the specific
m R N A derived from a post-mortem biopsy of the liver,
we found that the MspI site located in the seventh exon
of the gene was abolished and we finally identified a
C-to-T transition at codon 225 of the c D N A , changing a
proline to a leucine in the protein. Subsequent digestion
of amplified exon 7 using the restriction enzyme MspI allowed direct screening for the mutant genotype during
the next pregnancy. The present study supports the view
that direct detection of the mutant genotype using either
Southern blotting or digestion of amplified exons of
the gene can contribute to genetic counselling in noninformative families. Finally, since MspI digestions are
routinely p e r f o r m e d for restriction fragment length polymorphism-based family studies in O T C deficiency, we
suggest that the possible presence of the 5.8-kb abnormal fragment should be investigated on Southern blots
of affected individuals.

Introduction
Ornithine transcarbamylase ( O T C ) deficiency is a severe
X-linked defect of the urea cycle in humans and is responsible for lethal neonatal h y p e r a m m o n e m i a in affected hemizygous males. As a consequence of lyonization, partial O T C deficiency is also observed in heterozygotes (Jackson et al. 1986) and is responsible for various clinical symptoms (Batshaw et al. 1986). Shortly

after the relevant c D N A became available (Horwich et
al. 1984), the O T C gene was found to span 73 kb and was
m a p p e d to the short arm of c h r o m o s o m e X (Xp21.1;
H a t a et al. 1988; Lingren et al. 1984). Subsequently,
prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection became feasible
using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)based family studies (Fox et al. 1986). Moreover, direct
molecular detection of the mutation has been occasionally achieved by Southern analysis. Indeed, approximately 1 0 % - 1 5 % of patients have either deletions within the gene or point mutations that alter a TaqI restriction endonuclease site (Rozen et al. 1985; Maddalena et
al. 1988; H a t a et al. 1989; Lee and Nussbaum 1989;
G r o m p e et al. 1989, 1990). H e r e , we show that the
mutation at a MspI ( C C G G ) site in the coding region of
the gene can be detected by Southern blot analysis and
used as the disease-marker for prenatal diagnosis in an
affected family. This result supports the view that C p G
doublets are hot-spots of mutations in the O T C gene and
that direct detection of the mutant genotype can contribute to genetic counselling in non-informative families.

Case report
The proband (III1, Fig. 1) was the first child of unrelated parents,
and was born after a full-term pregnancy and normal delivery
(birth weight: 3490g). He did well during the first 3 days of life,
then he lost appetite and developed hypotonia and drowsiness.
Vomiting, seizures and apneas occurred thereafter, then he rapidly
fell into a deep coma and died at 9 days of age. Elevated blood ammonia (775 tamol/l, control below 30) was highly suggestive of a urea
cycle disorder, and increased urinary orotic acid (33.6 lamol/mmol
creatinine, normal below 6) with undetectable plasma citrulline led
to the diagnosis of OTC deficiency. A post-mortem liver biopsy
confirmed OTC deficiency with no detectable residual activity of
the enzyme.
The maternal uncle of the proband (II3. Fig. 1) and his maternal great uncle (not shown) also died in the neonatal period but no
diagnosis was made. Finally, both the mother (112) and the maternal grandmother of the proband (I2) underwent a protein loading
test (1 g/kg), A dramatic increment of urinary orotic acid in the 6-h
period following the protein Ioad confirmed their status as carriers
(15.0 and 15.1 lag/mgcreatinine for I2 and II2, respectively: normal
below 6: Pelet et al. 1990:Bonaiti-Pelli6 et al. 1990).

Materials and methods

Total DNA isolated from circulating leukocytes, chorion villi, cultured fibroblasts and post-mortem biopsy specimens of the liver
was digested with restriction enzyme MspI. electrophoresed on a
0.6% agarose gel. transferred onto nylon filters and hybridized
with the full-length OTC cDNA probe (Horwich et al. 1984). Two
RFLPs produced by the enzyme MspI have been described at the
OTC locus. The variant bands in one polymorphic set are
AI = 6.6 kb and A2 = 6.2 kb in length. The bands in the second set
are B1 = 5.1 kb and B2 = 4.4kb (Fox et al. 1986). The OTC probe
also detects five constant bands of 14. 5.4, 3.3, 2.3 and 1.9kb
(Grompe et al. 1990).
For mutant cDNA synthesis, the specific mRNA extracted
from a frozen biopsy specimen of the liver was reverse-transcribed
in cDNA using a specific oligonucleotide primer distal to the termination codon (primer B = nt 1066-1086: 5' TTCT-FGACAAGTAACACAACA 3', Fig. 2), and amplified using primer B and a
second primer, proximal to the initiation codon (primer A = nt
-21 to - I : 5' CCTTTACACAATTAAAAGAAG 3') (Fig. 2:
Horwich et al. 1984: Hata et al. 1988). The amplification product
was then purified and cloned in the double-stranded phage M13
for further sequencing by the dideoxy termination chain technique. For specific amplification of exon 7 of the OTC gene
(Fig. 2), two primers flanking the invariant Mspl site at nt 675-678
were synthesized (primer C = CCTTCCTCCTI'TAGGGTTAT3',

Results

S o u t h e r n blot analysis of g e n o m i c D N A digested with
restriction e n z y m e MspI showed that p r o b a n d III1 was
a hemizygote for R F L P haplotype A1 B1 at the O T C locus
and that the 5.4-kb invariant f r a g m e n t normally located
between the two p o l y m o r p h i c sets A and B was missing
(Fig. 1). Instead, a 5.8-kb a b n o r m a l f r a g m e n t was detected both in the patient and in carrier individuals (I2
and II2, Fig. 1). W e therefore hypothesized that this abnormal b a n d was related to the m u t a t i o n event in this
family. F o r this reason, the amplified c D N A of the proband was digested with the e n z y m e MspI. This e n z y m e
normally recognizes two C C G G sites in the O T C c D N A
(at nt 147-150 and nt 675-678, respectively) and cleaves
the 1 107-bp amplified c D N A in three fragments of 167,
527 and 4 1 3 b p , respectively (Fig. 2). In the p r o b a n d ,
however, only two fragments of 167 and 9 4 0 b p were
detected (Fig. 2), thus supporting the view that the abn o r m a l M s p I site was the distal site, located in the
seventh exon of the gene (nt 675-678). F u r t h e r sequence
analysis of the whole coding region revealed a C - t o - T
substitution at nt 676, resulting in a proline to leucine
transition at c o d o n 225 of the m R N A (Fig. 3). Convincing evidence that the C-to-T transition at c o d o n 225 was
the primary disease-causing mutation was provided by
complete sequence analysis in the p r o b a n d , showing
that, apart from the C - t o - T transition, his c D N A was
similar to the wild-type sequence.
In o r d e r to d e m o n s t r a t e the co-segregation of the 5.8kb a b n o r m a l f r a g m e n t with the m u t a t i o n at c o d o n 225 in
this family, amplified exon 7 of the O T C gene was digested in the p r o b a n d and in the h e t e r o z y g o t e carriers.
Figures 2, 3 show that the 85-bp amplified f r a g m e n t was
normally cleaved into two fragments of 61 and 2 4 b p ,
respectively, whereas no cleavage was o b s e r v e d in the
p r o b a n d . T h e h e t e r o z y g o t e carriers displayed a combination of digested and non-digested fragments (Fig. 3).
Since the a b n o r m a l restriction pattern was clearly associated with the deleterious mutation in this family, this

feature was used as a genetic m a r k e r for prenatal diagnosis during the next pregnancy. The fetus III2, a female,
was found to be normal both by Southern blotting (Fig. 1,
lane 5) and enzymatic cleavage of amplified exon 7
(Fig. 3, lane 7).

Indeed, this abnormal restriction pattern is the hallmark
of a deleterious mutation in the coding region (exon 7)
of the O T C gene. Secondly, this study is consistent with
the observation that C p G doublets are particularly susceptible to C-to-T transition mutations caused by deamination of a methylated C in either the sense or the
antisence strand ( C o o p e r and Krawczak 1990). Indeed,
about half the cytosines of the genome are 5-methylated,
mainly when they belong to a 5' C p G 3' doublet. The
accidental deamination of a 5-methyl cytosine leads to a
transition to thymine, which may not be excised by the
D N A repair system, thus resulting in an irreversible
point mutation ( C o o p e r and Youssoufian 1988; Coulondre et al. 1978). There are several C p G doublets in
the coding region of the O T C gene including four TaqI
restriction sites ( T C G A ) and two MspI restriction sites
( C C G G ) . Base changes altering TaqI sites have previously been reported in exons 1, 3, 5 and 9 of the gene
and m a k e up an important subgroup in O T C deficiency
( G r o m p e et al. 1990). Considering the high frequency of
mutations of C p G doublets at TaqI sites, one can hypothesize that point mutations at MspI sites of the gene are
also relatively frequent.
Finally, it is worth keeping in mind that, in several
families, heterozygous carriers cannot be studied by
R F L P - b a s e d D N A diagnosis because there are no informative polymorphisms in that particular family. Direct
detection of the mutant genotype can help solve these
diagnostic problems in uninformative families or when
the carrier status cannot be clarified by standard biochemical techniques (Pelet et a1.1990). Prenatal and carrier diagnosis can be greatly simplified by direct detection
of mutant genotypes in families with such alterations, as
shown in the present study using the restriction enzyme

MspI.
Discussion
The co-segregation of O T C deficiency with an abnormal
MspI fragment of the O T C gene in a large pedigree led
us to hypothesize that this unexpected migration pattern
was related to the mutation event both in affected males
and in heterozygote carriers in this family. Since two
MspI sites are present in the coding region of the O T C
gene, we first submitted the amplified c D N A derived
from a p o s t - m o r t e m liver biopsy to digestion with the
restriction enzyme MspI followed by gel electrophoresis.
Using this procedure, we were able to demonstrate that
the MspI site located in the seventh exon of the gene was
abolished and to identify a C-to-T transition at codon
225 of the c D N A . This mutation resulted in a neutral to
acid aminoacid substitution in the protein. The rest of
the coding sequence was similar to that of normal individuals.
The present observation deserves particular attention
for several reasons. First, this is the first report of a
mutation at an MspI site of the O T C gene, associated
with this disease. Since MspI digestions are currently
p e r f o r m e d for R F L P - b a s e d family studies in O T C deficiency, we suggest that it may be worth investigating the
absence of the 5.4-kb constant fragment and the presence of a 5.8-kb abnormal fragment on Southern blots.
