These experiments tested whether Tc cells specific for foreign antigen (X) plus self H-2 adsorbed to macrophage monolayers displaying (a) X with allogeneic H-2; (B) self H-2 alone; (c) X plus self H-2. Specific adsorption occurred only in case (c), a result compatible with altered self and requiring further operational assumptions in dual recognition models.
