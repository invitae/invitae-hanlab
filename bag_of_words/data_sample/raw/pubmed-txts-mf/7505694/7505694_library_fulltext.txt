Since the cloning of the CFTR gene in 1989 more than 300 cystic
fibrosis (CF) mutations have been identified (ref. 1 and CF
Genetic Analysis Consortium). The majority of the mutations
detected correlate with a severe clinical presentation of the
disease, which is normally associated with pancreatic
insufficiency and severe or moderate lung involvement. As the
majority of CF mutations are uncommon it is difficult to obtain
a reasonable phenotype/genotype correlation, which would serve
to asses the severity of the different CF mutations. The complete
identification of the CF genotypes in the different CF patients,
in which a severe mutation is known to be present, provides an
important resource for the characterization of the level of severity
of the other mutation in the patient (2). In other cases,
homozygosity for a given mutation can serve in the analysis of
severity of CF mutations, although patients homozygous for a
mild mutation are rare (3). We report here, a new missense
mutation (P205S) in the first transmembrane domain of the CFTR
gene, which is associated with a mild CF phenotype, pancreatic
sufficiency and without gastrointestinal symptoms. Mutation
P205S was identified, in one patient, in exon 6a, after SSCP
analysis of 20 exons of theCT77?gene ( 1 - 7 , 10-14a, 15-16,
and 17b-21) in a panel of 40 unrelated Spanish CF patients.
Further association of P205S with CFTR microsatellites (4) and
screening in a large sample of Spanish CF chromosomes were
performed.
Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes
according to standard protocols. PCR conditions were:
denaturation at 95°C for 30 sec, annealing at 56°C for 30 sec
and extension at 74°C for 40 sec in 35 cycles. The reaction mix
contained 0.1 yX of [a-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 1 yX of PCR
buffer (Perkin Elmer Cetus N808-0006), 60 yM of each dNTP,
10 pmols of each primer, 100 ng of DNA and 1 unit of Taq DNA
polymerase in a final volume of 10 yX. The primers used were
6ai-5 and 6ai-3 (5).
After PCR, DNA products of exon 6a were digested with
MbdQ.. SSCP electrophoresis was run at 4°C on a 6%
nondenaturing poly aery lamide gel without glycerol, at 30 watts
for 5 hours. One abnormal band was detected in the samples
analysed. The individual with the abnormal band was PCRamplified and then purified with Strategene PrimeErase Quik
columns (#400705). Direct automatic sequencing was performed
with 3.5 pmols of sequencing primer, and 7 yX of the purified
PCR product, using Taq DyeDeoXy™ Terminator Cycle

Sequencing Kit (ABI) (#401113), according to the
manufacturer's recommendations. Sequencing conditions were
denaturation at 96°C for 30 sec, annealing at 50°C for 30 sec
and extension at 60°C for 4 min for 28 cycles.
In the analysis of exon 6a we have detected one sample
(91-229) with an abnormal SSCP-migration pattern. Direct
sequencing of the sample, using primers 6ai-5 and 6ai-3, showed
a C to T substitution at nucleotide 745 that replaces serine with
proline at codon 205 (mutation P205S) (Figure 1). This causes
the substitution of a polar amino acid for a non-polar one, in
a membrane spanning region of the first transmembrane domain,
which could affect the normal folding of the CFTR protein and
be the cause of the CF phenotype. P205S does not affect any
restriction enzyme site and it was found associated with haplotype
1 6 - 4 4 - 1 3 (TVS8CA-IVS17BTA-IVS17BCA) (4). For a rapid
screening of the mutation, we designed a mutagenesis primer (6)
E6XD1 5'-TGGCACATTTCGTGTGAATCGC-3', which
creates a Xmnl site if the change C to T, that leads to P205S,
is present. Screening of mutation P205S in our sample of CF
chromosomes was partially based on its association with the
microsatellite haplotype 16—44-13. CF patients with this
haplotype were PCR amplified using the E6XD1 mutagenesis
primer and primer 6ai-3 and digested with Xmnl. A total of three
independent P205S alleles were found in the sample analysed
(3/950) with a final estimated frequency of 0.3%.
Clinical data (Table 1) were available for four CF patients
carrying mutation P205S (3 were from the same family). The
patients were between 4 and 24 years-old, 2 of which were
diagnosed when they were 12 and 15 years of age. None of the
patients have had gastrointestinal symptoms or pancreatic disease.
All patients have had lung colonization with bacterial pathogens,
but they have an excellent general status. Patient (91—394) was
also diagnosed for congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens,
which has been associated with mutations in the CFTR gene (7).
The mutations in the other chromosome of the patients, for which
clinical data were available, were AF508 or 36O1-111G->C.
AF508 is known to be a severe mutation and 3601-111G—C
is also associated with a severe CF phenotype with pancreatic
insufficiency and lung disease (M.Chilldn and X.Estivill,
unpublished).
Clinical presentations of patients carrying P205S suggest its
association with a mild CF phenotype, with pancreatic suffiency
and without gastrointestinal symptoms. The CF phenotype could

possibly be explained by the substitution of a non-polar by a polar
amino acid in a membrane spanning region of a transmembrane
domain. The proline in codon 205 is conserved in the CFTR gene
of Human, Mouse, Bovine, Xenopus and Dogfish (8). The change
could alter thefoldingof the CFTR protein and so, weakly affect,
but not completely, the correct functioning of the CFTR protein.
Functional studies of this mutation, regarding the chloride channel
activity of CFTR for P2O5S, should provide further insights about
its role in the CF phenotype.
