Summary. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, an inherited
connective tissue disease, is usually caused by mutations
in the gene for type III collagen. Here, we describe a
glycine to glutamic acid substitution in a patient with this
syndrome. Previous studies had shown that fibroblasts
from the patient, his mother and brother secreted a reduced amount of type III collagen and also produced an
overmodified form of the protein that was preferentially
retained intracellularly. Peptide mapping experiments
indicated that the mutation was located within cyanogen bromide peptide 9. This was supported by chemical
cleavage analysis and sequencing of cDNA encoding this
region. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridisation of
genomic DNA confirmed that a G to A mutation converted Gly 847 to Glu. The mutation was present in two
other affected family members and also in a third, who
was clinically unaffected. Further analysis of this unaffected individual revealed reduced mutant:normal
ratios in D N A obtained from both blood and hair samples, showing that she was mosaic for the mutation.

Introduction
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV (EDS IV) is characterised by thin fragile skin, with easily visible veins and prematurely aged hands and feet (Beighton 1970; McKusick
1972), and is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant
fashion. The tendency to rupture arterial vessels and
hollow organs makes this a particularly life-threatening
disease. In most patients, tissues are depleted in type III
collagen and their fibroblasts secrete reduced quantities
of type III collagen (Pope et al. 1975). Linkage of the
disease to the type III collagen gene (COL3A1) has since
been established (Tsipouras et al. 1986; Nicholls et al.
1988) and various mutations of the gene have been characterised. These include deletions (Vissing et al. 1991;
Lee et al. 1991b), skipping of exons (Kuivaniemi et al.

1990; Cole et al. 1990; Lee et al. 1991a) and single base
mutations (Tromp et al. 1989a, b; Richards et al. 1991).
All the point mutations substitute a helical glycine residue
with a bulkier amino acid, and are analagous to those
mutations in the two type I collagen genes (COL1A1
and COL1A2) that cause various types of osteogenesis
imperfecta (OI) as reviewed by Kuivaniemi et al. (1991).
Point mutations in codons for glycine can lead to its substitution by any of 8 other amino acids or can alternatively introduce a premature termination codon. All
of these, except the substitution of glycine by glutamic
acid or tryptophan, have been observed in either the
COL1A1, COL1A2, COL2A1 or COL3A1 genes (Kuivaniemi et al. 1991). The substitution of a glycine residue delays the formation of the collagen triple helix
allowing additional time for post-translational modification of lysine residues, prior to helix formation (Bonadio
and Byers 1985; Bateman et al. 1986). These overmodified collagens are poorly secreted and are either
retained within the cell or degraded. They also migrate
more slowly in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels than normal collagen. Since overmodification occurs N-terminal to the site of glycine substitution, it can be used as a marker to indicate the approximate position of the mutation (Bonadio and Byers
1985).
We have previously described an individual with
EDS IV who presented with exophthalmos from a spontaneous carotid-cavernous fistula, which was successfully
embolised and occluded (Fox et al. 1988). Compared
with controls, the proband's type III collagen was poorly
secreted, and the protein, which was preferentially retained within the cell layer, migrated slowly in SDS polyacrylamide gels. His mother and only sibling were also
deficient in type III collagen but had only minor clinical
changes, such as thin skin and joint laxity (Fox et al.
1988). The mother has since died, aged 50 years, from
post-operative complications following rupture of the
bowel. Here, we characterise a novel glycine substitution in the type III collagen of this family. We also show
that the mutation must have arisen during the embryogenesis of the proband's maternal grandmother, who is
clinically unaffected, but mosaic for the mutation.

Materials and methods

Results and discussion

Cell culture

The type III collagen from the proband was resolved
into 2 bands on SDS gels, one normal and one slowmigrating. Incubation of cells with ~a'-dipyridyl completely abolished the slow-migrating mutant protein, indicating that it was overmodified (data not shown). In
situ cyanogen bromide digestion of the proband's type
III collagen showed significant differences from the normal pattern (Fig. 1). Instead of a single spot for CB5 and
CB9, there was a marked distortion of the pattern in this
region, with 2 spots in the slow-migrating component.
The partial cleavage product al(III) CB4-5 was also
present as 2 spots. This evidence indicated that both
CB5 and CB9 were present as overmodified forms in the
mutant protein, suggesting that the mutation was in the
most carboxy-terminal peptide CB9 (Fig. 2). However,
it did not exclude the possibility of a mutation in the Cpropeptide.
To confirm its location, cDNA encoding CB9 from
the proband was mapped for mutations by chemical
cleavage analysis. Labelled wild type cDNA was used as
a probe, with hydroxylamine as the modifying agent
(Fig. 3). Hydroxylamine modifies any mismatched C

Fibroblasts were established, maintained and metabolically labelled as previously described (Nicholls et al. 1988).

Cyanogen bromide mapping
The radio-labelled normal and mutant ul(III) chains isolated from
fibroblasts were separated in 5% polyacrylamide-SDS gels using
delayed reduction of disulphide bonds (Sykes et al. 1976). After
digestion in situ with excess cyanogen bromide, gel fragments
were re-equilibrated with gel sample buffer and electrophoresed in
10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels using the Laemmli buffer system
(Laemmli 1970). Radiolabelled peptides were identified by fluorography,

RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and amplification
Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from skin fibroblasts by lysing
the cells with NP40 containing vanadyl ribonucleoside complexes
(Maniatis et al. 1982). This total RNA was used for first-strand
synthesis of cDNA coding for CB9 and was amplified using the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Saiki et al. 1985) as previously
described (Richards et al. 1991).

Chemical cleavage mapping
Chemical cleavage mapping of cDNA was performed on cDNA
encoding CB9 from the proband as previously described (Richards
et al. 1991).
Modification and cleavage of heteroduplexes with hydroxylamine and piperidine was essentially as described by Roberts et
al. (1989) except that yeast tRNA was used as a carrier instead of
mussel glycogen.

Subcloning and sequencing
Gel-purified PCR products were subcloned into M13mp18 and
sequenced as previously described (Richards et al. 1991).

Amplification of genomic D N A
DNA was prepared from either blood lymphocytes as described by
Nicholls et al. (1988) or from single hair follicles as described by
Lench et al. (1988). The region of COL3A1 that contained the mutation was amplified using the primers B5C (5'GGTCTI'CCTGGTCTGGCTGGTACA3'-sense) and B3D (5'AGGAGAGCAAq'TTTCACCACGATC3'-antisense), under conditions previously described for the amplification of genomic DNA (Richards
et al. 1991).

Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridisations
Amplified DNA was Southern blotted using standard protocols.
Alternatively, DNA was denatured with 0.3 M NaOH at 37~ for
10min, neutralised with an equal volume of 0.6M TRIS-HC1
pH7.4, 1.5 M NaC1, and transferred as 6 identical samples to nitrocellulose by slot-blotting. After blotting, the filters were dried and
baked at 80~ for 2 h.
The oligonucleotides ASOG (5'GGAAACCCTGGATCA3')
and ASOA (5'GAAAACCCTGGATCA3') were end-labelled
with ,/32p ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Maniatis et al. 1982)
and hybridised to the filter-bound DNA for 6 h. After hybridisation, the filters were washed with tetramethylammonium chloride
under the conditions described by Wood et al. (1985). The washed
filters were then autoradiographed at -70~ Appropriate exposures of the slot blots were analysed by scanning densitometry
using a Schimadzu dual wavelength TLC scanner.

Fig. 3. Chemical cleavage mapping of the probands eDNA. cDNA
encoding the CB9 region was amplified from the proband (P) and
a Gly 883-Asp mutant control (C). These were annealed to labelled
wild type probe and left unmodified (0) or modified with hydroxylamine for 2 h (2). After cleavage, the cDNAs were electrophoresed
in a denaturing polyacrylamide gel together with standard PstIdigested ~. DNA as markers (M). The cleavage products produced

residues (Cotton et al. 1988); these must occur in the
antisense strand of the probe if there is a substitution of
a glycine codon in the target D N A . A positive control
containing a Gly to Asp mutation at amino acid 883
(Tromp et al. 1989b) produced a cleaved band of approximately 287 bp. This agreed well with the expected
size of 294 bp. The proband produced a cleaved product
of 195 bp. If the mismatch in the probe was in the antisense strand, as expected for a substitution of glycine, it
would occur at base 3151 of the complete c D N A sequence of type III collagen given in the E M B L D N A sequence data base (accession n u m b e r X14420; Devereaux
et al. 1984; A l a - K o k k o et al. 1989). If the mismatch was
in the sense strand, it would occur at base 3524.
The c D N A encoding CB9 was resynthesised, amplified
and cloned into M13. Individual subclones were sequenced
and a G to A mutation was found in approximately half
of the clones sequenced; this mutation was located at
base 3143, converting the codon for glycine 847 to that
for glutamic acid (Fig. 4). The position of this mutation
agreed well with the estimated position determined by
chemical cleavage analysis. No other base mutations

containing amplified DNA from the probands family and controls
(C1-C3) were Southern blotted and hybridised to oligonucleotides
(B) encoding Gly 847 (ASOG) or Glu 847 (ASOA)
were found that occurred in m o r e than a single clone.
These were deemed to be artefacts created by the P e R .
To confirm that the Gly 847 to Glu mutation was not
an artefact introduced during reverse transcription or
amplification, genomic D N A from the proband and his
family was analysed by allele specific oligonucleotide
(ASO) hybridisation. Using blood lymphocytes as a
source of D N A , a region of COL3A1 containing the
mutation was amplified, and duplicate aliquots were
Southern blotted. These were hybridised to oligonucleotides specific for the normal or mutant allele (Fig. 5).
The wild type A S O hybridised to all the D N A samples,
whereas the mutant A S O hybridised only to the 3 affected individuals and the probands grandmother (I-2),
who was clinically unaffected and aged 77 years. This is
the first glycine to glutamic acid mutation described in
any of the collagen genes, but the substitution of a helical glycine residue is typical of disease-causing mutations
in collagen genes. We therefore suspected that I - 2 was
mosaic for the Gly 847 to Glu substitution. Mosaicism
for a point mutation in the gene for ~l(I) collagen
(COL1A1), which converts Gly 883 to Asp, has been
shown to be present in a clinically normal parent of siblings who were affected with lethal O I (Cohn et al.
1990). Moreover, a Gly 550 to Arg mutation in COL1A1

Fig.6. ASO slot-blot hybridisation. Six identical aliquots of
amplified DNA from each family member were slot-blotted onto
nitrocellulose. Samples 1-3 were hybridisedto an oligonucleotide
coding for Gly 847, and samples 4-6 to one coding for Glu 847.
Two separate blood samples from I-2 were used for amplification
(a and b). Three separate amplifications were performed using
DNA from the second blood sample (b, c and d). Five single hair
follicles (e-/) were also used as a source of DNA from I-2. Control
DNA was amplifiedfrom three blood samples (cl-c3) and three
hair follicles (c4-c6)
has been demonstrated in the father of a boy with
perinatal lethal OI (Wallis et al. 1990). In this case, the
parent was mosaic and had a milder form of the disease.
To investigate further the hypothesis that I-2 was
mosaic, a second blood sample and several hair follicles
were obtained from this individual. DNA from these
samples was amplified and slot-blotted 6-fold for analysis by ASO hybridisation (Fig. 6). In each case, three
aliquots were hybridised to the normal sequence and
three to the mutant sequence. The mutant ASO hybridised to three separately amplified DNAs from the second blood sample, and also to DNA amplified from five
single hair follicles obtained from I-2. This confirmed
the result obtained with DNA isolated from the original
blood sample and established that it had not arisen because of contamination with mutant DNA.
The ratio of mutant : normal sequence for each affected family member was determined by scanning densitometry. The total area under the three peaks obtained by
scanning the triplicate signals from each ASO hybridisation of the slot blots was compared. All but one DNA
sample (a hair follicle) amplified from I-2 had a mutant :
normal ratio less than those observed for the affected
family members. The DNA from blood had a mean ratio

of 0.55, similar to that obtained from hair follicle DNA,
which was 0.53. This confirms that the proband's grandmother is mosaic for the mutation. The ratios obtained
from hair follicles varied more than those from the blood
samples (data not shown). This was probably caused by
the varying cellular origins of each follicle, which develop from focal crowding of basal cell nuclei in fetal epidermis (Breathnach and Smith 1968). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that cells from I-2 that were
not an integral part of each follicle contributed to the
DNA used for amplifcation.
A mean ratio of mutant:normal DNA of 0.5 indicates that approximately two thirds of the individual's
cells contain the mutant sequence. Since the haematopoetic, epidermal and germinal cell lineages differentiate early in the development of the human fetus, the
mutation must also have arisen at an early stage to be
present in all of these tissues. The mosaicism of this
mutation within I-2 explains why no clinical signs of the
disease are expressed. Unfortunately, no other tissues
were available from I-2 and thus we cannot estimate the
true extent of mosaicism within this individual, in particular whether fibroblasts express the mutant product.
The substitution of a helical glycine in the affected
individuals is typical of disease-causing mutations in
types I, II and III collagen. In type I collagen, the substitution of glycine can produce on OI phenotype varying from mild to lethal, depending upon the nature of
the substituting amino acid and its position within the
helix (Byers 1990). Mutations at the carboxy-terminal
end of the helix tend to be more severe than those at
the amino-terminal end. The substitution of glycine by
aspartic acid at any position so far described, in either
the al(I) or ct2(I) chains, produces lethal OI. Since
glutamic acid is similar in size and charge to aspartic
acid, it too might be expected to produce a severe phenotype, when substituting for a glycine in type I collagen.
However, the effect of a glycine substitution in type III
collagen by glutamic acid on the phenotype of EDS IV is
more difficult to predict, since very few glycine substitutions have been characterised in this molecule. Interestingly, the substitution of Gly 883 in type III collagen by
aspartic acid produces mild EDS IV with only minor
cutaneous thinning (Tromp et al. 1989b), although substitution of Gly 790 in type III collagen, amino-terminal
to Gly 883, causes a more severe form of EDS IV (Tromp
et al. 1989a). Clearly, as yet too few mutations in type III
collagen have been characterised to draw any firm conclusion about the correlation between the nature or position of the substituting amino acid and the severity of the
disease. The family described here had very variable
clinical features including spontaneous carotid-cavernous sinus aneurysm in the proband, tall stature in his
brother, and short stature and an EDS IV facies in the
affected mother. Her bowel fragility was a late and unpredictable complication, although patients with Gly 790
to Ser (Tromp et al. 1989a; Kontusaari et al. 1990) and
Gly 910 to Val (Richards et al. 1991) substitutions, in
type III collagen, have also suffered ruptured bowels.
In summary, we have confirmed that a substitution of
glycine by glutamic acid within the type III collagen helix
