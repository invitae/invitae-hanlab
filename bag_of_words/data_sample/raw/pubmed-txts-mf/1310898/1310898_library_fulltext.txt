Summary
Paramyotonia
congenita (PMC), a dominant disorder
featuring cold-induced
myotonia (muscle stiffness), has
recently been genetically
linked to a candidate gene,
the skeletal muscle sodium channel gene SCN4A. We
have now established that SCN4A is the disease gene
in PMC by identifying two different single-base coding
sequence alterations in PMC families. Both mutations
affect highly conserved residues in the III-IV cytoplasmic
loop, a portion of the sodium channel thought to pivot in
response to membrane depolarization,
thereby blocking
and inactivating the channel. Abnormal function of this
cytoplasmic loop therefore appears to produce the Na+
current abnormality
and the unique temperature-sensitive clinical phenotype in this disorder.

sensitive Na+ gating can be achieved in vitro by expressing
only the a subunit (Nodaet al., 1986a; Goldin et al., 1986;
Suzuki et al., 1988; Auld et al., 1988). To date, distinct a
subunits have been identified for four brain sodium channels, along with separate skeletal and cardiac mUSCle SOdium channels (Noda et al., 1986b; Kayano et al., 1988;
Auld et al., 1988; Rogartet al., 1989; Trimmer et al., 1989;
Kallen et al., 1990). All share a common structure of fOUr
similar domains, each consisting of six membrane-spanning
regions (Figure 1). The four domains, which are thought to
surround the channel pore, are connected by intracellular
loops of varying sizes.
Genetic linkage studies implicate SCN4A, the locus encoding the human skeletal muscle sodium channel a subunit, as the site of the primary defect in both paramyotonia
congenita (PMC) (lod score i = 35.36 at r?l= 0.0) and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) (i = 33.58 at 6 = O.O), two
autosomal dominant disorders characterized by episodes
of abnormal muscle membrane excitability (Fontaine et
al., 1990; Koch et al., 1991 a, 1991 b; PtaEek et al., 1991 a,
1991 b; McClatchey et al., 1992). Clinically, the two disorders are distinct (Engel, 1986). PMC involves a mutation
that leads to cold-induced myotonia (stiffness due to muscle membrane hyperexcitability).
By contrast, HPP involves periodic attacks of muscle paralysis associated with
elevated serum K’. In both disorders, electrophysiological
studies have revealed an abnormal, tetrodotoxin-blockable Na’ current in diseased muscle. In HPP, depolarization of the muscle membrane appears to result from incomplete channel inactivation in the presence of high K+
(Lehmann-Horn
et al., 1987a, 1991; Cannon et al., 1991).
By contrast, in PMC an increased Na+ flux is produced
by cooling the muscle below 27% (Lehmann-Horn
et al.,
1987b).
The fact that at least two different neuromuscular disorders may involve molecular defects in SCN4A presents a
unique opportunity to correlate a disturbance in channel
function with a structural change in a specific domain of
the sodium channel protein. Mutations in transmembrane
segments have been described recently in HPP (PtaEek
et al., 1991~; Rojas et al., 1991) but no SCN4A mutations
have been reported in PMC. Here, we identify two PMC
mutations which, unlike the HPP lesions, implicate improper function of the III-IV cytoplasmic loop of the sodium
channel in this cold-sensitive disorder. To our knowledge,
this is the first delineation of a precise molecular defect for
a temperature-sensitive
human disorder.

Introduction
Results
Voltage-gated sodium channelson the surface of excitable
cells are responsible for the initiation and propagation of
action potentials (Barchi, 1988; Catterall, 1988). Consequently, there has been considerable interest in delineating their molecular structure and functional domains.
Mammalian sodium channels consist of a large a subunit
and one or two smaller 8 subunits. However, voltage-

We have previously used haplotype analysis with (dGdA),
and (dGdT), repeat polymorphisms at the SCN4A locus to
forecast that both disorders display allelic heterogeneity,
with at least two independent mutations predicted to have
occurred in each (McClatchey et al., 1992). We have also

in both activation and inactivation

III-IV loop and the HPP mutations

discerned most of the genomic structure of SCN4A to facilitate the search for mutations (A. I. M. et al., unpublished
data). Using genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to
amplify SCN4A exons followed by direct sequence analysis of the uncloned amplified product, we scanned for mutations in lymphoblast DNAfrom members of two independent PMC families.
We first identified a base pair change that cosegregated
with the disorder in a PMC family of Belgian origin (Figure
2). The mutation, a G-T transversion (Figure 3), produces
a Gly-Val
change in the highly conserved intracellular
loop connecting domains Ill and IV (Figure 1) of the sodium
channel. The affected Gly is one of a pair of glycines that
is present at this position in all known sodium channels.
For affected individual II-2 of the Belgian pedigree, no
other deviation in comparison with several normal individuals was found when the 80% of the sodium channel coding sequence for which the intron-exon structure has been
determined
was scanned, including the regions surrounding both reported HPP mutations. The same mutation was subsequently detected in the only two available
affected individuals in an independent
North American
pedigree, ascertained by myotonia in a distribution of muscles characteristic of PMC. Both pedigrees possessed the
same SCN4A
haplotype on the disease chromosome,

et al., 1992), we scanned 22 nondisease GAl/GTG chromosomes by PCR amplification of genomic DNA followed
by direct sequencing. None displayed the candidate mutation. In addition, some affected individuals from the Belgian and North American families were homozygous for
the GAlIGT6 haplotype but were heterozygous for the
G-T transversion. Overall, the mutation was absent from
79 control chromosomes representing the ten known dinucleotide repeat haplotypes for SCN4A, and from an addi-

In a larger North American PMC family, the disorder cosegregates (lod score i = 2.71 at I?I= 0.0) with a different
SCN4A haplotype, GA4/GT8. The six affected members
of this family did not possess the G-T transversion, but
did reveal a discrete change in the same region of the III-IV
cytoplasmic loop. A C-T transition (Figure 4) altered a

Discussion
Several lines of evidence have indicated that the III-IV intracellular loop is crucial for normal sodium channel function.
An analogous cytoplasmic structure in potassium channels
appears to act as a “ball and chain” to block the channel
pore (Hoshi et al., 1990). Antibodies to the III-IV intracellular
domain of the sodium channel slow inactivation in both rat
muscle cells and rat brain neurons (Vassilev et al., 1988,

change cosegregated with PMC in all members of the pedigree and was absent from 52 control chromosomes. The
GA41GT8 haplotype is extremely rare in the normal population (<lo/o) and was unrepresented
among our control
chromosomes
(McClatchey et al., 1992). Therefore, the
unlikely possibility that this could represent a very rare
polymorphism strictly associated with the GA4/GT8 haplotype cannot be formally excluded.

1989). When sodium channels are expressed in Xenopus
oocytes, deletion or cleavage of the III-IV loop slows inactivation (Stuhmer et al., 1989). Moreover, activation of protein
kinase C in sodium channel-expressing
Chinese hamster
ovary (CHO) cells causes a slowing of inactivation associated with the phosphorylation of a specific Ser residue in the
III-IV loop (West et al., 1991). Recent studies focusing on the
Ill-IV loop of the sodium channel and the analogous amino
terminus of the K’ channel suggest a structural interaction
between inactivating domains and parts of the channel involved in activation (Moorman et al., 1990; Bezanilla et al.,
1991). In particular, exchanging a basic Arg residue for an
acidic Glu residue in the rat brain Ill sodium channel Ill-IV
loop affected both activation and inactivation of the channel
(Moorman et al., 1990). Thus, this highly conserved structure
appears to play a major role in all aspects of channel gating.
The Gly-Val alteration and, most likely, the Thr-Met
substitution that we report here in the cytoplasmic III-IV
loop are associated with a temperature-sensitive
clinical
phenotype. The Gly affected is one of a pair of glycines
present at this position in all sodium channels sequenced
to date, including species as widely separated as man and
Drosophila (Figure 4). The extraordinary
conservation of
this Gly-Gly pair implies that it is of critical functional importance, probably conferring flexibility to this domain of the
sodium channel protein. We suggest that the substitution
of the more rigid Val for Gly stiffens this normally flexible
domain of the molecule, restricting its movement in response to changes in transmembrane
potential (Schulz
and Schirmer, 1979). At normal temperatures, this mutation has minimal clinical significance. However, even a
minor drop in temperature may impede movement of the
loop sufficiently to allow an abnormal Na+ flux.
The Thr residue affected in the other PMC family is also
remarkably conserved (Figure 4), though the effect of substituting the nonpolar Met for the polar Thr is less predictable. We have recently identified additional PMC families
associated with neither the GAlIGT6 nor the GA4/GT8
haplotype, suggesting that additional PMC mutations exist
(A. I. M. et al., unpublished data). We anticipate that these
will reside either in the III-IV cytoplasmic loop region or in
a functionally similar or interacting domain.
The discovery of mutations in SCN4A associated with
PMC establishes this locus as the disease gene, as predicted from linkage studies. In view of the report of two
different SCN4A mutations in HPP (PtBcek et al., 1991c;
Rojas et al., 1991), our data also demonstrate that altering
different domains of the sodium channel protein can produce distinctly different phenotypes. The HPP mutations,
a Thr-Met
change in S5 of domain II and a Met+Val
change in S6 of domain IV, both affect transmembrane
regions far from the Ill-IV cytoplasmic loop implicated in
PMC. The SCN4A locus has also been proposed as a candidate gene in certain other neuromuscular
disorders, including forms of myotonia congenita and the SchwarzJampel syndrome (Lehmann-Horn
et al., 1990; laizzo et
al., 1991). Thus, PMC may be one of an emerging group
of distinct neuromuscular disorders arising from mutations
in functionally disparate regions of this sodium channel.
Their clinical manifestations
demonstrate the extent to

which environmental
variables (e.g., temperature, extracellular K’) may modulate expression of a genetic defect
(Engel, 1986). These intriguing neuromuscular
disorders
may be viewed as natural experiments providing clues
to the relationship between the structure of this sodium
channel and its function at the molecular, tissue, and organismal levels.
Experimental Procedures
PMC Families

Diagnosis of PMC was based on standard criteria (Engel, 1986). The
proband in the Belgian family (III-1 in Figure 2) manifests disabling
muscle stiffness when exposed to cold, but has no history of any paralytic attacks (Van den Bergh et al. 1991). Neurologic
signs include
myotoniaof
the eye, tongue, and arm muscles. Changes in compound
muscle action potential characteristic
of PMC were measured
after
muscle cooling. The North American family with the Gly-Val
change
comprises two affected siblings of German ancestry with severe myotonia (without dystrophy)
predominantly
affecting eyelid, finger, and toe
muscles,
a pattern characteristic
of PMC. These patients describe
chronic stiffness of affected muscles but have not noted aggravation
of the myotonia by cold. Detailed physiological
testing of cold sensitivity has not been possible for these individuals.
The other PMC family,
a North American pedigree of English ancestry,
has six affected members who all suffer from cold-induced
myotonia. For all families, affected and unaffected
members donated blood samples, which were
used for both direct DNA preparation
(Seizinger et al., 1986; Raskind
et al., 1991) and for initiation of permanent
lymphoblastoid
cell lines
(Anderson and Gusella, 1984) as a permanent source of DNA (Gusella
et al., 1979).
PCR and Sequencing
of SCN4A Mutations
Detection of both mutations was accomplished
by first PCR amplifying
the exon shown m Figure 4 and then directly sequencfng
the uncloned
amplification
product. Approximately
100-200 ng of genomic DNA was
amplified by PCR (40 cycles of 1 min at 94%; 2 min at 62%; 3 mm
at 72OC) in a 50 ~1 reaction using Boehringer-Mannheim
PCR buffer
plus 400 PM deoxynucleoside
triphosphate,
2.5 U of Taq polymerase
(Boehringer-Mannheim),
and 50-75 ng of each of the following primers: primer 1, 5’-GGCTGCCTTAAAGGTGAGG-3’;
primer 2, 5’GGTGGAAGGCAGGAAACC-3’.
The product is 283 bp in size and contains
the exon with flanking intron on both sides (A. I. M. et al., unpublished
data). The PCA product was purified using Centricon
30 (Amicon),
and approximately
one-fifth of the product was heat denatured
and
sequenced
using a Sequenase
kit (USE) and the protocol recommended by the supplier, with an internal primer, 5’.AATTGGCTTCTGAGGCTTCT-3’
to read the antisense direction and Y-GAGGTGGGGGTGGTCCTGGA3’
to read the sense direction (Sanger et al.,
1977). Other exons were scanned for mutation by a stmilar method
(A. I. M. et al., unpublished
data).
