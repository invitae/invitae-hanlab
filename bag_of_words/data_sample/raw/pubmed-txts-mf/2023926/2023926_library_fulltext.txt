and B patients

Although the A and B subtypes of NiemanaABSTRACT
Pick disease (NPD) both result from the deficient activity of ad
sphingomyelinase (ASM; sphingomyelin cholinephosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.12) and the lysosomal aumaon of sphingomyelin, they have remarkably distinct phenotypes. Type A disease s a fatal neurodegenerative disorder of infancy, whereas tpe
B disease has no neurologic miestations and is characterized
primarily by reticuloendothelial involvement and survival into
adulthood. Both disorders are more frequent among individuals
of Ashkenai Jewis ancestry than in the general population. The
recent isolation and characterization of cDNA and genomic
sequences encoding ASM has facilitated investigation of the
molecular lesions causing the NPD subtypes. Total RNA was
reverse-trnscribed, and the ASM cDNA from an Ashkenaz
by the
Jewish type A patient was specifically
chain reaction (PCR). Molecular analysis of the PCR products
revealed a G-* T transversionofnucieotide 1487, which occurred
at a CpG dinuceotide and predicted an Arg - Leu substitution
in residue 496. Hybridization of PCR-amplified genomic DNA
with allele-specific oligonucleotides indicated that the proband
was homoallelic for the Arg -* Leu substitution and that both
parents and several other relatives were heterozygous. This
mutation was detected in 32% (10 of 31) of the Ashkenazi Jewish
NPD type A alleles studied and occurred in only 5.6% (2 of 36) of
ASM alleles from non-Jewish type A patients. Of interest, the Arg
-- Leu substitution occurred in one of the ASM alleles from the
two Ashkenazi Jewish NPD type B patients studied and in none
of the ASM alleles of 15 non-Jewish type B patients. In contrast,
the mutation was not present in 180 ASM alleles from normal
individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. These findings identify
mutation among NPD patients of Ashkenai
a frequent m
Jewish ancestry that results in neuronopathic type A disease when
homoallelic and can result in the nonneuronopathi type B
phenotype when heteroallelic. The identification of this ASM
mutation in Ashkenazi Jewish patients should facilitate the prevention of NPD in this population by carrier detection with
molecular diagnostic techniques.

sence of neurologic manifestations, and survival into adulthood. The nature of the biochemical and molecular defects
that underlie the remarkable clinical heterogeneity in the A
and B subtypes remains unknown. Although patients with
both subtypes have residual ASM activity (~1 to 10% of
normal), biochemical analyses cannot reliably distinguish the
two phenotypes. Moreover, the clinical course of type B
NPD is highly variable, and it is not presently possible to
correlate disease severity with the level of residual ASM
activity.
Types A and B NPD occur at least 10 times more frequently
among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry than in the
general population. It is estimated that the incidence of the
type A disease among Ashkenazi Jews is -1 in 40,000, a gene
frequency (q) of =1 in 200, and a heterozygote frequency
(2pq) of -1 in 100 (5). The incidence of type B NPD in the
Ashkenazi Jewish population is less frequent, perhaps 1 in
80,000 (5). Thus, the combined heterozygote frequency for
types A and B NPD has been estimated to be 1 in 70 among
individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish decent. Although the enzymatic diagnosis of affected patients with either type A or B
NPD can be made reliably (4), the enzymatic detection of
obligate heterozygotes has proven problematic, particularly
using peripheral leukocytes as the enzyme source. Presumably, the occurrence of neutral sphingomyelinases in some
sources and/or the presence of residual ASM activity resulting from the mutant allele have contributed to the inability to
reliably discriminate carriers for either disease subtype. Even
the use of cultured skin fibroblasts, which do not express the
neutral sphingomyelinase, has not provided unambiguous
results with obligate heterozygotes (D. A. Wenger, personal

communication).
Recently, two partial cDNAs encoding human ASM were
isolated and sequenced (6). The type 1 cDNA contained an
in-frame 172 base pairs (bp) encoding 57 amino acids; in the
type 2 cDNA this sequence was replaced by an in-frame 40
bp encoding 13 different amino acids. Of the 92 positive
clones identified by cDNA library screening, the type 1 and
2 cDNAs represented "90 and 10%o, respectively (6). Subsequent isolation and expression of the full-length type 1 and
2 cDNAs demonstrated that only the type 1 transcript was
functional (28). The 2347-bp full-length type 1 cDNA had an
87-bp 5' untranslated region, an 1890-bp open reading frame
encoding 629 amino acids, and a 370-bp 3' untranslated
sequence. Analysis of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)amplified 1665-bp region of genomic DNA revealed that the
type 1 and 2 ASM cDNAs resulted from alternative splicing

Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) are autosomal
recessive disorders resulting from the deficient activity of the
lysosomal hydrolase, acid sphingomyelinase (ASM; sphingomyelin cholinephosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.12) and the
accumulation of sphingomyelin, primarily in reticuloendothelial cell lysosomes (1-4). Type A disease is a rapidly
progressive neurodegenerative disease of infancy manifested
by failure to thrive, severe psychomotor retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, and demise by 2-3 years of age. In comparison, type B disease is characterized primarily by reticuloendothelial system sphingomyelin deposition leading to
hepatosplenomegaly and pulmonary involvement, the ab-

of a single ASM transcript (28). Moreover, the localization of
a single ASM-encoding gene (designated SMPDI) to the
region 11p15.1-pl5.4 by somatic cell and in situ hybridization
techniques, supports the occurrence of a single ASM locus
(7). In this communication, we identify a mutation in NPD,
a G T transversion in nucleotide (nt) 1487 that predicts an
Arg Leu substitution at position 496 of the ASM polypeptide (R4%L). Notably, this missense mutation was frequently
found in type A and B NPD patients of Ashkenazi Jewish
ancestry.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines. Primary cultures of fibroblasts and lymphoblasts were established from skin biopsies, and peripheral
blood samples were obtained from NPD patients and family
members and from normal individuals; informed consent was
obtained. NPD cell lines GM00112A, GM00165, GM00370,
GM00406, GM00559, GM02895, and GM03252 were obtained
from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences
Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). Cell
lines 444X.F01, 534R.F03, 556X.F01, 888V.F01, 2789X.F01,
4293Q.E02, 4774Z.F01, 5113C.L01, 5115E.FO1, and
6791M.F01 were obtained from the Service de Biochimie,
Hospice de Lyon (Lyon, France). Cell lines DMN 83.126,
DMN 83.133, DMN 84.135, DMN 86.40, DMN 86.49, DMN
87.71, DMN 87.99, DMN 88.9, GJO, and RNS were provided
by Peter Penchev (Developmental and Metabolic Neurology
Branch, National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke). The cells were grown in RPMI
1640 medium/10% fetal bovine serum/1% penicillin/
streptomycin at 1 mg/ml by standard procedures (8). The
diagnosis of types A and B NPD was based on clinical criteria
(e.g., age at onset, presence of neurologic involvement, etc.)
and by demonstration of markedly deficient ASM activity in
cultured cells (9).
Enzyme and Protein Assays. ASM activity was determined
in cultured fibroblasts obtained from NPD patients and
normal individuals using the fluorescent natural substrate,
[N-12(1-pyrenesulfonyl)amido dodecanoyl] sphingomyelin
as described (9). One unit of activity equals that amount of
enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 nmol of substrate per hr. Protein
was determined by a modified fluorescamine assay (10).
cDNA and Genomic Amplification and Sequencing of the
Mutant Allele. Total RNA and genomic DNA were isolated
from cultured skin fibroblasts by standard procedures (11).
First-strand cDNA was reverse-transcribed from -5 ,g of
total RNA by using a cDNA synthesis kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). The
cDNA (410% of the total reaction) or genomic DNA (-0.5
Ag) was amplified by PCR with Thermus aquaticus (Taq)
polymerase (Cetus), essentially as described by Saiki et al.
(12) with the following conditions and modifications. PCR
was performed for 30 to 40 cycles and consisted of denaturation for 1 min at 94°C and annealing and extension for 4 min
at 660C or 720C. To improve the specificity of the PCR
amplification for the cDNA, a "PCR boost" procedure was
used. In this procedure the concentrations of the primers and
Taq polymerase were 0.1 ,uM and 5 units/ml, respectively,
for the first 15 cycles. Then each primer was added to a final
concentration of 0.5 AM, and an additional 2 units of Taq
polymerase was added to the reaction mixture. PCR amplification then proceeded for an additional 15-25 cycles.
Pairs of sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers were
synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 380B DNA
synthesizer (13) and used to specifically amplify (i) the entire
coding region of the reverse-transcribed type 1 ASM transcript in three overlapping cDNA fragments, (ii) the 1665-bp
genomic region containing the alternatively spliced sequences in the type 1 and 2 ASM cDNAs (28), and (iii) a

genomic region that included the point mutation for confirmation of the candidate missense mutation. To amplify a
984-bp fragment from the 5' end of the ASM cDNA, the 29-mer
sense primer, P1 (5'-AGTAGTCTCGAGACGGGACAGACGAACCA-3'), corresponded to ASM, nt -39 to -23 with an
additional 12 nt that included an Xho I restriction site and the
31-mer antisense primer, P2 (5'-AGTAGTCTGCAGAGCAGGGTACATGGCACTG-3'), corresponded to ASM nt 926
to 945 with an additional 12 nt containing an EcoRI restriction
site. To amplify an internal 383-bp fragment of the ASM cDNA,
the 29-mer sense primer, P3 (5'-ATCATCAAGCTTGGGTAACCATGAAAGCA-3'), corresponded to ASM nt 947-964
with an additional 12 nt containing a HindIII restriction site, and
the antisense 32-mer primer, P4 (5'-ATCATCGAATTCTACAATTCGGTAATAATTCC-3'), corresponded to ASM nt
1310 to 1330 with an additional 12 nt containing an EcoRI
restriction site. To amplify a 789-bp 3' fragment from the ASM
cDNA, a 19-mer sense primer, P5 (5'-CTCCACGGATCCCGCAGGA-3'), corresponded to ASM nt 1185 to 1203 and contained an internal BamHI restriction site, and an antisense
32-mer primer, P6 (5'-AGTAGTGTCGACTTGCCTGGTTGAACCACAGC), corresponded to ASM nt 1955 to 1974 with
an additional 12 nt containing a Sal I restriction site. Primers P3
and P4 also were used to amplify the 1665-bp internal genomic
region that contains the alternatively spliced type 1 and 2 cDNA
sequences. To confirm the candidate mutation by genomic
sequencing and dot-blot analysis (see below), a 27-mer sense
primer, P7 (5'-AGTAGTCGACATGGGCAGGATGTGTGG3'), was used with antisense primer P6 to amplify a 567-bp
genomic fragment containing the G -+ T transversion.
After PCR amplification, the products were isolated from
agarose gels and subcloned into either Bluescript KS (+)
(Stratagene) or pGEM 7Zf (-) (Promega) vectors. For each
amplified product, from four to six independent subclones
were sequenced in both orientations by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method (14).
Dot-Blot Analysis. Any nucleotide change that occurred in
more than two subcloned PCR products was considered a
candidate mutation and analyzed by dot-blot hybridization
with allele-specific oligonucleotides. In addition, allelespecific oligonucleotides were constructed and used as
probes to analyze amplified genomic DNA from normal
individuals and NPD patients and family members. From
these studies genomic DNA was rapidly isolated from either
whole blood or cultured cells by the following procedure.
About 0.5 ml of whole blood and 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM
Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.5/5 mM MgCl2/0.32 M sucrose/1%
Triton X-100) were mixed at room temperature. After centrifugation at 13,000 x g, the supernatant was removed, and
0.5 ml of PCR buffer (10 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 8.3/50 mM
KCI/2.5 mM MgCl2/gelatin at 0.1 mg/ml/0.45% NonidetP40/0.45% Tween 20/proteinase K at 0.1 mg/ml) was added.
For cultured cells, the lysis step was omitted, and the washed
cell pellets were resuspended directly in PCR buffer (-5 x
106 cells per ml). The samples were then incubated at 60°C for
1 hr and boiled for 10 min to inactivate the protease; then 25
,ul was removed for PCR amplification. After agarose gel
electrophoresis of the PCR products, the concentration of
each product was estimated by ethidium bromide staining.
For each sample -0.5 ,ug of DNA was used for the dot-blot
analysis.
For the analysis of the R4%L mutation, the 567-bp PCR
product amplified from genomic DNA was analyzed by
dot-blot hybridization (11) by using Zetabind nylon membranes (AMF Cuno) and a Bio-Rad dot-blot apparatus. Hybridizations were performed for at least 3 hr at 39°C. After
hybridization, the blots were washed at room temperature for
15 min in 6x SSC (1x SSC is 0.15 M sodium chloride/0.015
M sodium citrate, pH 7.0)/0.1% SDS and then for 2 hr in the
same solution at either 53TC for the normal (5'-CTATTTG-

RESULTS
Identification of the R496L Mutation in an Ashkenazi Jewish
Type A NPD Patient. To determine the molecular lesions in an
Ashkenazi Jewish type A NPD patient (proband 1), who had
'1% of normal ASM activity in cultured fibroblasts, total
RNA was isolated from cultured lymphoblasts and reversetranscribed into cDNA; then the entire coding region was
PCR amplified. Nucleotide sequencing of the subcloned PCR
products revealed a single point mutation in a CpG dinucleotide,

To confirm the authenticity of this candidate mutation, a
567-bp region of genomic DNA from the proband, various
family members, and 90 normal Ashkenazi Jewish individuals
was PCR amplified and then hybridized with normal and
R496L-specific radiolabeled oligonucleotides. As shown in

the transversion and indicating that proband 1 was homoallelic for the R496L mutation. Of the nine other family
members studied, both parents, the paternal grandfather, and
a paternal aunt were heterozygous for the R496L mutation.
The maternal grandmother did not have the mutation, suggesting that the maternal grandfather was heterozygous for
this mutation. There was no known consanguinity between
the maternal or paternal grandfathers whose ancestors were
from different European countries. Moreover, the R496L
mutation was not found in 180 ASM alleles studied from a

Occurrence of R496L in Ashkenazi Jewish and Non-Jewish
NPD Type A Families. The occurrence of R496L in other NPD
families was determined by dot-blot analysis of genomic
DNA from 17 unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish and 18 unrelated
non-Jewish type A NPD families. As indicated in Table 1, of
the 31 Ashkenazi Jewish NPD alleles studied (i.e., from 6
unrelated patients and 19 unrelated obligate heterozygotes),
32% had the R496L mutation. Only proband 1 was homoallelic for the mutation, whereas three obligate heterozygotes
from unrelated families in which material from patients was
unavailable were heteroallelic for the R496L mutation. In
contrast, only 2 of 36 (5;6%) alleles had the R496L mutation
in non-Jewish NPD type A patients. An American of German
ancestry was homoallelic for the R496L mutation.

Occurrence of the R496L Mutation in Ashkenazi Jewish and
Non-Jewish NPD Type B Families. Analysis of genomic DNA
from two unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish NPD type B patients
revealed the presence of one R496L allele in one patient
(designated proband 2). In contrast, the R4%L allele was not
found in genomic DNAs from 15 non-Jewish NPD type B
patients (Table 1).

DISCUSSION
Insights into the molecular nature of the remarkably distinct
type A and B NPD phenotypes have been gained by the
identification of a mutation in the ASM gene causing this
lysosomal storage disease. The G -* T transversion of coding
nt 1487 occurred at a CpG dinucleotide, a known hotspot for
point mutations (15) and predicted the R496L change in the
ASM polypeptide. Homoallelism for the R496L mutation
resulted in the severe neuronopathic type A phenotype, as
evidenced by proband 1, who had =1% or normal ASM
activity. It is not known whether the substitution of the basic
arginine for the more hydrophobic and neutral leucine residue
altered the enzyme polypeptide catalytic activity, stability, or
both, because monospecific anti-human ASM antibodies
useful for immunoblotting are not currently available.
Of the 17 unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish type A families
studied, 9 were either homoallelic or heteroallelic for this
lesion. In this sample, the frequency of the R496L allele was
32%, indicating that this lesion is an important mutation in
type A NPD among Ashkenazi Jewish patients. It is likely
that there is another more frequent mutation or, perhaps,
multiple mutations, causing type A NPD in Ashkenazi Jewish
patients. In contrast, analysis of 18 unrelated non-Jewish
type A patients revealed the presence of the R496L allele in
only 1 (a frequency of 5.6%). The presence of the R4%L
allele in this individual may have resulted from an independent mutational event or the occurrence of Jewish ancestors
in this family.
One of the two Ashkenazi Jewish type B NPD patients
studied was heteroallelic for the R4%L mutation. The other
allele in this Jewish type B patient had a different ASM
mutation, which presumably resulted in the synthesis of a
partially functional ASM polypeptide, as this patient had
-5% residual ASM activity in cultured fibroblasts. The fact
that none of the 15 non-Jewish type B patients had the R496L
allele suggests that this allele is extremely rare in type B
disease outside of the Ashkenazi population. That the R496L
mutation was not a common polymorphism in the Ashkenazi
Jewish population was supported by the fact that it was not
present in 180 ASM alleles analyzed from normal Ashkenazi
Jewish individuals.
For the past three decades, the genetic mechanisms responsible for the high frequency of the mutations that cause
Tay-Sachs disease, Gaucher disease, and NPD in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (gene frequencies of -0.02, 0.02,
and 0.005, respectively) have been the subject of interest and

debate (16-20). Intrigued by the fact that all three of these
disorders are lysosomal diseases resulting from enzymatic
defects in the sphingolipid degradative pathway, investigators suggested that there may have been a common selective
pressure for their high gene frequencies in the Ashkenazi
Jewish population (20). Others argued that the higher gene
frequencies in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals could be due to
higher mutation rates for these genes (16) or founder effect
and genetic drift (19). The recent identification of the mutations causing these three diseases in the Ashkenazi Jewish
population has provided insight into this controversy. To
date, three mutations in the 13-hexosaminidase a chain (localized to chromosomal region 15q23-24) have been identified as the cause of Tay-Sachs disease in almost all Ashkenazi Jewish patients. Two of these mutations result in the
infantile form, a 4-bp insertion (21) or a splice-site mutation
(22), which account for -80 and 20% of the mutant alleles,
respectively. Affected Ashkenazi Jewish patients with the
less frequent and milder chronic or adult-onset form all have
been heteroallelic for a point mutation Gly -* Ser at position
269 (23) and one of the two infantile-onset alleles. Type 1
Gaucher disease among Ashkenazi Jewish patients results
from multiple mutations in the acid 83-glucosidase gene (localized to chromosomal region 1q21-q31), the Asn -* Ser (at
position 370) allele occurring in -75% of the mutant alleles,
whereas the other 25% include several other lesions (24).
With the identification of the R4%L mutation causing NPD,
it appears that in the Ashkenazi Jewish population each of
these sphingolipidoses results from a common mutation (i.e.,
-70%o or more of the mutant alleles) and at least one or more
less frequent mutations in their respective genes. The fact
that two or more mutant alleles in each gene occur frequently
in this population argues for selection, rather than for a higher
mutation rate or founder effect and genetic drift, as the major
mechanism responsible for their increased frequency. Although it is likely that the major mutation for each disease
first became established in the Ashkenazi Jewish population
by founder effect and genetic drift, the finding of two or more
mutations in each of these genes supports a selective advantage. Because all three disorders involve defects in lysosomal
enzymes that degrade sphingolipids, it is tempting to suggest
that a common selective agent, such as resistance to an
adverse situation (e.g., an infectious disease), could have
increased the heterozygote frequency by differential survival
(thus, increased fitness) for individuals heterozygous for each
of these disorders. Alternatively, heterozygosity for these
mutations may have been selected for by unrelated pressures
in the past. Although several hypotheses have been advanced
(20, 25), the nature of the selective advantages for these
mutations remains unknown.
The identification of the R4%L allele and other mutations in.
the ASM gene in types A and B NPD may provide information
for genotype-phenotype correlations and permit more accurate
genetic counseling for newly diagnosed cases in families without a previously affected individual. Identification of other
mutations, particularly those with residual activity that cause
type B disease, also may provide structure-function information and may facilitate delineation of the active-site region.
Previously, the enzymatic detection of heterozygotes for NPD
types A and B was not sufficiently reliable to permit mass
voluntary screening in the Ashkenazi Jewish community. Thus,
the identification of the R496L and other mutations in types A
and B NPD will permit accurate heterozygote identification in
families with these lesions as well as heterozygote screening and
prevention of NPD in the general Ashkenazi Jewish population,
as has been the prototypic experience with Tay-Sachs disease
(26). Using molecular techniques, we and others (ref. 27; H.
Yoo, personal communication) have already demonstrated the
feasibility of molecular heterozygote screening for Tay-Sachs
disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The extension of

3752

such molecular screening to include the more common mutations causing Gaucher disease and NPD by the use of multiplex
PCR should permit the simultaneous screening and prevention
of all three sphingolipidoses in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.
