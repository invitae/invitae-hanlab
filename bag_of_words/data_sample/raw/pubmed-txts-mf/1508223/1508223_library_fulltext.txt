Androgen-dependent gene transcription is mediated
by the androgen receptor (AR) through interaction
of its central zinc finger region with specific DNA
sequences on target genes. Failure of this receptormediated gene transcription results in end organ
resistance to androgens-the androgen insensitivity
syndromes. In a pair of siblings with complete androgen insensitivity who had supranormal levels of
androgen binding in genital skin fibroblasts, polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis of
the androgen receptor gene confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of AR
cDNA, revealed an in-frame deletion of exon C encoding the second zinc finger of the receptor. The
mutant receptor in cultured genital skin fibroblasts
had normal androgen binding affinity and was local- ·
ized in the nucleus but had markedly reduced DNAbinding affinity. When recreated in vitro and tested
in a cotransfection assay system the mutant receptor failed to activate transcription of an androgenresponsive reporter gene. This naturally occurring
mutation highlights the functional dependence of the
AR upon its second zinc finger in vivo and explains
the complete insensitivity to androgen manifest by
the affected individuals despite increased androgen

genital skin fibroblasts further suggests a possible
role for the second zinc finger in autoregulation of
receptor levels in vivo. (Molecular Endocrinology 6:

INTRODUCTION

Human male sexual differentiation and development are
critically dependent upon androgen-driven activation of
maleness-determining genes of unknown identity. Failure of normal embryonic induction of such genes in
karyotypically 46,XY individuals can result either from
inadequate androgen levels or from inadequate response to normal androgen levels and leads to defective fetal masculinization. The major cause of impaired
response to androgen is defects of the androgen receptor (AR)-the androgen insensitivity syndromes (AIS).
This heterogeneous group of receptor abnormalities
produces varying degrees of AR dysfunction accompanied by a constellation of phenotypic abnormalities
ranging from mild hypospadias through significant genital ambiguity to complete failure of masculinization
i resulting in a female external phenotype.
Quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of androgen binding in genital skin fibroblasts have implicated

1103

the AR in the pathogenesis of AIS for many years (13). AIS has traditionally been classified as receptornegative or receptor-positive depending upon the absence or presence of specific high affinity androgen
binding in cultured genital skin fibroblasts (4-7). Up to
35% of individuals with complete AIS have normal
androgen binding capacity in genital skin fibroblasts (48) often associated with qualitative binding abnormalities such as reduced affinity (5, 7), rapid ligand dissociation (7, 9), thermolability (7, 9, 10), and altered binding specificity (7).
The AR is comprised of distinct functional domains
(11) encoded by an X-chromosomal gene containing
eight exons [ designated A-H (12) or 1-8 (13)): the most
5' exon (exon A or 1) encodes the N-terminal transcription-regulating domain of the receptor (14); exons B
and C (2 and 3) encode the central DNA-binding zinc
finger domain (12); exon D (or 4) encodes the hinge
region that contains a signal for nuclear translocation
of the receptor (14); the 3' portion of exon D and exons
E-H (5 to 8) encode the androgen binding domain (12).
Examination of the AR gene in AIS-affected subjects
has revealed that underlying the wide.. spectrum of
androgen-binding abnormalities is an equal diversity of
molecwlar defects in exons encoding the androgenbinding domain (12, 15-22). The majority are single
base pair mutations that alter an amino acid (12, 1619), introduce a premature termination codon (20, 21 ),
or cause aberrant mRNA splicing (22).
In a small number of cases of AIS (4, 6) androgen
binding in cultured genital skin fibroblasts is apparently
qualitatively as well as quantitatively normal, indicating
an abnormality in some facet of AR target gene activation distal to androgen binding. The lack of androgen
binding abnormality in these cases prompted their designation as postreceptor defects (9, 23); however, the
discovery of point mutations in exons B and C (24-26),
encoding the receptor zinc fingers, indicates that this
form of AIS can result from abnormalities in the DNA
binding domain. To further examine the basis for androgen resistance in the presence of normal androgen
binding, we studied a pair of siblings with complete AIS
who had supranormal levels of high affinity androgen
binding in cultured genital skin fibroblasts (27). Analysis
of the AR gene defect in these subjects provides an
explanation for the functional failure of the AR in the
presence of elevated androgen binding; it highlights the
importance of the second zinc finger of the AR in
mediating receptor-DNA-binding, and thus androgendependent transcriptional activation in vivo, and suggests a possible role for the second zinc finger in
autoregulation of receptor levels.

. (see Materials and Methods). Thus we postulated an
abnormality outside the receptor androgen-binding domain. Analysis of genomic DNA of the two affected
siblings revealed a deletion of exon C of the AR gene,
encoding the second zinc finger of the receptor DNAbinding domain. This exon failed to amplify from genomic DNA of the subjects after 30 cycles of polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers
flanking exon C (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-4). Relatives and
unrelated control individuals demonstrated the expected PCR product of 413 base pairs (bp). Amplification of exons A, B, and D-H resulted in the expected
sized products in the two AIS subjects and in relatives

Southern blots of BamHl-digested genomic DNA hybridized with a 32 P-labeled probe encompassing exon
C showed a band at about 4.4 kilobases (kb) in digests
of genomic DNA from relatives and controls. This band
was absent from digests of DNA from the two affected
children (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2). Similarly, the expected
9.4-kb band produced by hybridization of fcoRl-digested genomic DNA with the exon C probe was absent
from the genomic digests of both affected children (data
not shown). When blots were rehybridized with a factor
IX cDNA probe (28), all subjects displayed the expected
bands at 25 kb on BamHI digestion and 12.5 kb on
fcoRI digestion, indicating equivalence of DNA digestion, loading, and transfer (not shown).
Complementary DNA produced by reverse transcription of poly(Aj+ RNA obtained from genital skin fibroblasts of one of the affected siblings and an unrelated
control was amplified by PCR using primers with sequence from exons B and E (Fig. 2). Amplification of
control cDNA resulted in a PCR product of the predicted
size of about 660 bp. In contrast, a product of about
540 bp resulted from amplification of the subject's
cDNA. The size difference between control and subject
PCR product reflected the absence of the 117-bp exon
C (Fig. 2). The same size difference between subject
and control PCR product was seen when cDNA was ·
amplified with primers from exons A and G (not shown).
Dideoxy sequencing of the subject's amplified cDNA
demonstrated direct continuity of sequence from exon
B to exon D, indicating that correct splicing had occurred between these exons with no disturbance of the
translational reading frame.
The Zinc Finger-Deficient Receptor Localizes in the

Transcriptionally Inactive

Deletion of the second zinc finger of the AR predicts a
number of possible consequences for receptor function.
Subcellular localization of receptor could potentially be
disturbed either by the structural alteration of the receptor or by a change in its DNA-binding characteristics.
However, as demonstrated in Fig. 3, immunoperoxidase staining using the primary immunoglobulin G (lgG)
fraction of antibody AR 32 [directed to the N-terminal
region of the AR (29)], demonstrated predominant nuclear localization of AR in both control (30) and subject

Second, it was expected that deletion of the second
zinc finger would disrupt receptor-DNA binding and

equivalent levels of receptor expression, indicating that
the failure of AR-mediated trans-activation was not a
function of reduced expression of the mutant AR compared with the normal AR (data not shown).

DISCUSSION

Because hormone-binding is the primary event in ARmediated target gene activation, it is not surprising that
abnormalities of AR androgen binding result in defective
target gene expression. In keeping with the high frequency of androgen-binding abnormalities in AIS, the
great majority of cases in which a molecular defect has
been determined are associated with abnormalities in
exons encoding the androgen-binding domain of the
receptor (12, 15-22). Definition of the molecular defect
in cases of AIS in which all characteristics of androgen
binding are normal has been more elusive. This report
illustrates such an abnormality-a defect outside the
hormone-binding domain that functionally incapacitates
the receptor.
The affected siblings described in this report displayed complete androgen resistance despite supranormal concentrations of qualitatively normal androgen
binding (27) and normal nuclear localization of the AR
in genital skin fibroblasts. Examination of the AR gene
and cDNA revealed a deletion of exon C, resulting in
splicing of exon B to exon D, without disturbance of
the translational reading frame. The deletion of exon C
predicts a receptor protein that lacks 39 amino acids
encompassing the second zinc finger, but retains the
hinge region and androgen-binding domain; the retention of these regions explains the normal nuclear localization and high affinity androgen binding of this receptor. This mutant receptor is, however, defective in target
gene activation, evidenced in vivo by the complete
absence of response to androgen-the total failure of
masculinization of the karyotypically 46,XY affected
siblings-and in vitro by the failure of the recreated zinc
finger-deficient AR to activate transcription of an androgen-responsive reporter gene in cotransfection assays.
The loss of trans-activating ability of this naturally occurring mutant receptor probably results from severe
impairment of receptor interaction with HRE nucleotide
sequences at target genes, as evidenced by the decreased affinity of the mutant AR extracted from genital
skin fibroblasts for the HAE-containing MMTV-LTR sequence.
This study highlights the importance of the second
zinc finger of the AR in target gene activation in vivo
1 and provides some insight into other functional roles of
this region of the receptor. Although no similar natural
deletion has previously been reported, single amino acid
alterations in the zinc fingers of the AR (24-26) and of
the vitamin D receptor (38, 39) have been described in
association with hormone resistance in vivo and diminished transcriptional activation when recreated in vitro.
Transcriptional activation by the AR and many other

1107

steroid receptors follows a series of coordinated events.
Hormone binding, receptor activation, and nuclear
trans.location are followed by interaction of the hormone-receptor complex, apparently as a dimer, with
specific enhancer-like nucleotide sequences-HREsin the vicinity of target genes to modulate activity of
target gene promoters (40).
Both zinc fingers of the DNA-binding domain are
absolutely required for transcriptional regulation in vitro
(41, 42). Mutagenesis (41-44) and crystallographic (45)
studies of other steroid receptors have revealed that
the two zinc fingers are structurally and functionally
distinct subdomains. The first finger is responsible for
recognition of the specific target DNA sequence (4244). The second finger orients the receptor for DNA
binding (43), stabilizes DNA-protein interaction (42, 43),
contains a site directly involved in transcription activation (46), and provides the dimerization interface (45).
Dimerization and DNA binding appear to be intimately
related processes. Crystallographic analysis of the
DNA-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)
has revealed that DNA binding induces dimerization,
placing the dimer subunits in adjacent major grooves
on the DNA (45). Other studies in GR, however, have
shown that dimerization of receptor is the primary
event, essential for specific high affinity receptor-DNA
binding (47), and that the GR exists as a dimer even in
the absence of DNA (48). The progesterone (49) and
estrogen receptors (50) have also been shown to interact with their HREs as dimers, and the AR presumably
functions similarly. Although one study (51) has defined
a region within the steroid-binding domain as critical for
dimerization, the major determinant of dimerization is
probably the second zinc finger (47). Thus it is likely
that the second zinc finger-deficient AR described in
this report is incapable of dimerization and thus of
forming the stable high affinity interactions with target
DNA necessary for transcriptional activation; the absence of high affinity DNA binding demonstrated in this
mutant receptor is consistent with this speculation.
In contrast to its critical role in the DNA binding
essential for transcriptional activation, the second zinc
finger does not appear to be required for nuclear localization of the receptor; fibroblasts from these AISaffected siblings showed normal nuclear retention of
3
[ H]DHT (27) and normal nuclear localization of the AR
in immunocytochemical studies. Although a hormonedependent nuclear localization signal has been described within the second zinc finger of the progesterone receptor (52), our data from this mutant AR indicate
that neither nuclear transport nor nuclear retention of
AR are qualitatively dependent upon sequences within
or functions of the second zinc finger. This is consistent
with in vitro data indicating that a major nuclear localization signal in the AR resides in the hinge region
downstream of the second zinc finger (14) and parallels
t.he observation in the progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor (52, 53) that the hinge-region signal plays
the dominant role in mediating, receptor nuclear transport.

An intriguing feature of this mutant AR is its supranormal concentration in cultured genital skin fibroblasts
of the affected siblings (27). One possible explanation
for this finding is failure of autologous down-regulation,
a normal feature of AR (54, 55) and other steroid
receptors (56-59) .. Receptor down-regulation is thought
to be mediated by a decrease in the rate of transcription
or the half-life of receptor mRNA (55, 57, 59). The
mechanism involved is unknown, however it may be
analogous to receptor-mediated inhibition of target
gene transcription. This has been shown to be a function of the DNA-binding domain in the GR (46, 60) with
which the AR shares high sequence homology. The
testicular feminized (Tfm) rat, an animal model of androgen insensitivity in which a single amino acid alteration
in the androgen-binding domain severely disturbs AR
function (61), does not show the normal androgendependent down-regulation of AR mRNA seen in the
wild type (54). Similarly, although we have not quantified
AR mRNA in this study, the elevated receptor levels
found in our subjects' genital skin fibroblasts could
perhaps reflect an inability of the zinc finger-deficient
receptor to mediate down-regulation of AR mRNA.
No other natural intragenic exon deletion has been
described in the AR gene or other steroid receptor
genes; however, this type of mutation is common in the
huge X-chromosomal gene encoding the structural
muscle protein, dystrophin. Deletions that disturb the
translational reading frame of this gene produce the
severe Duchenne form of muscular dystrophy, while inframe deletions that presumably result in semifunctional
internally deleted proteins cause the milder Becker form
(62). Analysis of deletions in the dystrophin gene has
revealed that the disruption or maintenance of the
reading frame by an intragenic exon deletion depends
upon the nature of the exon-intron borders of the exons
flanking the deletion: only deletions that juxtapose two
exons with borders at the same position in the triplet
will maintain the reading frame. In the AR gene only
exons C and D are flanked by exons with borders
which, when spliced, produce a complete triplet (i.e. B/
Dor C/E). Consequently, deletion of exons other than
these will produce a frameshift mutation and thus a
severely truncated protein. In the dystrophin gene the
deletion breakpoints have been shown to cluster within
the larger intrans of the gene (63). Analogous to this,
the potential for deletion of exons C or D of the AR
gene may be increased by the fact that both are flanked
by the largest intrans in the gene, approximately 1015 kb each (13; Lubahn, D. B., and J. A. Simental,
unpublished observations). Because of this large size
of the intrans flanking exon C, we have not attempted
to map the deletion breakpoints.
With the definition of the molecular basis of many AR
defects, the traditional receptor-positive vs. receptor-·
negative terminology has become inaccurate. The term
receptor-negative, which has been liberally applied to
AIS cases characterized by absence of androgen binding, now accurately applies only to instances in which
no AR protein is produced-complete deletion of the

Vol 6 No. 7

AR gene (64, 65), or other defects such as premature
termination codons (13, 20, 21) or aberrant splicing (22)
. that may disrupt mRNA stability and thus receptor
protein production. The term postreceptor defect is
equally unenlightening. Mutations within the DNA binding domain such as described here and elsewhere (2426), although having no effect on androgen binding,
nonetheless produce a severely dysfunctional receptor.
Another class of mutations as yet undefined could
include abnormality of the promoter region of a critical
AR target gene or dysfunction of some other factor
specifically required for efficient target gene transcription by the AR. These, if discovered, would represent
the true postreceptor defects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects

The clinical details of the affected children and their unaffected
relatives have been previously described (27). The index subject is a phenotypic female with 46,XY karyotype. She presented at 10 days of age with bilateral inguinal herniae, each
of which contained a testis. There was no clitoromegaly or
other clinical evidence of androgen effect. One of three older
sisters was subsequently found to also have a 46,XY karyotype. She entered puberty at 12.8 yr and progressed to full
feminization but developed no pubic hair. The testes were
removed at the completion of puberty. The younger child is
currently prepubertal at 12 yr of age. Both children underwent
genital skin biopsy for androgen binding studies on cultured
fibroblasts.
Previous analysis demonstrated a 2.5-fold elevation of total
cellular AR concentration in genital skin fibroblasts of these
children compared with controls. The [3 H]DHT binding affinity,
thermostability, and dissociation rate of the DHT-receptor
complex were normal, and the proportion of whole cell [ 3 H]
DHT binding located in the nuclear fraction was 60% both for
the subjects' cells and a normal fibroblast strain (27).
Methods
Polymerase Chain Reaction Approximately 0.5-1.0 µg genomic DNA extracted from leukocytes of subjects, female relatives, and unrelated controls by standard methods were used
in each 50- or 100-µI PCR reaction. Twelve sets of oligonucleotide primers 23-29 bp in length were used in PCR to amplify
the eight exons of the AR gene as previously described (12,
66). Products of the PCR (285-455 bp in length) were examined by ethidium bromide staining after electrophoresis in 1 .21.4% (wt/vol) agarose gels.
The exon C-specific probe for Southern analysis was prepared by PCR of exon C using control genomic DNA as
template. The product, purified by electroelution from an agarose gel slice, was 32 P-labeled using a random prime kit
(Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN).

Genomic DNA (10 µg) of subjects,
female relatives, and controls was digested separately with
restriction endonucleases EcoRI and BamHI (BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) for 16 h under reaction conditions specified by the
manufacturers. DNA was separated on 1% (wt/vol) agarose
gels and transferred to GeneScreen Plus (NEN, Boston, MA)
in 0.4 M NaOH buffer. Prehybridization, hybridization, and
washing of the membranes were as previously described (15).
The 32 P-la~eled probe was used at 106 cpm/ml solution in
hybridizations. Membranes were exposed to Kodak XAR-5
film (East/nan Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) with intensifying
Southern Blot Analysis

screens at - 70 C for up to 10 days. To control for equivalence
of DNA digestion, loading, and transfer, the blots were washed
free of probe according to the manufacturer's specifications
and rehybridized with a 32 P-labeled Xbal fragment encompassing exon 1 of the factor IX gene (28).
Analysis of cDNA Genital skin fibroblasts obtained at biopsy
were grown to confluence in Medium 199 (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, 'MD) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin,
2.0 mM L-glutamine, and 20 mM HEPES. For total RNA extraction, cells were harvested in guanidine thiocyanate (67) and
centrifuged through a cesium chloride gradient. Polyadenylated RNA was isolated by chromatography with oligo(dT)
cellulose (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) (68). cDNA
was produced by reverse transcription from 5 µg poly(Aj+ RNA
using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Life
Sciences, St. Petersburg, FL). PCR was performed on 50 ng
subject and control cDNA [obtained from a control fibroblast
cell strain (16)] using primers designed from sequences in
exons B and E (nucleotides 1991-2028 and 2628-2653,
respectively) or exons A and G (nucleotides 1844-1869 and
2847-2870, respectively) (numeration according to Ref. 12).
The PCR products were electrophoresed through 1 .2% agarose and examined for the 117-bp size difference corresponding to exon C. The amplified cDNA from the latter PCR was
subsequently purified, cloned into pGEM -3Zf(+) (Promega,
Madison, WI), and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination
method (69) using the exon A and G primers detailed above
and Sequenase DNA polymerase (United States Biochemical,
Cleveland, OH).
Site-Directed Mutagenesis To examine the functional char,
acteristics of the zinc finger-deficient receptor, the mutation
was recreated by site-directed mutagenesis using a modification (14) of the PCR technique described by Higuchi (35). The
AR expression vector pCMVhAR (34) containing the full-length
human AR cDNA cloned into the eukaryotic vector pCMV5
(37) was used as the starting DNA in these experiments. A
pair of complementary mutagenic oligonucleotide primers was
designed comprising the last 20 bp of 3' -exon B sequence in
continuity with the initial 18 bp 5' -exon D sequence, and
containing none of the intervening exon C sequence. Two
separate primary PCR reactions were performed, each using
one of the mutagenic primers and an appropriate upstream or
downstream primer with sequence from exon A or H (the
external primers). The products of the primary PCR were
purified, combined, denatured, and annealed and used as
template in the secondary PCR using the two external primers.
This produced the large amplified product with the intended
deletion. This final PCR product and the starting vector,
pCMVhAR, were digested with Hindlll (BRL) and Csp45 I
(Promega) and the mutant cDNA fragment cloned back into
the starting vector to create the exon C-deleted mutant AR
vector, pCMVhARdelC, for subsequent use in functional studies. The PCR-generated region of this construct-bounded by
the 5' Hindlll (exon B) and 3' Csp45 I (exon G) cloning siteswas sequenced to exclude PCR errors.
Transient DNA Transfections and Transcription Activation
by ARs To examine transcriptional activating ability of the
mutant AR, 10-cm dishes containing 1.3 x 106 monkey kidney
CV1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD)
were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Essential Medium-High
Glucose (DMEM-H; GIBCO BRL) supplemented as above
except that fetal calf serum was at 5%. Cells were transfected
' with 1 µg of either the normal AR expression vector,
pCMVhAR, or the exon C deletion mutant AR vector,
pCMVhARdelC, using the calcium phosphate precipitation
method (61 ). The reporter plasmid pC29GtkCAT (10 µg) (36),
containing two glucocorticoid response elements separated
by 29 bp positioned 5' of the thymidine kinase promoter and
the CAT gene (70), was cotransfected. Cells were incubated
for 48 h in medium containing 0.2% serum with or without 50
nM R1881, harvested, and assayed as previously described

1109

(34) for activity of the CAT enzyme by reaction with o-threo[1,2-14C]chloramphenicol (ICN Biornedicals, Costa Mesa, CA).
The reaction products were separated by TLC and autoradiographs examined for the presence of the faster migrating
acetylated products of chloramphenicol. To quantitate the
stimulation of CAT activity, regions of the TLC plates containing the acetylated and nonacetylated chloramphenicol were
cut out and counted in scintillation liquid (Scintiverse BO, Fisher
Scientific, Raleigh, NC) in a liquid scintillation counter. The
percent acetylated [ 14 C]chloramphenicol was calculated as
(cpm acetylated + cpm total) x 100, for each reaction. The
percent acetylated [ 14 C]chloramphenicol in the absence of
R1881 was defined as baseline for each vector tested. Fold
induction of CAT activity was calculated as percent acetylated
in the presence of R1881 + baseline, for each vector. The
results are given as mean + so for three independent experiments, using three separate clones of the pCMVhARdelC
construct.
lmmunoblots and Androgen Binding of Expressed AR For
analysis of mutant AR protein expression and androgen binding, COS 7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were
plated in 10-cm dishes at 1.2 x 106 cells per dish or in 48-well
culture plates plated at 50,000 cells per well, respectively, and
grown in DMEM-H with 5% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and
15 mM HEPES (pH 7 .2). After 24 h, the cells were transfected
with 10 µg/dish or 0.5 µg/well normal (pCMVhAR) or mutant
(pCMVhARdelC) AR expression vector using the diethylaminoethyl-dextran method (71 ). Whole cell androgen binding assays
over the range 0.05-5.0 nM R1881 and immunoblots using
antibody AR 52, an antibody to the N-terminal region of AR,
were performed as previously described (34, 61).
lmmunocytochemical Localization of the AR Cultured genital skin fibroblasts from one of the affected siblings and a
normal foreskin fibroblast cell strain (30) were plated into twochamber glass slides in standard supplemented medium as
above. After 48 h the medium was changed to serum-free,
phenol red-free DMEM-H, with or without the addition of 50
nM R1881. Cells were grown for up to a further 24 h, washed
in PBS, and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 10% sucrose, and
0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. They were treated with 2
µg/ml of the primary lgG fraction of AR 32 (29) and stained by
the avidin biotin peroxidase complex method as previously
described (29, 72). To control for specificity of the antibody
reaction, duplicate wells were incubated with preimmune lgG
or with antibody preadsorbed with the free peptide antigen.
Partition Sedimentation Analysis of AR Binding to
DNA The interaction of androgen-AR complexes with the
MMTV-LTR sequence was assayed using a zonal sedimentation velocity technique (31-33). Crude nuclear preparations of
subject and control genital skin fibroblasts were extracted with
20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 600 mM
KCI, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 nM [3 H]DHT,
centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 C and desalted
using a Sephadex G25 column. [ 3 H]DHT-AR complexes were
prepared by incubation of crude nuclear extracts of subject
and control cultured genital skin fibroblasts with [ 3 H]DHT
followed by elution from a DHT-17-hemisuccinate affinity matrix (as described in Ref. 31). Plasmid pMSG-CAT (Pharmacia,
Knowlhill, Great Britain) that contains androgen response element sequences within the MMTV-LTR sequence was linearized by digestion with Pvul and incubated (approximately 2
nM) with [3 H]DHT-receptor complexes (0-20 nM) in reaction
mixtures containing 1 mM NaxP0 4, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA and
50 mM NaCl. After 60 min incubation on ice, 140-µI aliquots
were layered over 5-20% (wt/vol) linear sucrose gradients (5
ml) in buffer as above and centrifuged in a Sorvall TV865
vertical rotor (Dupont UK Ltd., Hertfordshire, UK; r.v = 7.83
cm) for 35 min at 65,000 rpm (370,000 x Gav), Since [3 H]DHTAR-DNA complexes sediment to the bottom of the gradient at
high concentrations of normal AR (20 nM), gradients were
fractionated from the bottom, and DNA-bound AR was concentrated in fractions 2-7. AR~DNA binding data were plotted

according to Scatchard and the binding affinities obtained by
vectoral analysis of Scatchard plots using the method of
Rosenthal (73).
