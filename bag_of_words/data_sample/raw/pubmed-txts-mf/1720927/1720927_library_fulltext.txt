Summary
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is an X-linked neurologic disorder characterized by dysmyelination in
the central nervous system. Proteolipid protein (PLP), a major structural protein of myelin, is coded on the
X chromosome. It has been postulated that a defect in the PLP gene is responsible for PMD. Different
single-nucleotide substitutions have been found in conserved regions of the PLP gene of four unrelated PMD
patients. Novel Southern blot patterns suggested a complex rearrangement in a fifth family. Linkage to PLP
has been shown in others. We evaluated the PLP locus in a four-generation family with two living males
affected with X-linked PMD. Analysis of DNA from the affected males revealed complete absence of a band,
with PLP probes encompassing the promoter region, the entire coding region, and the 3' untranslated region
and spanning at least 29 kb of genomic DNA. DNA from unaffected relatives gave the expected band pattern.
Two obligate and one probable carrier women were hemizygous for the PLP locus by dosage analysis.
Although it is unlikely, the previously described point mutations in PLP could represent polymorphisms. The
finding of complete deletion of the PLP gene in our family is a stronger argument that mutations in PLP
are responsible for X-linked PMD.
Introduction

Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is an early-onset
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal myelination in the central nervous system and by
severe spasticity, ataxia, and psychomotor retardation
(Tyler 1958; Rapin 1989). The classic form of the
disease is X linked, but genetic heterogeneity is likely.
Diseases similar to PMD have been described in animal models including the shaking pup and the jimpy
mouse. Mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions or altered splice junctions in the murine proteolipid protein (PLP) confer the jimpy phenotype.
(Hudson et al. 1987; Macklin et al. 1987; Nave et al.
1987; Ikenaka et al. 1988; Gencic and Hudson 1990).
PLP is produced by oligodendrocytes and forms a subReceived June 6, 1991; revision received July 22, 1991.

stantial part of the myelin sheaths that wrap large
axons in the central nervous system (Braun 1984).
PLP is also synthesized by peripheral nervous system
Schwann cells (Puckett et al. 1987). The human PLP
gene maps to Xq2l.3-q22 (Mandel et al. 1989) and
spans approximately 17 kb in genomic DNA (Diehl
et al. 1986), and the corresponding cDNA has been
cloned and sequenced (Puckett et al. 1987). Abnormalities at the PLP locus have been described in at least
five families with PMD (Fahim and Riordan 1986;
Gencic et al. 1989; Hudson et al. 1989; Trofatter et
al. 1989; Pratt et al. 1991), and genetic linkage to PLP
has been shown in others (Maenpaa et al. 1990). We
evaluated the PLP locus in a family with two living
males affected with an X-linked neurologic disorder
consistent with PMD.

coagulated blood, establishment of B-lymphoblastoid
cell lines, DNA extraction, and Southern blot analyses
of restriction-fragment alleles have been described
elsewhere (Raskind et al. 1991). Probes used to delineate the deletion were pXG-12, p19-2, S21, and the
following four probes for the X-linked proteolipid
protein: pLP1.5, pLP1.3, pJB010, and pJC102 (fig.
1). Probes pLP1.5 and pLP1.3 are, respectively, 1.5kb and 1.3-kb EcoRI cDNA fragments of the PLP
locus that are subcloned into pUC8 (Puckett et al.
1987). Probe pLP1.5 contains exons 1-6 and a portion of exon 7; pLP1.3 contains the noncoding region
of exon 7. Probe pJBO10 is a 4.2-kb SalI-BamHI genomic fragment that contains the promotor and upstream regulatory elements of PLP and extends into
the first exon. Probe pJC102is an 11-kb BamHI genomic fragment that extends 6 kb downstream of the
terminal exon. The genomic inserts were cut from
plasmid pTZ19R prior to use. Probe pXG-12 was also
used to estimate dosage. Probes were obtained from
Kay Davies, Kenneth Fischbeck, Lou Kunkel, Carmie
Puckett, and the American Type Culture Collection.
Densitometry and calculation of the area under the
curve was performed with a GS-300 scanning densitometer and GS-370 Data System software (Hoefer
Scientific Instruments, San Francisco).

The proband (III-5) is presently 35 years old and
confined to a wheelchair. He was the product of fullterm delivery by Cesarean section without complication. His immediate postnatal health was within the
range of normal. However, motor milestones were
markedly delayed. He was noted to have signs of spasticity at age 1 year, and by age 2 years he could ambulate slowly with the use of a walker. At age 4 years
he could understand and follow many commands but
was dysarthric and only able to speak a few simple
words. He was incontinent of bowel and bladder. He
was able to reach and grasp objects with both hands
and to perform simple tasks of dexterity. Mild bilateral optic atrophy was noted with "apparently good
vision clinically." A clinical psychologist concluded
that there was some impairment of intellect, but the
degree of mental retardation was difficult to determine, because of speech and motor deficits. He had
a prominent rigid spastic paraplegia and underwent
bilateral tendon releases at the ankles and knees.
When examined at age 32 years he was alert and cooperative, with severe dysarthria and scanning speech.
He could follow simple commands and attempted to
utter phrases, but only his mother could recognize
their meaning. There was occasional gross pendular
horizontal nystagmus on lateral gaze to either side.
Optic disks were pale. There were poorly coordinated
dystonic movements of both arms, with contractures
of the elbows. There was marked spasticity in both
lower extremities, with bilateral ankle clonus, bilateral grasping responses of the toes, and a right Bakinski reflex. Pin prick and pain were felt in all four limbs;
sensory exam was otherwise unreliable. There was a
1 + jaw jerk and a positive snout reflex. The patient

Deletion of PLP Gene in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease
was unable to walk. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) brain scan was unreadable because of severe
movement artifact.
The proband's older half-brother (III-2) had a similar neurologic history. He was the product of forceps
delivery at 8 mo, because of breech presentation. He
suffered a seizure in the postnatal period. He was able
to roll over and sit at age 1 year, stood at 14 mo,
but never gained bowel or bladder control. When first
examined at 17 mo he was found to have internal
strabismus and spasticity of all four extremities and to
be capable of producing only gurgling noises. Although at age 21/2 years he could speak a few words
and at age 5-6 years could walk with assistance, these
capabilities were subsequently lost. At age 15 years he
was alert, with little purposeful movement, which was
limited to his arms, eyes, and head. He could answer
questions by moving his eyebrows and by minimal
lateral shaking of his head. His neck and fingers were
hyperextended, and there were flexion contractures at
the elbows, wrists, hips, and knees. Tendon reflexes
were all hyperactive, with bilateral ankle clonus and
Babinski responses. The impression was that the subject had cerebral palsy, with severe spastic quadriplegia "but with not too much mental retardation." He
died at age 17 years of aspiration pneumonia and congestive heart failure. At autopsy, gross brain weight
was 1,280 g and, the cerebellum was described as
atrophic. Microscopic examination of the brain reported only mild nonspecific gliosis of the cerebellum
and cerebral hemispheres. No tissue or slides remain
from this autopsy.
The proband's 4-year-old nephew (IV-2) was the
product of a normal gestation and delivery, with a
birth weight of 11 lb 2 oz. He was delayed in achieving
all motor and developmental milestones and was reported to have nystagmus as a baby. Examination at
age 2 years 1 mo revealed that he could not crawl or
walk but could locomote by rolling. Although unable
to talk, he could recognize pictures and television
characters. Examination showed that he was able to
roll from prone to supine but could not sit and had
poor neck and trunk control. He could reach, grasp,
and transfer objects with difficulty. He uttered only
five of six consonants but appeared to understand
speech and commands. He had a spastic diplegia, with
hyperactive tendon reflexes, bilateral extensor plantar
responses, and pallor of the right optic nerve. Head
circumference was 40.75 cm (below the second percentile). MRI brain scan showed bilateral increased
signal intensity in the periventricular white matter. In

1357

view of these findings and family history a diagnosis of
probable Pelizaeus-Merzbacher leukodystrophy was
made.
The proband's half-sister (III-3) died at age 5 mo
with meningomyelocele and hydrocephalus. Another
half-sibling of the proband (III-4) was still born with
multiple congenital anomalies, including esophageal
atresia, agenesis of the left kidney, and hypoplastic,
cystic right kidney. A maternal aunt (II-3) died at 3
mo, with neural tube defects, and a maternal uncle
(II-2) died at 6 years, of meningitis.
The proband's mother (II-1) was examined at age
59 years. Her neurologic examination was remarkable
for hyperactive knee reflexes, restricted upward gaze,
and poorly coordinated smooth-pursuit eye movements. Her MRI brain scan pattern, pattern-reversal
visual evoked responses, and brainstem auditoryevoked responses were normal. Her mother (I-1), the
maternal grandmother of the proband, was examined
at age 79 years. She had experienced slowly progressive memory loss since age 60 years. She was alert and
cooperative but was disoriented with regard to person,
place, and time. Short- and long-term memory were
impaired. She could read, write, and name objects and
had no language difficulty. She had full eye movements, except for poor upward gaze, and there was
no nystagmus. She ambulated slowly with a walker.
Tendon reflexes were normal, and plantar reflexes
were down-going. There was a positive snouting reflex. Sensation was intact with respect to pin-prick,
touch, and position. The clinical diagnosis was probable Alzheimer disease. She died at age 80 years. Gross
brain weight was 1,010 g. No amyloid plaques or
neurofibrillary tangles were identified in the cortex.
The only microscopic abnormality was mild diffuse
gliosis of the white matter. No specific cause for her
dementia could be identified.
Deletion of the PLP Gene

Southern blot analysis of the PLP locus by using
EcoRI, BgllII, MspI, HindIII, or PstI revealed absence
of a signal for pLP1.5 with digests of DNA from
affected males, whereas DNA from unaffected relatives gave the expected band pattern. Results for
EcoRI digestion are shown in figure 3A. Similar results
were obtained for the pLP1.3 probe (results not
shown). The limits of the deletion were investigated
by hybridizing family members' DNA to 32P-labeled
inserts from pJB010 or pJC102, containing genomic
sequences immediately upstream to and downstream
from the PLP coding region (fig. 1). For analysis of

the two obligate carriers, II-1 and 111-6, and the probable carrier, I-1, R values were 0.3, 0.24, and 0.33,
respectively. The carrier R values are all more than 2
SD below the mean of the noncarrier R values. The
sister of an affected boy (IV-1) has a 50% a priori
risk of being a carrier. Her R value is 0.36, strongly
suggesting that she is also a carrier of PMD.

pJB010, DNA was digested with MspI; analysis of
pJC102 was done on EcoRI-digested DNA. These sequences were included in the deletion, which covers a
minimum of 29 kb. PLP maps to Xq2l.3-q22 (Mandel
et al. 1989). No alteration in band pattern was observed either for pXG-12 and S21, mapped to Xq22,
or for p19-2, located in Xq21.3 (Mandel et al. 1989).
Therefore, these loci are outside the deleted area.
Dosage of the PLP Gene
The blot shown in figure 3A was rehybridized with
the X-linked probe pXG-12 to allow densitometric
estimation of dosage by comparison of results obtained with pLP1.5 and pXG-12 (fig. 3B). Both probes
detect a band of approximately 8 kb in EcoRI-digested
DNA. Densitometry was measured along each lane
for each probe. A ratio (R) of the densitometric measurement for pLP1.5 to that for pXG-12 was calculated for each lane. The mean R for seven unrelated
control females was 0.94, with an SD 0.18. For both
the father of one affected boy (III-7) and an unrelated
male, R values were 1.27 and 0.93, respectively. For

PMD is an X-linked recessive disease of central nervous system myelin. Onset is in the first few months
of life, with transient irregular nystagmus and head
tremor (Merzbacher 1910; Rapin 1989). There is severe motor retardation, as well as spasticity, ataxia,
dysarthria, incontinence, limb contractures, and adventitious movements. Mental abilities are difficult to
evaluate, because of the marked motor handicap, but
some degree of mental retardation has been assumed.
Death often occurs in the first 2 decades, but longer
survival is possible. A more severe connatal variant
has been described. Neuropathologic changes are limited to the white matter, which shows a tigroid appearance of patchy islands of preserved myelin on a background of diffuse lack of myelin staining. The clinical
findings, X-linked inheritance pattern, and MRI
changes in the present family are all compatible with
the classic variety of PMD. Unfortunately, postmortem study of the brain of III-2 was not detailed enough
to establish the neuropathologic diagnosis of PMD.
It has been postulated that a defect in the PLP gene
is responsible for X-linked PMD. Different single nucleotide substitutions were found in PLP exons from
four unrelated PMD patients (Gencic et al. 1989;
Hudson et al. 1989; Trofatter et al. 1989; Pratt et al.
1991), and an altered Southern pattern suggesting a
complex rearrangement was obtained with DNA from
another patient with PMD (Fahim and Riordan 1986;
Willard et al. 1987). However, no base changes were
found in sequenced PLP exons from at least 10 unrelated males with PMD (Hudson et al. 1989; Trofatter
et al. 1989; Pratt et al. 1990), and a family with symptoms and neuropathologic findings of "typical" PMD
has been found to have no mutation in the PLP gene
(Hudson et al. 1989). If disruption of the PLP locus
is the cause of PMD in these families, the defect must
involve nonexonic sequences. Alternatively, another
gene(s) is responsible for the disease in these families.
We have evaluated the PLP locus in a four-generation pedigree exhibiting an X-linked disease consistent
with PMD. Southern blot analysis of DNA from two

Deletion of PLP Gene in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease

affected males revealed complete absence of PLPrelated sequences. The limits of the deletion have not
been defined, but it covers a minimum of 29 kb of
genomic DNA. It is possible that one or more genes in
addition to PLP are included in the deletion. However,
the lack of apparent clinical differences between our
cases and previously reported cases of PMD suggests
that the deletion in the family that we studied has
not extended to the genes neighboring PLP. Dosage
analysis suggests that carrier women are hemizygous
for the PLP locus. This is the sixth reported family in
which a defect in PLP segregates in tight linkage with
PMD. Although it is highly unlikely, the previously
described single nucleotide substitutions could represent polymorphisms linked to - but not the cause ofPMD. Complete deletion of the PLP gene in the family
that we studied is stronger evidence that defects in PLP
are responsible for PMD.
If the disease in the family that we studied is entirely
caused by the absence of PLP, the similarity between
the phenotypes that result from a null mutation and
the missence mutations would suggest that the accumulation of abnormal PLP-related proteins in the
point mutants is not the primary cause of the oligodendrocyte cell death observed in animal models (Nave et
al. 1987; Roussel et al. 1987). It is possible that other
protein moieties of myelin accumulate when functional PLP is unavailable. However, it is more likely
that the dysmyelination results from the absence of
normal PLP protein.
A few females with symptoms of X-linked PMD
have been described, including two women in the early
report by Merzbacher (1910). The mother of our proband had mild hyperreflexia and subtle eye-movement
abnormalities. Her mother, also highly likely to be a
carrier of the PMD gene, had unexplained adult-onset
dementia, with only mild diffuse gliosis of white matter at autopsy. These findings could represent expression of the PLP mutation in females, but there is presently no proof of a cause-and-effect relationship in this
family.
The alteration in PLP is unique for each of the PMD
families in which the molecular defect has been described. Therefore, molecular screening of new cases
will entail evaluation of the entire PLP locus; the
method of carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis
would be dependent on the specific mutation found.
Carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis in the family
that we studied would be possible by assessing the
dosage of PLP. It is interesting that the clinical severity
of disease is similar in the families for which the molec-

1359

ular defects in the PLP locus have been characterized,
despite marked differences in these alterations. It has
become apparent that the dysmyelinating diseases are
molecularly heterogeneous. It may now be appropriate to reserve the eponym PMD for the distinct
subset of diseases characterized by mutations of the
PLP gene.
