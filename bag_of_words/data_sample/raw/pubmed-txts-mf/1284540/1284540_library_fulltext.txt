Cystic fibrosis, the most common lethal genetic disease in the white population, is caused by mutations
in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Analysis of DNA from a
pancreatic insuffkient patient by chemical mismatch cleavage and subsequent DNA sequencing led to
the identification of a potential splice mutation in the CFTR gene. A transition of the invariant
guanosine to adenosine (1898 l G > A ) was found at the splice donor site of intron 12. To determine
the effect of this mutation on the patient’s CFTR transcripts, RNA from the nasal epithelium was
reverse transcribed and amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Direct sequencing of
the PCR products revealed that the transcript from the chromosome with the 1898+ 1G>A mutation
had skipped exon 12 entirely, resulting in a joining of exons 11 and 13. Deletion of exon 12 results in
the removal of a highly conserved region which encodes the Walker B consensus sequence of the first
nucleotide-binding fold of CFTR. o 1992 Wiley-Liss, I ~ C .

INTRODUCTION

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal
autosomal recessive disorder in the white population, affecting approximately 1 in 2,500 live births
(Boat et al., 1989). T h e disease is characterized by
abnormalities in electrolyte transport including defective CAMP regulation of chloride channels in
epithelial cells (Quinton, 1990; Welsh, 1990).
The gene implicated in CF, the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
gene, has been cloned (Rommens et al., 1989;
Riordan et al., 1989; Kerem et al., 1989) and the
predicted protein product is similar to the family of
ATP-binding transport proteins (Ames et al.,
1990; Hyde et al., 1990). The structure consists of
a repeated motif of six putative membrane spanning segments followed by a nucleotide binding
fold (NBF) . Separating the two halves of the molecule is a highly charged regulatory (R) domain
with multiple phosphorylation sites (Cheng et al.,
1991).

rects the chloride transport defect (Drumm et al.,
1990; Rich et al., 1990), and expression of CFTR
in a variety of heterologous cells is associated with
the appearance of CAMP-regulated chloride con.
ductance (reviewed by Collins, 1992). Purified
CFTR protein reconstituted in lipid bilayers also
forms chloride channels (Bear et al., 1992). These
data suggest that CFTR itself is able to function as
a CAMP-regulated chloride channel.
The most common mutation responsible for CF
is a deletion of the phenylalanine at position 508
of CFTR (AF508). This mutation accounts for approximately 70% of CF chromosomes worldwide
(Cystic Fibrosis Genetic Analysis Consortium,
1990). In the remaining 30% of CF chromosomes,
over 170 putative mutations have been identified,

splice mutations (Tsui et al., 1992). Identification
and characterization of putative mutations provide
insight into the function of CFTR. We have used
chemical mismatch cleavage and subsequent DNA
sequencing to identify a splice mutation at the 5’
end of the intron following CFTR exon 12. CFTR
mRNA transcribed from this allele was found to
skip exon 12 entirely.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Description

Two unrelated CF patients were identified as
having AF508/1898 1 G > A mutations from
DNA analysis, as discussed below. Both patients
were previously diagnosed as having CF on the
basis of clinical findings of typical pulmonary and
gastrointestinal disease, together with abnormal
values of sweat chlorideisodium test.
Patient “A” was a 39-year-old white male. His
height was 169 cm (10% for age) and weight was
5 1 mg ( < 5% for age). Tests of pulmonary function
revealed FVC of 2.55 L (59% of predicted) and
FEVl of 1.29 L (36%). He was pancreatic insufficient. He had a history of liver disease and required
splenorenal shunt for portal hypertension at age 14
years.
Patient “B)was a 9-year-old white female. Her
height was 124 cm (10-25% for age), and weight
was 26.4 kg (25-50% for age). Tests of pulmonary
function revealed FVC of 1.23 L (93%) and FEVl
of 1.04 L (86%). She was pancreatic insufficient.

Detection of Mutation by Chemical Mismatch
Cleavage and DNA Sequencing

CFTR exon 12, including more than 100 bp of
each flanking intron sequence, was amplified from
patient DNA by standard methods (Sambrook et
al., 1989). The primers and conditions used were
those of Zielinski (1991), except that the primers
were modified by the addition of a BamHI restriction site as follows: 5’-ATACGGATCCGTGAATCGATGTGGTGACCA-3 ’ and 5 ATAC’e

GGATCCCTGGTTTAGCATGAGGCGGT-3’ .

Chemical mismatch cleavage was performed as
described (Strong et al., 1991) based on published
methods (Cotton et at., 1988; Grompe et al.,
1989). Heteroduplexes were formed between patient and radioactively labeled wild-type DNA by
heating the mixture to boiling and slowly cooling
to room temperature. Treatment with hydroxylamine and osmium tetroxide modified mismatched nucleotides in the heteroduplexes, which
were then cleaved with piperidine. The cleavage

381

products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 6%
acrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography.
DNA determined to contain a mutation based
on the chemical mismatch cleavage studies was
amplified by PCR, gel purified, digested with
BamHI, and subcloned into M13mp18 DNA. Single-stranded DNA was isolated and sequenced by
the dideoxy chain termination method using a Sequenase Kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.)
Allele Specific Oligonucleotide Screening
Oligonucleotides were generated corresponding
to the normal (5‘ -TTTGAAAGGTATGTTCT.
3’) and mutant (5’-TTTGAAAGATATGTTCT3‘) sequences. Amplified exon 12 DNA from CF
patients and normal individuals was transferred to
nylon membranes and hybridized to kinased olig.
onucleotides as described (Strong et al., 1991),
except that the hybridization and washes were
done at 39°C.
Analysis of CFTR mRNA from Nasal Epithelium
Nasal tissue was obtained from the patient by
nasal scrape using a Rhino-Probe (Synbiotics
Corp, San Diego, CA). The sample was placed in
phosphate buffered saline and total RNA was isolated by the RNazol B method (Cinna/Biotecs Laboratories, Friendswood, TX) . Approximately 1 p g
of RNA was reverse transcribed using 1 p g of random hexamers as reverse transcription primers in a
50 p,l reaction which contained 500 p M dNTPs,
50 units of RNasin (Promega), 200 units of
MMLV-RT (BRL), and a buffer of 50 mM Tris
(pH 8.3), 50 mM KC1, 8 mM MgCl,, and lOmM
DTT. One-fifth of the reverse transcription reaction was used in a 50 r~.lPCR reaction and the
buffer and dNTPs concentrations were adjusted to
that of a standard PCR reaction (Sambrook et al.,
1989); 250 ng of each primer was included in the
reaction. The 5’ primer (5‘-CACGGATCCAACCACCATCTC ATTCTGCATTGTTCTG-3 ‘)
was located in exon 7, and the 3‘ primer (5’-CACCTGCAGGTTCAGGA G ACAGG AGCATCT)
CCTTCTAATG-3’) was in exon 13. Reaction
conditions were 35 cycles of 1 min at 94°C and 2
min at 72°C; followed by an extension step of 10
min at 72°C. One microliter of this reaction underwent a second round of amplification with a
nested 5’ primer (5’-ATACCTCGAGGACTTCA C T C T A A T G A T G A T T A T G G G - 3 ’) in exon
10 and the same 3’ primer. The product was visualized on a 1% agarose, 1.5% NuSieve gel. Nega.
tive controls included a water control as well as a
control which contained patient RNA but no reverse transcriptase.

followed by an extension step of 10 min at 72°C.
Direct Sequencing of PCR Products

Direct sequencing of PCR products was based
on the method of Kretz et al. (1989) using a
Sequenase Kit. Briefly, PCR products were
visualized on a 1% NuSieve GTG gel by long
wave ultraviolet light and the bands were excised.
The agarose was melted and a 1O-Fi aliquot was
annealed with 50 ng of the 5’ PCR primer, which
acted as a sequencing primer. To each DNA:
primer tube, diluted dGTP labeling mix, DTT,
[35S]dATP,and Sequenase was added according to
manufacturer’s directions. The reaction was held
at 37°C for 4 min, and then 4 pl of the reaction
was added to the dideoxy nucleotides. After
incubation for 5 min, the reaction was stopped by
drying followed by the addition of 6 pl of stop
solution, and the samples were electrophoresed on
a 6% denaturing gel.

DNA Analysis

CFTR exon 12 from a patient heterozygous for
AF508 (patient “A”) was amplified by PCR and
analyzed by chemical mismatch cleavage. A mismatch between the patient’s DNA and normal
DNA was detected by modification with hydroxylamine and subsequent cleavage with piperidine.
The abnormal cleavage product is shown in Figure
1A and indicates the presence of a mutation in the
region of exon 12. The 426-bp fragment including
exon 12 and the flanking intron DNA was subcloned into M13 and 6 independent clones were
sequenced. In three clones, a mutation at the
splice donor site immediately following exon 12
was identified; the G of the splice donor site was
changed to an A (1898 1 G > A ) (Fig. 1B). This
G is part of the highry conserved GT dinucleotide
of splice donor sites. The sequence of the other
three clones was normal for exon 12 and the surrounding intron sequences.
To determine if this potential splice mutation
was found in any additional patients in our population, DNA from our panel of CF patients was
amplified and analyzed by hybridization with an
oligonucleotide specific for the mutation. Of 110
non-AF CF chromosomes screened, one additional
unrelated patient (patient “B”) was identified as
having the mutation. Sequencing of this patient’s

PCR (RT-PCR) using primers in exons 10 and 13.

strated that it represents a transcript that has
skipped exon 12, resulting in the joining of exons
11 and 13 (Fig. 2b). This RT-PCR product
(CFTRAl2) was wild type at F508, indicating the
aberrantly spliced transcript originated from the
chromosome bearing the 1898 1 G > A mutation
(Fig. 2c). The larger RT-PCR product was also
analyzed by direct sequencing (not shown) and predominantly represents the full length message, transcribed from the AF508 chromosome. However,
this product could not be completely purified by
agarose gel electrophoresis and contained a small
amount of the 1898+ 1 G > A product, which was
wild type at F508 and had exons 11 and 13 spliced
together. To confirm that no full length mRNA was
transcribed from the chromosome with the
1898 1 G > A mutation, PCR was performed on
the reverse transcribed RNA using a primer in exon
12. A single band was amplified which originated
solely from the AF508 chromosome when analyzed
by direct sequencing (Fig. 3 ) . A diagram of the
location of the 1 8 9 8 + 1 G > A mutation and its
effect on CFTR RNA splicing is shown in Figure 4.

DISCUSSION

Chemical mismatch cleavage and DNA sequencing of CF patient DNA led to the identification of a potential splicing mutation following
exon 12 (1898 + l G > A ) . This mutation was
found in two of 111 non-AF CF chromosomes in

our generally North American white CF population. The nucleotide altered in this patient is part
of the highly conserved G T dinucleotide found at
the splice donor junction sequence. This guanosine is conserved in more than 99.8% of splice sites
(Senapathy et al., 1990), indicating a crucial role
in mRNA splicing. Mutations in other genes at the
critical + 1 G nucleotide of the splice donor site
have been found to cause disease by at least two
different mechanisms. As in the case of the pglobin gene, mutation at this site may result in the
activation of a cryptic splice donor site (Treisman
et al., 1982). Usually the cryptic splice donor site
is located near the splice donor site. A survey of
the sequence near the 1898 1G > A mutation revealed the presence of one GT dinucleotide within
exon 12 and three within the first 100 bp of the
intron that could potentially act as splice donor
sites. However, PCR amplification of the transcript indicated that none of these sites was utilized
to a detectable degree.
The second, more typical consequence of a 5’
splice mutation is a complete skipping of the exon
preceding the mutation, as is seen in this case.
This mechanism of exon skipping suggests that
both the splice acceptor site immediately preceding an exon and the splice donor site immediately
following the exon must be recognized before that
exon will be spliced into the mature message
(Talerico and Berget, 1990).

STRONG ET AL.

Reverse transcription and PCR analysis revealed
that the effect of the 1898 1 G > A mutation is
skipping of exon 12, with a precise joining of exons
11 and 13. As assessed by direct sequencing, the
full length PCR product originated solely from the
AF508 chromosome and the CFTRA12 product
originated from the 1898 1G > A chromosome.
The approximately equal quantities of the two
messages indicated that the CFTRA12 transcript is
stable. The stability of this message may be due to
the fact that exon 12 consists of 87 bp and its
deletion does not result in a shift of reading frame.
Therefore, stop mutations, which are associated
with unstable transcripts in other CFTR mutants
(Hamosh et al., 1991), have not been introduced
into the coding region.
Translation of the CFTRAl2 message would result in the synthesis of a protein which is missing
29 amino acids in the first nucleotide binding fold
(Fig. 4). This is a highly conserved region in the
family of ATP-binding transport proteins of which
CFTR is a member. The region deleted would include the Walker B consensus sequence (Walker et
al., 1982), a critical region that is thought to interact with the Mg2+ of the MgATP complex (Pai
et al., 1990). The resulting protein would be expected to be defective in the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. As hydrolyzable ATP is necessary for
CFTR to function as a chloride channel
(Anderson et al., 1991), it is unlikely that such a
protein, if stable, would be functional. It is interesting to note that we have observed alternative
splicing of exon 12 in several tissues from normal
individuals (Strong and Collins, in preparation).
The finding of this allele which results in the deletion of exon 12 in the mRNA and is associated
with disease suggests that the CFTRA12 protein, if
produced, is not able to carry out all of the normal
functions of the full length product.
