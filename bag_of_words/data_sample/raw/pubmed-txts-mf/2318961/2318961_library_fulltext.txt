Abstract
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) has a frequency of 0.2% in
most populations of the world. In selected populations such as
the Afrikaners in South Africa, the Christian Lebanese, and
the French Canadians, the disease is more frequent due to the
founder effect. Previous studies demonstrated that a single
mutation at the LDL receptor locus, the so-called French Canadian deletion, makes up 60% of the mutant genes responsible
for FH in the French Canadian population. In this study, efforts were directed to determine if there were other common
LDL receptor mutations in this population. Three missense
mutations were identified and each mutation was reproduced
and expressed in vitro. Two of the three mutations result in the
production of an LDL receptor protein that is not processed to
its mature form at a normal rate. Molecular assays were developed to detect the mutations directly, and the LDL receptor
genes of 130 French Canadian FH heterozygotes were
screened for the presence of the three missense mutations as
well as two deletions. LDL receptor mutations were detected in
76% of individuals and 14% had one of the three missense
mutations. (J. Clin. Invest. 1990. 85:1014-1023.) familial hypercholesterolemia- LDL receptors hypercholesterolemia

Introduction
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)' is an autosomal dominant disorder due to mutations in the LDL receptor gene (1).
FH heterozygotes have a two- to threefold elevation in plasma
LDL associated with tendon xanthomas and accelerated atherosclerosis. FH homozygotes have a markedly elevated level
of plasma LDL and these individuals often develop coronary
atherosclerosis in childhood (1). The LDL receptor gene has
been cloned (2) and numerous mutant alleles from individuals
with FH have been characterized at a molecular level. A vast

array of different mutations in the LDL receptor gene have
been described, including nonsense mutations, missense mutations, deletions, and insertions (3). The mutations have been
classified into four groups based on the characteristics of the
LDL receptor protein produced (4). In normal fibroblasts, an
LDL receptor precursor protein is produced in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and has an apparent molecular mass of
120 kD on SDS gel electrophoresis. Within 30 min the protein
is transported to the Golgi complex and increases in size by 40
kD due to the addition of N- and 0-linked sugars. From the
Golgi complex, the receptor is transported to the cell surface
where it binds its ligand, LDL, and is internalized by endocytosis (5). LDL receptor alleles with a so-called class 1 mutation
fail to produce any LDL receptor protein as determined by
immunoprecipitation with an anti-LDL receptor monoclonal
antibody (6). LDL receptor mutations of the class 2 phenotype
make a precursor protein that is not transported at a normal
rate from the ER to the Golgi complex, and the 120-kD precursor protein accumulates in the ER. Class 3 mutations produce an LDL receptor protein that is transported normally to
the cell surface, but fails to bind LDL. And finally, mutations
of the class 4 type make an LDL receptor protein that binds
LDL normally but fails to be internalized.
The frequency of FH differs quite dramatically in different
populations of the world. In the European and North American populations, the frequency of heterozygous FH is estimated to be 0.2% (1). However, in selected other populations
such as the Afrikaners of South Africa (7), the Christian Lebanese (8), and the French Canadians (9), the frequency of FH
has been found to be two- to fivefold higher. In these populations, one or two mutant alleles at the LDL receptor locus
predominate, unlike most populations where almost every
unrelated individual with FH has a different LDL receptor
mutation (Hobbs H. H., et al., unpublished observations). For
example, in the Afrikaners the frequency of FH has been estimated to be five times higher than the general European population, and two LDL receptor missense mutations comprise
> 95% of the mutant alleles in 12 Afrikaner FH homozygotes (10).
In the French Canadian population, the frequency of FH
has been estimated to be 0.5%, or about two to three times
the rate in the general population (9). A large deletion (> 10
kb) in the 5' region of the LDL receptor gene (which will be
referred to as the French Canadian deletion) has been shown
to comprise 60% of mutant LDL receptor alleles causing FH in
French Canadians from the Montreal area (11). It was previously speculated that the high frequency of this deletion
in the French Canadian population was due to the founder effect (1 1).
The present-day French Canadian population is descended
from - 6,000-7,000 original settlers who emigrated from
northeastern and western France to eastern Canada in the 17th
and 18th centuries ( 12). The French Canadians remained ge-

netically isolated from the English due to social and geographic
factors. They were mostly farmers and settled in more remote
areas as their numbers grew. The families were large and the
French Canadian population expanded rapidly after 1700.
Presumably, among the initial group of immigrants there were
individuals or families who had FH due to the French Canadian deletion. When the ancestries of some individuals with
the French Canadian deletion were traced (including one from
San Francisco and another from Massachusetts), all had ancestors from the same small town northeast of Montreal called
Kamouraska. This observation supports the hypothesis that
these families share ascendants (13).
Since a single mutation in the LDL receptor gene, i.e., the
French Canadian deletion, was found to make up 60% of the
mutant alleles in this population, the question arose whether
there were other common mutant LDL receptor alleles in the
remaining 40%. In another study, Ma et al. have identified a
5-kb deletion that includes exons 2 and 3 of the LDL receptor
gene, and this mutation was found in 5% of 80 French Canadian FH heterozygotes screened (14). To determine if there
were other common LDL receptor mutations in this population, we analyzed the LDL receptor genes of 11 French Canadian FH homozygotes. We used 10 restriction fragment length
polymorphisms (RFLPs) associated with LDL receptor locus
to construct haplotypes in order to estimate the number of
different mutant alleles in the sample (15). Only three different
LDL receptor haplotypes were identified and the coding region
of an allele associated with each haplotype was sequenced.
Three different missense mutations were found and assays
were developed to detect each of these mutations directly. The
molecular assays were used to screen the LDL receptor genes
from 130 FH heterozygotes from the greater Montreal area.

Methods
Materials. The restriction enzymes used for RFLP analysis were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Escherichia coli
DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) was obtained from Boehringer
Mannheim Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Thermus aquaticus DNA
polymerase and the thermal cycler used for DNA amplification were
obtained from Perkin Elmer Cetus (Norwalk, CT). The oligonucleotides used for DNA dot blot hybridization analysis were synthesized on
a DNA synthesizer model 280A obtained from Applied Biosystems
(Foster City, CA); genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells
using the nucleic acid extractor model 340A purchased from the same
company. [y-32P]ATP (7,000 Ci/mmol) used for end-labeling oligonucleotides was purchased from ICN Radiochemicals (Irvine, CA) and
the [35S]methionine (- 1,000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from New England Nuclear (Boston, MA). The nylon membranes used for oligonucleotide hybridization were purchased from ICN Radiochemicals.
IgG-C7 and IgG-200 1, mouse MAbs directed against amino acid residues 2-42 of the human LDL receptor and an irrelevant antibody,
respectively, were prepared as previously described (6, 16). The bacteriophage M 13 replicative form DNAs were obtained from Pharmacia
LKB (Piscataway, NJ).
Haplotype analysis of French Canadian FH homozygotes. Genomic DNA was isolated from fibroblasts that were cultured from skin
biopsy specimens of 11 French Canadian FH homozygotes. 8 Atg of
genomic DNA was digested with a fivefold excess of 10 different restriction enzymes shown previously to reveal RFLPs (15). Subsequent
to digestion, the DNA was fractionated on a 0.8% agarose gel and
transferred to a nylon membrane. The filters were hybridized with the
appropriate probes, and the LDL receptor haplotypes were determined
and numbered as previously reported (15).

DNA sequencing of mutant alleles. Each exon of the LDL receptor
gene was individually amplified from 1 jtg of genomic DNA from
either FH 883, FH 47, or FH 787 using the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and Taq polymerase as described (15, 17). In each reaction,
specific oligonucleotides, one end-labeled with [y-32P]ATP (18) and
one unlabeled, homologous to the intron sequences flanking the exon,
were used (Table II). The amplification products were size-fractionated
on a 6% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel in TBE (50 mM Tris at pH
8, 90 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA at pH 8.3). The band corresponding to the amplified exon sequence was excised from the gel, and the
DNA was purified before sequencing by the Maxam and Gilbert tech-

nique (19).

Oligonucleotide hybridization ofgenomic DNA. Exons 3, 4, and 14
of the LDL receptor gene were individually amplified by PCR using 1
,ug of genomic DNA and 25-base oligonucleotides homologous to sequences flanking each mutation. After 35 rounds of PCR-directed
amplification, one-tenth of the amplified DNA product was denatured
in 400 mM NaOH/25 mM sodium EDTA and dotted onto duplicate
nylon membranes as previously described (20). Oligonucleotides homologous to the normal and mutant sequences were end-labeled with
[y-32P]ATP (18) and purified using cetylpyridinium bromide (21). A
total of 1 X 106 cpm/ml of each oligonucleotide was hybridized individually to duplicate filters in 5X SSPE (IX SSPE contains 0.9 M
NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate, and 5 mM EDTA at pH 7.4), 0.05%
(vol/vol) each of BSA, Ficoll 400, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone 360 and
0.5% (vol/vol) SDS for 16 h at 420C. The filters were then washed
sequentially at different temperatures using the following buffers:
buffer A (2X SSPE, 0.5% [vol/vol] SDS); buffer B (IX SSPE, 0.25%
[vol/vol] SDS); buffer C (0.2X SSPE, 0.1% [vol/vol] SDS), and buffer
D (0.1 X SSPE, 0.1% [vol/vol] SDS). The filters were washed in buffers
A, B, and C at room temperature before washing in buffers C and D at
370C. Then they were washed in buffer D for 10 min at 420C and
45-520C. The final washing temperatures for each oligonucleotide
were as follows: 470C for both the mutant and normal oligo 47, 520C
for both mutant and normal oligo 883, 450C for the mutant oligo 787,
and 520C for the corresponding normal oligonucleotide. The filters
were exposed to XAR-5 (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) film for
1- 12 h at -70'C using an intensifying screen (Lightning Plus; DuPont
Instruments, Wilmington, DE).
Mutagenesis and transfection of mammalian cells. DNA fragments
from the expression plasmid pLDLR-2 were subeloned into the bacteriophage M 13 and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed as previously described (22, 23). A double-stranded fragment
that contained the mutation was subeloned into a plasmid containing
the normal human LDL receptor cDNA under the control of the
simian virus (SV) 40 early promoter (pLDLR-2). Three plasmids
called p883, p47, and p787 were constructed. Each plasmid had the
same missense mutation as had been found in the LDL receptor gene
of the corresponding FH homozygote fibroblast cell line. DNA from
the three plasmids was prepared, and after the mutation was confirmed
by sequencing, the DNA was transfected into COS-M6 cells as previously described (23). 2 d after transfection, the cells were radiolabeled
with [35S]methionine for 15 min, and then an excess of cold methionine was added to the media. After various time intervals, cell extracts
were made and the LDL receptors were immunoprecipitated using the
anti-LDL receptor MAbs, IgG-C7 (6). The immunoprecipitated proteins were fractionated on an SDS polyacrylamide gel. The apparent
molecular masses were calculated by reference to the following
markers: myosin (200 kD), B-galactosidase (116 kD), phosphorylase 6
(97 kD), BSA (68 kD), and ovalbumin (43 kD). The gel was exposed to
XAR-5 film for the times indicated in the legend of Fig. 2.

Results
Genomic DNA was extracted from blood leukocytes of 130
unrelated FH heterozygotes who reside within 50 miles of
Familial Hypercholesterolemia in French Canadians

1015

Montreal, Canada. Every FH heterozygote had an elevated
LDL level, tendon xanthomas, and a family history of hypercholesterolemia. Their pedigrees were constructed and none
were found to be related at the second degree level. Genomic
blotting was performed to assay for the presence of the French
Canadian deletion and the 5-kb deletion (data not shown) (1 1,
14). Of the 130 FH heterozygotes tested, 77 (59%) were found
to have the French Canadian deletion and four (3%) had the
'5-kb deletion.
To determine and identify the LDL receptor mutations
responsible for FH in the other 38% of these French Canadian
heterozygotes, LDL receptor haplotype analysis was performed using genomic DNA extracted from fibroblasts of 11
French Canadian FH homozygotes that had been cultured
from skin biopsy specimens by Dr. M. S. Brown and Dr. J. L.
Goldstein. The 11 French Canadian FH homozygotes are
listed in Table I. The city of origin of the physicians who sent
the skin biopsy specimens are given, as well as any history of
consanguinity. LDL receptor protein biosynthetic studies had
been previously performed using these cultured fibroblasts in

the laboratory of Dr. M. S. Brown and Dr. J. L. Goldstein. The
cells were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine for 2 h and then
washed for 2 h with cold methionine before immunoprecipitation using an anti-receptor MAb, IgG-C7. A quantification
of the amount of LDL receptor protein in the precursor (120
kD) and mature form (160 kD) was determined by densitometry, and the results are summarized in Table I. In normal
fibroblasts, 100% of the receptor protein is in the 160-kD mature form after a 2-h pulse and 2-h chase. The fibroblasts from
FH homozygotes 49, 549, 808, 859, and 896 produced no
immunoprecipitable protein and thus were of the class 1 phenotype. FH homozygotes 47, 787, and 896 produced an LDL
receptor precursor protein of normal size that failed to be
completely converted to the mature 160-kD form after a 2-h
chase. FH 883, 807, and 764 produced a protein of normal size
that was defective in cell surface binding to either LDL or
IgG-C7 (data not shown). Also included in Table I are the
results of RNA blot analysis and LDL receptor haplotype analysis which were performed as previously described (15, 24). Of
the 11 FH homozygotes, 8 were found to be homozygous for

the same haplotype, and subsequently were determined to be
homozygous for the same mutation (Nos. 1-8, Table I). Three
of the FE homozygotes were heterozygous for at least one
restriction site and thus were probably compound heterozygotes (Nos. 9-1 1, Table I). One FH homozygote, FH 764, was
half French Canadian; his mother was German and his father
was French Canadian, and therefore only his paternal allele
was included in the analysis.
Only three different LDL receptor haplotypes were found
among the 21 mutant LDL receptor alleles represented in this
sample: haplotype 3', haplotype 2, and haplotype 31 (Table I,
part B). The fact that only three haplotypes were identified
suggested that there may be only three LDL receptor mutations in the sample of 21 mutant LDL receptor alleles
screened. The DNA samples were assayed for the presence of
the French Canadian deletion by genomic blotting, and it was
determined that all the LDL receptor alleles of haplotype 3'
(57%) had the French Canadian deletion. None of the FH
homozygotes had the 5-kb deletion described by Ma et al. ( 14).
The rest of the mutant LDL alleles had either haplotype 2
(24%) or haplotype 31 (19%). FH 47 and FH 883 were each
homozygous for one of the two common haplotypes (haplotypes 2 and 31, respectively), and the coding regions of their
LDL receptor genes were sequenced.
Oligonucleotides homologous to intron sequences flanking
each of exons 1-17 and the 5' region of exon 18 of the LDL
receptor gene (Table II) were used to amplify the coding region
of the gene by PCR from genomic DNA of FH 47 and FH 883.
For each exon, the amplified DNA fragment containing the
exon sequence was purified and subsequently sequenced by
the technique of Maxam and Gilbert (19). One basepair substitution was identified in each FH homozygote when the sequence was compared with the LDL receptor cDNA sequence
(25) (Fig. 1). In Fig. 1 A, the sequence of the coding strand of
exon 3 from a normal individual is compared with FH 883. A
single basepair change (a thymidine to guanine substitution)
was identified in codon 66, and this substitution would predict
an amino acid change of tryptophan to glycine. Fig. 1 B shows
partial sequence of exon 14 from both a normal individual and
FH 47 (who was homozygous for LDL receptor haplotype 2).
A basepair change (guanine to adenine) results in an amino
acid substitution of tyrosine for cysteine at position 646. FH
787, a French Canadian FH homozygote who was also homozygous for LDL receptor haplotype 2, did not have this mutation as was initially anticipated. Therefore, the coding region
of FH 787 was sequenced and a single basepair substitution
was identified in the 3' end of exon 4 when the noncoding
strand was sequenced. In the third position of codon 207, a
cytosine to thymidine transition was identified resulting in a
glutamic acid to lysine substitution (Fig. 1 C).
To confirm that these three amino acid substitutions were
not polymorphisms, each mutation was reproduced in a expression plasmid containing the normal LDL receptor cDNA
under the control of the simian virus (SV) 40 promoter and
expressed transiently in transfected COS-M6 cells. 48 h after
transfection, biosynthetic studies of the LDL receptor protein
were performed (Fig. 2). The cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine for 15 min before chasing with cold methionine for
15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min. The cell extracts were subjected to
immunoprecipitation using IgG-C7 and the products were
size-fractionated on a polyacrylamide-SDS gel before performing autoradiography. The results of three separate experi-

ments are shown (Fig. 2). In each experiment the LDL receptor protein produced by cells transfected with the mutant
cDNA was compared with cells transfected with the normal
LDL receptor cDNA. Since similar results were obtained in
the three experiments using the plasmid expressing the normal
LDL receptor cDNA, only one example is given (Fig. 2 A).
Using normal fibroblasts, after a 15-min pulse and no chase
only the 1 20-kD precursor protein was seen. By 60 min almost
half of the LDL receptor protein was in the mature 160-kD
form. It was previously shown by Esser et al. that when the
LDL receptor is expressed in COS cells, the processing of the
protein from the 120- to the 160-kD mature form is slower
than in fibroblasts (23, 26). Similar results were observed in the
current studies. After a 15-min pulse, at least 1 h of chase was
required before 50% of the receptor was in its mature 160-kD
form. Fig. 2 B shows the results of COS cells transfected with
p47 (Cys6' -- Tyr). Even after a 120-min chase the LDL
receptor precursor protein failed to be converted to the mature
form, which is identical to what was observed in the biosynthetic studies performed using fibroblasts from FH 47 (Table
I). Fig. 2 C shows the results of the same study using cells
transfected with a plasmid containing the LDL receptor cDNA
with the mutation identical to that found in FH 787 (G8U207-*
Lys). These cells produced a protein that was processed more
slowly than normal, but unlike FH 47, some of the receptor
protein did get processed to the mature 160-kD form. This is

consistent with biosynthetic studies of fibroblasts from the FH
homozygote 787 (Table I). Finally, Fig. 2 D shows the results
of using a plasmid with the (Trp66 Gly) mutation found in
FH 883. The mutation did not result in any difference in LDL
receptor processing, which is consistent with the biosynthetic
studies previously performed in fibroblasts from this individual.
The 49 French Canadian FH heterozygotes who did not
have the French Canadian deletion or the 5-kb deletion described by Ma et al. ( 14) were analyzed for the presence of one
of the-three missense mutations identified in the French Canadian FH homozygotes. The exons containing the three mutations were individually amplified by PCR, and the amplified
DNA was fixed to duplicate nylon filters. The filters were selectively hybridized with an allele-specific, kinased, 20-base oligonucleotide encoding either the normal or the mutant sequence
(Fig. 3). Amplified genomic DNA from a normal individual,
the three FH homozygotes known to be homozygous for each
of the three missense mutations described, two compound heterozygotes (FH 893 and FH 807), and six French Canadian
FR heterozygotes were compared. Fig. 3 A shows the results of
the dot blot analysis after hybridization with a normal and
mutant oligonucleotide that were homologous to the sequences flanking and including the mutation found in FH
883. The normal probe hybridized to the amplified exon 3specific DNA from a normal individual but not with the DNA
from FH 883. The mutant probe (oligo 883) hybridized only
with the DNA from FH 883 and not the normal individual.
The normal probe hybridized with FR 47 and FH 787, which
confirmed that their LDL receptor mutations were located
elsewhere in the gene. FH 807 and 893 had previously been
shown to be compound heterozygotes; in each, one allele had
the French Canadian deletion while the other did not. Both the
normal and mutant probe (oligo 883) hybridized with the amplified DNA from FH 807, whereas only the normal oligonucleotide hybridized with 893. Also shown is a subset of the 49

French Canadian FH heterozygotes that were analyzed, and
four out of the six were found to be heterozygous for this
mutation.
Fig. 3 B shows a similar analysis of exon 14-specific DNA
amplified from the same FH homozygotes and six different
FH heterozygotes. The duplicate filters were hybridized with
end-labeled oligonucleotides homologous to the normal or the
mutant sequence. Again, only the normal oligonucleotide hybridized to the normal DNA and the DNA from the other two
true homozygotes, FH 883 and 787, but it did not hybridize to

the amplified DNA from FH 47. Oligo 47 hybridized with the
DNA from FH 47 and both the normal and mutant oligo
hybridized with FH 893. Therefore, FH 893 is heterozygous
for this mutation. Finally, Fig. 3 C shows the same analysis
using amplified DNA samples from exon 4 after hybridizing
with an oligonucleotide homologous to the normal exon 4
sequence and that found in FH 787.
A compilation of the results of the dot blot hybridization
analysis for the FH heterozygotes and homozygotes is shown
in Table III. Almost 60% of the heterozygotes screened had the

dian descent. These three mutations, together with the two
previously identified deletions (1 1, 14), make up 76% of the
mutant LDL receptor alleles causing FH in the French Canadian population, at least in the Montreal region. The frequency of FH in French Canadians in Quebec province has
been recently estimated to be 1 in 270 (9). This frequency is
approximately two times higher than seen in most other populations of the world (1). The frequency was found to be even
higher (1 in 154) in the northeastern part of Quebec province
(9). The cause of the high frequency of FH in this population is
thought to be the founder effect (1 1), which is supported by
this study. Only five mutations at the LDL receptor locus
comprise three-quarters of the mutant LDL receptor alleles
causing FH in this population.
To identify the mutations that predominate in the French
Canadian population, LDL receptor haplotype analysis was
used to analyze the LDL receptor genes in 11 French Canadian
FH homozygotes. Previously, it was shown at other loci that
different mutations are often in linkage disequilibrium with
particular allele haplotypes (27). 10 RFLPs associated with the
LDL receptor gene were used to determine the LDL receptor
haplotypes in the FH homozygotes (15). Only three LDL receptor haplotypes were identified in the 21 mutant LDL receptor alleles surveyed. Three of the FH homozygotes who did
not have the French Canadian deletion were homozygous at
every site. Homozygosity for all 10 restriction sites suggested
homozygosity for a mutation since the heterozygosity index
using the 10 RFLPs was previously shown to be 85% (15). The
coding regions of the LDL receptor gene from these three
fibroblast cell lines were sequenced in their entirety and different basepair substitutions were identified that result in single
amino acid changes. The basepair substitutions were conclusively shown to be responsible for the altered LDL receptor
protein phenotype in FH 47 and 787 by reproducing and expressing the mutations in vitro.
Both of the mutations found in FH 47 and FH 787 result in
the production of an LDL receptor protein of the class 2 phenotype. To date, seven other LDL receptor mutations, including three small in-frame deletions (28, 29), one nonsense mutation (30), and three missense mutations (20, 31, 32) have
been reported to result in a similar phenotype. When immunocytochemical studies were performed on cultured fibroblasts from an FH homozygote with this phenotype, the LDL
receptor was found to be concentrated in the transitional elements of the ER (33). Numerous studies have demonstrated

that the transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi complex is a highly regulated process and denatured or malfolded
proteins are not transported normally out of the ER to the
Golgi complex (34, 35). So presumably the mutations at the
LDL receptor locus that result in a class 2 phenotype somehow
interfere with the proper folding of the LDL receptor protein.
The mechanism by which the malfolded protein is recognized
and retained in the ER is not clear.
The LDL receptor mutations of the class 2 type cluster in
two functional domains of the LDL receptor gene; the ligandbinding domain and the epidermal growth factor precursor
homology domain. The ligand-binding domain is encoded by
exons 2-6 and consists of seven cysteine-rich repeats that are
- 40 amino acids in length. It is to this region of the protein
that the ligands for the LDL receptor, including LDL and
#l-VLDL, bind. There is a highly conserved triplet of negatively
charged amino acids (ser-asp-glu) that is found near the
COOH terminus of each ligand binding repeat. In the fifth
ligand-binding repeat of FH 787 there is a substitution of a
lysine for the glutamic acid residue at the terminal position of
this conserved triplet. This substitution results in a change of a
basic for an acidic amino acid residue which somehow interferes with the folding of the LDL receptor protein so that it is
not transported out of the ER at a normal rate.
The mutation in FH 47 is located in the epidermal growth
factor precursor homology domain. This region of the LDL
receptor protein is encoded by exons 7-14 and is 400 amino
acids in length. It contains three repeats (A, B, and C) which
are 40 amino acids in length, and each repeat contains six
cysteine residues. The mutation in FH 47 is in exon 14 which
encodes the C repeat, and the missense mutation results in the
substitution of a tyrosine for one of the six cysteine residues.
The effect of this mutation is to completely block the transport of the protein out of the ER. It is tempting to attribute the
defect in processing to the loss of a cysteine residue. If all of the
six cysteines normally form disulfide bonds within the repeat,
this would leave a single unpaired cysteine residue. This unpaired cysteine may then form a disulfide bond with another
protein. However, Esser and Russell (31) have shown that the
presence of an unpaired cysteine residue in the C repeat of the
LDL receptor protein is not necessary or sufficient to produce
a defect in the transport of the protein out of the ER. Rather, it
seems that exon 14 is very sensitive to changes in its sequence
and its requirements for proper folding and resulting transport
are quite stringent (31).

Familial Hypercholesterolemia in French Canadians

The amino acid substitution in FH 883 is located in the
second ligand binding repeat and does not interfere with the
processing of the LDL receptor protein. However, it does interfere with either the binding of the receptor to its ligand or
the turnover of the LDL receptor protein. Unfortunately, the
amount of expression ofthis plasmid in COS cells was too low
to perform either binding or protein turnover studies.
The mutations found in FH 47 and 883 have not yet been
seen in any individuals outside of Quebec. However, the basepair substitution identified in FH 787 has been found in another FH homozygote, FH 525. The RFLP haplotype linked to
a mutation can be used to estimate the number of times the
mutation has occurred, as has been done at the (l-globin locus
for sickle cell anemia and a subset of mutations causing #-thalassemia (36-38). If the same mutation is found in unrelated
individuals on an allele of an identical RFLP haplotype, it is
likely that they share an ascendent. If, however, the mutation
is found on a very different haplotype, then it is probable that
the mutation has occurred more than once, assuming that it
was not an ancient event. FH 525 is from Mexico and though
he is homozygous for the same mutation as FH 787 the mutation is found on an LDL receptor allele of a completely different haplotype. FH 525 is homozygous for haplotype 31 and
FH 787 is homozygous for haplotype 2; these two haplotypes
differ at four sites (see Table I, part B). The fact that the same
mutation is present on LDL receptor alleles of different haplotypes suggests that the mutation occurred more than once. The
mutation consists of a base-substitution of a thymidine for a
cytosine at a CpG dimer, and CpG dimers have been shown to
be hot spots for mutational events in the human genome

(39, 40).

The high frequency of FH in the French Canadian population is presumed to be due to the founder effect. This is supported by the fact that when families with the French Canadian deletion were traced back to the original immigrants, they
were all found to originate from the same region (13). The
mutations described in this paper are less frequent then the
French Canadian deletion, and this may represent later entry
of the mutations into the population. The frequency of the
mutations may vary significantly in other regions of Quebec
province due to differences in the migration patterns of the
early settlers. A demographic study of each mutation would
facilitate the analysis of LDL receptor gene mutations in the
French Canadians.
By performing Southern blot analysis to detect the two
deletions, and dot blot oligonucleotide hybridization studies to
detect the three missense mutations, 76% of the mutant alleles
responsible for FH in the Montreal region can be detected
directly. The percentages for each of the mutations may be
quite different in other regions of Eastern Canada. The ability
to detect mutations at the LDL receptor locus directly in a
majority of individuals with FH will facilitate the prenatal
diagnosis of homozygous FH in the French Canadian population. The assays can also be used to confirm the diagnosis of
FH in a patient where the clinical diagnosis is not clear.
Whether or not any of these mutations are a common cause of
FH in France has not been investigated.
