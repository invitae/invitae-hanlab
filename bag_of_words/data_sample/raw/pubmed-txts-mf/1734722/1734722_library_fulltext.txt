Summary
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the LDL receptor
gene. Here we characterize an LDL receptor mutation that is associated with a distinct haplotype and causes
FH in the Druze, a small Middle Eastern Islamic sect with a high degree of inbreeding. The mutation was
found in FH families from two distinct Druze villages from the Golan Heights (northern Israel). It was not
found neither in another Druze FH family residing in a different geographical area nor in eight Arab and four
Jewish FH heterozygote index cases whose hypercholesterolemia cosegregates with an identical LDL receptor gene haplotype. The mutation, a single-base substitution, results in a termination codon in exon 4 of the
LDL receptor gene that encodes for the fourth repeat of the binding domain of the mature receptor. It can
be diagnosed by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization of PCR-amplified DNA from FH patients.
Introduction

The LDL receptor is a cell-surface glycoprotein-mediating endocytosis of LDL and thus regulates plasma
cholesterol (Brown and Goldstein 1986). Mutations in
the LDL receptor gene cause the autosomal dominant
disease familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) which is
prevalent in about 0.2% of the general world population (Goldstein and Brown 1989). Individuals found
to be heterozygous for a mutation in this gene have an
elevated plasma LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) level and an
increased risk for the development of ischemic heart
disease (IHD).
The Druze are a small Middle Eastern Islamic sect
characterized by an eclectic system of doctrines and
by a cohesion and loyalty among its members that have
enabled them to maintain their identity and distinctive
faith through almost 1,000 years (Goetz 1986). It is

estimated that the Druze currently number 775,000,
of which 75,000 reside in Israel (Israeli General Encyclopedia 1990). In this community a high degree of
inbreeding is evident, and the prevalence of consanguineous marriages is the highest of all groups in Israel
and reaches 49% (Freundlich and Hino 1984). It is
thus expected that mutant genes would proliferate in
this community because of founder mechanisms and
possible genetic drift. Here we describe an LDL receptor gene mutation that is responsible for FH in Druze
families that reside in two different villages in the Golan Heights in Israel and who represent distinct Druze

lineages.
Material and Methods
Material

Restriction endonucleases, DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment), and other enzymes were obtained
from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Boehringer
Mannheim (Mannheim) and Pharmacia (Piscataway,
NJ). DNA sequence analysis was done using Sequenasetm (United States Biochemical, Cleveland). Other
chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical (St.

Louis). Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase I was
obtained from Perkin Elmer-Cetus (Norwalk, CT).
[a-32P] dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and [y_32p] ATP
(7,000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from New England
Nuclear (NEN) (Boston). Nylon membranes were
purchased from Biotransm ICN Biochemical (Irvine,
CA) and GeneScreen' (NEN). Oligonucleotides were
synthesized by Biotechnology (Rehovot, Israel). DNA
was amplified using the Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research). LDL (density = 1.019-1.063
g/ml) and lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) (density
> 1.25 g/ml) were prepared from human plasma, and
the LDL was iodinated by the iodine monochloride
method, all according to methods described elsewhere
(Aulinskas et al. 1983). The monoclonal anti-LDL
receptor antibody, IgG-C7, was prepared from hybridoma cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL/691) and was iodinated using
iodogen (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL) according to
the method of Beisiegel et al. (1981). Goat anti-mouse
IgG (GAM-IgG) was purchased from Cappel Laboratories (Malvern, PA). Na'251 was from Amersham
(Buckinghamshire), and 35S-methionine was from
NEN (Du Pont, Wilmington, DE). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and methionine-free
Eagle's minimum essential medium were provided by
Highveld Biologicals (Kelvin, South Africa). Plasma
lipids were determined on a Vitatron model FPS-A
autoanalyser (Avro Scientific Instruments, Sunnyvale,
CA). Additional materials are indicated where appropriate.
Recruitment of Patients and Families
Druze families with hypercholesterolemia were recruited through the Lipid Research Unit of The Rambam Medical Center in Haifa. Inclusion criteria for
the index cases were as follows: hypercholesterolemia
(plasma LDL-C level above the 95th percentile for
age and gender), tendon xanthomas, and history of
premature (age <60 years) IHD. For each patient and
family member a fasting blood sample was collected
in 0.15% (w/v) EDTA and was shipped on ice to the
Lipid Research Laboratory at the Hadassah Medical
Center in Jerusalem for biochemical analysis and genomic DNA extraction. The following diagnostic criteria were used for the detection of homozygotes:
plasma LDL-C >600 mg/dl and appearance of xanthomatosis during the first decade of life.

agnostic kits (Boehringer Mannheim). Plasma LDL-C
levels were calculated according to the Friedewald- Levy
formula (Friedewald et al. 1972).
LDL Receptor Assays

Skin fibroblasts from an LDL receptor-normal person and from an FH homozygote patient (FH 350-3)
of one of the Druze families were cultured, and LDL
receptors were up-regulated for 48 h in medium containing LPDS, all according to methods described elsewhere (Grant et al. 1990). For surface binding at 40Cf
of either 125I-LDL or '251-IgG-C7, cells were incubated
for 2 h in DMEM supplemented with LPDS buffered
with 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) and containing the indicated amounts of 125I-labeled ligands. The rate of degradation of the 125I-labeled ligands at 37Â°C was determined according to a method described elsewhere
(Goldstein et al. 1983). For [35S] labeling and analysis
of LDL receptors, cells were incubated with [35S] methionine (50 gCi/ml) in methionine-free medium and
were chased in DMEM/LPDS containing 200 pM unlabeled methionine. LDL receptors were solubilized,
immunoprecipitated using IgG-C7/GAM-IgG immune complexes, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography, all according to methods described elsewhere (Tolleshaug et al. 1982).
Haplotype Analysis at the LDL Receptor Gene Locus

Genomic DNA was extracted from blood leukocytes (Hobbs et al. 1986) and diluted to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. LDL receptor gene haplotypes
were constructed through the analysis of the joint segregation of 10 RFLPs, according to a method described elsewhere (Leitersdorf et al. 1989a).

Biochemical Determinations

DNA Amplification and Sequence Analysis
Total RNA was isolated from human skin fibroblasts of a homozygote case by the guanidine thiocyanate method (Chirgwin et al. 1979). Complementary
DNA was prepared using a random hexamer oligonucleotide primer and M-MLV reverse transcriptase
(200 U/pl) (Gibco-BRL, New York). DNA amplification was done according to the method of Saiki et
al. (1988), using the first-strand cDNA as a template.
The whole coding region of the LDL receptor cDNA,
including exons 1-18 was amplified using five sets
of oligonucleotides. For the amplification of exons
1-4, upstream oligonucleotide primer designated AR12
(5'-A TAGGATCCAAATTGCGCTGGACCGTCGCCTTGC-3') that is homologous to exon 1 sequences

Plasma total triglycerides, cholesterol, and HDL-C
levels were determined using commercially available di-

AR13 (5'-A TAGCATGCTCGTCAGGGCGACAG-

and downstream oligonucleotide primer designated

Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Druze

GTGGCCACAG-3') that is homologous to exon 5
sequences were used. These oligonucleotides were designed to include also six-nucleotide 5' extensions with
the consensus sequence for BamHI and SphI restriction endonucleases, respectively (underlined in above
sequences), and three additional nucleotides (italicized in above sequences). The PCR protocol included
1.5 min of denaturation at 940C and 5 min of annealing and extension at 680C, with the Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase enzyme for 35 cycles. After amplification, the PCR products were analyzed on a
1.5% agarose gel, and the appropriate band was extracted, purified, and subjected to BamHI/SphI digestion followed by subcloning into bacteriophage Ml 3.
Sequence analysis of both strands of two independent
M13 clones was performed using the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method (Sanger et al. 1977).
Detection of the Druze Mutation
Oligonucleotides Dl (5'-CCCCAGCTGTGGGCCTGCGACAACG-3') and D2 (5'-CGCCCATACCGCAGTTTTCC-3') were used for amplification of the
3' end of exon 4 of the LDL receptor gene according
to a method described elsewhere (Leitersdorf et al.
1989b). After amplification, the DNA was size fractionated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, and the band
sizes were verified. Each one of the PCR products was
denatured in 0.4 N NaOH/0.025 M EDTA and was
dot blotted twice on a nylon membrane (GeneScreen.";
NEN) and hybridized to [32P]-end-labeled allelespecific oligonucleotide probes (oligonucleotide 350NL 5'-GTCTTTACGTGTTCCAA-3' and oligonucleotide 350-MU 5'-GTCTTTAGGTGTTCCAA-3'),
homologous to the normal and to the mutant genes,
respectively. The filters were prehybridized at 430C
in 5 x SSPE /5 x Denhardt's solution/0.5% SDS for
20 min and then hybridized with 1 x 106 cpm/ml
end-labeled oligonucleotide for 1 h. The filters were
then washed in 2 x SSPE/0.1% SDS three times (for
5 min each) at room temperature, once for 10 min at
46Â°C, and once for 3 min at 53Â°C. Autoradiography
was performed at - 70Â°C for 5 h on Kodak XAR-5
film. After autoradiography the filters were stripped
at 75Â°C, and those that were originally hybridized
with the normal probe were rehybridized with the mutant probe, and vice versa.
Results
Druze FH families were recruited from the follow-

ing three villages: Majdal Shams (family FH 350) and
Ein Kuniye (family FH 367) (from the Golan Heights

429
in northeastern Israel) and Isfiya (family FH 351)
(from the Carmel Mountains in northwestern Israel).
In one family with a homozygote case (FH 350-3),
parental consanguinity could be demonstrated. Analysis of 10 RFLPs at the LDL receptor gene locus in
families FH 350 and FH 367 revealed that haplotype
1 (BsmI +, SphI +, StuI +, AvaIl +, SpeI -, ApaLI5' + , PvuII - , NcoI + , PstI + , and ApaLI-3' + ) cosegregates with hypercholesterolemia in both families
(data not shown). Haplotype analysis was not carried
out on individuals from family FH 351.
Fibroblast cultures were prepared from a clinically
homozygote Druze FH patient (FH 350-3) who was
found also to be homozygous for LDL receptor haplotype 1. The binding and degradation of 125I-LDL and
125I-IgG-C7 monoclonal antibody was studied in fibroblasts from FH 350-3 and from a normal control
(table 1). The mutant cells exhibited a lack of functional LDL receptors, being unable to specifically bind
or degrade either 125I-LDL or 125I-IgG-C7 monoclonal
antibody. The synthesis and processing of LDL receptors in cells from the homozygote patient and from the
normal control were also compared. Whereas both
precursor and mature forms of the LDL receptor, biosynthetically labeled with 35S-methionine, were found
in normal cells, no LDL receptor protein was detected
in either mutant cell extracts or in culture medium
from the mutant cells (data not shown).
After these initial observations, PCR amplification
of the whole coding region of the LDL receptor gene
of FH 350-3 was performed. The size of amplified
products were identical to that in a control sample and
were as expected from the known cDNA sequence.
The PCR fragments were then subcloned into a bacteriophage M13 vector. Sequence analysis of exons 1318 of the gene was performed and did not reveal any
abnormality. Subsequently, a guanine-for-cytosine
substitution that converts codon 167 from a tyrosine
to a stop codon (fig. 1) was identified in exon 4. This
was the only sequence abnormality that was found in
exons 1-4 of the gene.
Detection of the Druze mutation was based on DNA
amplification of the 3' end of exon 4, followed by
hybridization to end-labeled allele-specific oligonucleotide probes (fig. 2). By this method it was found that
the mutation is present in FH individuals from families
FH 350 and FH 367. It is not present either in family
FH 351 or in eight additional index cases of other
Arab communities, including seven Moslems and one
Christian who was previously shown not to carry the
Lebanese allele (Oppenheim et al., in press). Screening
of four Jewish FH heterozygote index cases whose

Analysis of 35 individuals from two Druze families

which is close to the normal range, and four controls
were found to have LDL-C levels above the 95th percentile for their age. These results indicate the possibility that other mutant genes and/or environmen-

DNA sequence analysis of mutant LDL receptor
gene from FH 350-3. Genomic DNA was amplified using oligonucleotides that are complementary to exon 1 and exon 5 sequences
of the LDL receptor gene (see Material and Methods). These oligonucleotides include also the consensus sequences for BamHI and
SphI restriction enzymes, respectively. After amplification, the PCR
products were digested with BamHI and SphI and were subcloned
into the polylinker site of bacteriophage Ml 3. Sequence analysis of
the coding strand of a homozygote FH patient (FH 350-3) and of a
normal control was performed using the dideoxy chain-termination
method. A guanine-for-cytosine substitution that is expected to result in a nonsense codon is evident in the mutant gene.

Discussi
In the present study we have characterized an LDL
receptor gene mutation in FH families of Druze origin
who resiide in the Golan Heights. The mutation, a
single-baise substitution, results in a premature termination c()don at amino acid residue number 167 in the
fourth rccpeat of the binding domain of the receptor.
It is the ifirst mutation characterized at the molecular
level in tlhis community. Experiments in fibroblast cultures revealed the absence of immunoprecipitable protein. Thte mutation is thus classified as a class 1 (null)
mutatiori (Brown and Goldstein 1986). A recent study
revealed that, among 20 FH homozygotes bearing
class 1 E)henotype, 15 different mutations could be
demonst:rated, eight of which have thus far been characterizedt at the molecular level (Hobbs et al. 1988,
1990). NZone of these were found to be identical to the
mutation characterized here. Some of the known LDL
receptor mutant alleles have been found to be sporadic, wihereas certain mutations are common in several definied populations (Hobbs et al. 1987; Lehrman
et al. 19837; Aalto-Setala et al. 1989; Leitersdorf et al.
1989b, 1 990; Meiner et al. 1991). Here we show that
the Druz(e mutation could be unique to the Druze sect,

The Druze mutation adds to the relatively large
number of naturally occurring point mutations that
have been localized to exon 4 of the LDL receptor.
This may reflect the functional
importance of those
0repeats of the receptor binding domain (repeats 3-5)
that are encoded by exon 4 (Hobbs et al. 1990). The
Druze mutation occurs in a CpG dinucleotide, a sequence known to be a mutational hot spot because of
the transition of methylated C residues (occurring only
in CpG dinucleotides) to T residues that is a result of
deamination (Cooper and Krawczak 1990). However,
such a mechanism is clearly not applicable in the case
of the Druze mutation, which corresponds to a C-to-G
transition.
The Druze sect was founded in the 11th century
and remained isolated because of religious restrictions
prohibiting outbreeding. For example, several genetic
markers that were examined among the Druze show
significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg distribution, because of increased homozygosity which might
be explained by a high degree of consanguinity (Nevo
1988). Krabbe disease, a rare progressive autosomal
recessive neurodegenerative disorder, is prevalent in a
large Druze kindred in Israel, probably because of the
same mechanism (Zlotogora 1985). The prevalence
of FH in the Druze is unknown. Because of the high
degree of consanguinity, as well as the existence of this
population in a localized area for an extended period
of time, a significant founder effect with high frequency of the mutant gene reported here is expected.
Figure 3 reveals, in two Druze families (FH 350
and FH 367), a wide range of LDL-C levels among
individuals carrying the Druze mutant allele as well as
among siblings who do not harbor the Druze mutation
but who, in some cases, are hypercholesterolemic.
These findings indicate that, in addition to the mutation reported here, other major effects (mutant genes
and/or environmental factors) may contribute to hypercholesterolemia in this community. The relative
impact of these factors on the prevalence of IHD in the
Druze population is unknown. This issue is currently
under investigation.
