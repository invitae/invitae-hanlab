Research Unit, Royal Children's Hospital, Victoria, Australia

An epidemiological and genetical study of osteogenesis imperfecta (01) in Victoria,
Australia confirmed that there are at least four distinct syndromes at present called 01.
The largest group of patients showed autosomal dominant inheritance of osteoporosis leading to
fractures and distinctly blue sclerae. A large proportion of adults had presenile deafness or a family
history of presenile conductive hearing loss.
A second group, who comprised the majority of newborns with neonatal fractures, all died before
or soon after birth. These had characteristic broad, crumpled femora and beaded ribs in skeletal
x-rays. Autosomal recessive inheritance was likely for some, if not all, of these cases.
A third group, two thirds of whom had fractures at birth, showed severe progressive deformity of
limbs and spine. The density of scleral blueness appeared less than that seen in the first group of
patients and approximated that seen in normal children and adults. Moreover, the blueness appeared
to decrease with age. All patients in this group wer_ sporadic cases. The mode of inheritance was not
resolved by the study, but it is likely that the group is heterogeneous with both dominant and recessive
genotypes responsible for the syndrome.
The fourth group of patients showed dominant inheritance of osteoporosis leading to fractures,
with variable deformity of long bones, but normal sclerae.
SUMMARY

Osteogenesis imperfecta (01) is a heritable syndrome
characterised by one or more of the features of
osteoporosis leading to fractures, blue sclerae,
impaired hearing, defective dentition, and hyperlaxibility present throughout life (Smars, 1961).
There is wide variability in the presence and severity
of the features among patients. Some patients have
considerable skeletal deformity with normal sclerae,
others have little deformity with very blue sclerae,
while a small proportion of cases die in the newborn
period.
It has been argued that these diverse presentations
represent the variable penetrance and expression of a
single mutant dominant gene (Caniggia et al., 1958;
Smars, 1961), or a closely linked dominant gene
complex (Seedorf, 1949). However, pedigrees with
autosomal recessive inheritance have been reported,
including those by Kaplan and Baldino (1953),
Rohwedder (1953), Goldfarb and Ford (1954),
Adaita (1957), Awwaad and Reda (1960), Chawla
(1964), Maloney (1969), Remigio and Grinvalsky
(1970), McKusick (1972), Wilson (1974), Horan and
Beighton (1975), and Tsuruta and Sugiura (1977).
In recent years, it has been proposed that there are

several varieties of OI (Cocchi, 1964; Ibsen, 1967;
Francis et al., 1975; McKusick, 1975). Biochemical
studies on cultured fibroblasts (Penttinen et al., 1975)
and skin collagen (Bauze et al., 1975; Francis et al.,
1975) from patients with 01 support the proposed
heterogeneity. Accordingly, a review of osteogenesis
imperfecta was undertaken in Victoria, to look for
genetic heterogeneity and to clarify the relationship
between surviving and lethal cases.
Methods

Victoria, Australia, has a population of 3 746 000
(Census, 1976) and an annual birth rate of approximately 60 000 live births. A large proportion of the
population lives in Melbourne and its satellite cities.
Country people with rare conditions such as OI are
likely to travel to Melbourne at least once in a lifetime for specialist opinion and treatment. Therefore,
a case-finding study based upon Melbourne and its
satellite population centres would be likely to
ascertain the majority of cases in the state.
Most babies are delivered in maternity hospitals,
and the majority of babies with congenital defects
and children with chronic disorders are referred to
two children's hospitals for diagnosis and manage-

102
ment. The state has a Consultative Committee on
Perinatal Mortality, established in 1961, to which all
stillbirths and neonatal deaths are reported. Since
1965, the majority of, if not all, babies who died in
the perinatal period with 01 have been reported to
this Committee.
Patients were ascertained from a search of hospital
records of 10 Melbourne metropolitan hospitals and
the central hospitals of its satellite cities. For newborn lethal cases, the search was concentrated on the
years 1965 to 1977. For other cases, patient diagnosis
registrations were searched for the years 1955 to
1977. Several hospitals had a disease index established before 1955, but the majority did not. Therefore, ascertainment before 1955 was unreliable.
Further cases were ascertained from colleagues in
orthopaedic and radiological practice and from the
registers of organisations for handicapped children
and adults. The cases of perinatal death ascertained
due to 01 were verified by the Consultative Committee on Perinatal Mortality. A number of patients,
mainly adults, were identified solely through relatives
previously ascertained and interviewed.
When names of patients were found, permission
was sought from their usual doctor to interview
them and their parents. No patient ascertained
through public hospitals refused interview and
examination, though a number of mildly affected
individuals ascertained through a more severely
affected family member refused interview. Hospital
case notes, x-rays, and histopathology sections and
reports, when available, were reviewed for all
patients studied. Non-familial cases of OI were
especially sought out and all except one case
ascertained were examined. The minimum dominant
mutation rate calculations assumed that nonfamilial cases were highly likely to have been
ascertained, since their parents would have sought
referral to a specialist centre for opinion and
management.
A pedigree was constructed for each family.
Information bearing on the symptoms of 01 was
sought concerning all family members. Affected
individuals were examined and data were recorded on
a protocol sheet for computer analysis. The range of
the data collected is summarised in Table 1. Computer analysis was performed using the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences (Nie et al., 1975).
A scale of blue-grey hue of varying densities,
graded from 1 to 6, was constructed by a paint
manufacturer. The hue was matched directly to the
sclera of one of the patients. It was found to be
consistent in hue with the blue sclerae of all patients
examined.
Scleral hue and density were assessed in daylight,
though not in direct sunlight or shade. An estimate

of grade was made by recording the density which was
most representative of the eyeball. Patients and their
sibs, parents, and where possible other relatives,
were examined and the results recorded.
Reliable fracture data were obtained for many
cases by comparing medical records and radiographic reports. In the patients with fractures at birth,
skeletal x-rays taken at birth were examined and the
number of fractures counted. For the majority of
adult patients with large numbers of fractures, no
reliable total estimate could be obtained.
Deformity of the skeleton was assessed by inspection and palpation. Scoliosis was assessed with the
patient bending forward (Blount, 1969). It was
graded as mild, moderate, and severe on clinical
grounds, Standing or sitting anterior-posterior
x-rays were performed where possible on all those
with clinical scoliosis. As experience accumulated,
it was appreciated that most patients assessed
clinically with moderate scoliosis had curves which
would be regarded radiographically as severe or
progressive if the patients were prepubertal.
Hearing was not formally tested during the interview with patients and parents, but a history of
hearing impairment was sought from patients and
their relatives. Some patients had had formal audiometric evaluation and the results of testing were
obtained for confirmation of hearing status. Other
patients had frank hearing impairment. The frequency reported in the study, therefore, underestimates the true frequency of hearing loss in the
patients studied. A follow-up audiometric study is
being undertaken to assess the hearing status of
patients and their parents ascertained in the study.
Birthweights and lengths for the patients examined
were obtained. Centiles appropriate to gestation were
derived by comparison with intrauterine growth
charts (Kitchen, 1968a, b). Height or length and
head circumferences were measured in centimetres
and weight in kilograms. Centiles were derived from
curves prepared by Tanner et al. (1966). As satisfactory centile charts do not exist for adults, adult
measurements were compared with centiles available for individuals aged 19 years for weight and
height, and 15 years for head circumference.

Results

One hundred and fifty-four individuals living in
Victoria, and two patients from other states who
were regularly receiving treatment in Victoria, were
ascertained. Ninety-one were personally examined
and a most striking observation was made. A group Table 2 Distribution ofpatients ascertained with

babies with lethal perinatal 01 (discussed as group 2)
for analysis.
Altogether, 180 patients with osteogenesis imperfecta were ascertained and studied (Table 2). Three
additional patients with non-familial, infancy-onset
osteoporosis, in whom the diagnosis of 01 had been
entertained, were excluded from the analysis since
they had atypical features. One had marked short
stature, mental retardation, hypotelorism, blue
sclerae, and discoloration of her teeth. Peripheral
blood chromosome analysis was normal. Another, a
mentally retarded boy, had osteoporosis, ligamentous laxity, normal sclerae, and normal teeth. A
third boy, the product of related parents, had
idiopathic osteoporosis in early infancy, but the
sclerae were normal. Urine amino acid chromatogram was normal. Skeletal x-rays at several years of
age showed a marked improvement in bone texture.

One hundred and twenty-seven individuals were
believed to have this syndrome of osseous fragility,
blue sclerae, and presenile deafness or a family
history of presenile deafness. Of 67 cases examined,
56 had a family history of 01. Pedigree analyses in
these cases were consistent with autosomal dominant
inheritance. In 13 pedigrees, complete information
was available on 46 sibships, in which there were 79
with 01 and 62 unaffected. The deviation from the
expected dominant proportion of 50% affected was
not statistically significant. A further 11 cases with
negative family history had clinical and radiographic
findings identical to those of familial cases. Their
disease was believed to have arisen from new
dominant mutation. Sixty cases who were not
examined personally were assigned to this group on
the basis of information obtained from medical
records, x-rays when available, and family history.
The patients personally interviewed were generally
born at term with a mean gestation of 39 weeks
(range 34 to 43 weeks). Clinical findings are summarised in Tables 3, 4, and 5, and Fig. 1. Birthweight
and length centiles plotted against gestational age
showed a normal distribution.
Five patients had not suffered a fracture (age
range from 21 months to 29 years). The majority of
patients had their first fracture in the preschool
period (Table 4). In 5, the first fracture was present
at birth, and in all instances this may have occurred
at delivery. No parent had recognised limb deformity (bowing in the newborn baby), though review
of the x-rays of 3 babies who had fractures at birth
showed mild bowing of the femora. At the time of
assessment, less than one-fifth of all affected individuals had clinical deformity of upper or lower limbs.

Genetic heterogeneity in osteogenesis imperfecta

Deformity of the lower limbs was most common and
usually consisted of anterior or lateral bowing of the
femora or anterior bowing of the tibiae. Angulation
deformities as a result of fracture malunion were
present in some older individuals. Kyphosis and
scoliosis were seen in approximately one-fifth of the
patients. In nearly all cases, clinically recognised
scoliosis was not diagnosed until the end of the first
decade. Scoliosis was progressive during puberty
and several adults had severe curves. In one sibship
with 6 affected individuals, 5 sibs (4 females and 1
male) had mild to moderate scoliosis. One sib
successfully underwent a Dwyer procedure for
stabilisation of her scoliotic curve at 14 years of age.
In another sibship, 2 adult females had severe
kyphoscoliosis. Their brother did not have clinical
kyphoscoliosis and a sister was dead and unavailable
for study. The pattern in these 2 families was similar
to that seen in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis superimposed on osteogenesis imperfecta.
Although only 7 % of affected individuals were less
than the 10th centile in length at the time of birth, by
adult life almost 500% were less than the 3rd centile
in height. Though lower limb and spinal deformity
contributed to some extent to adult short stature,
deformity alone did not account for their postnatal
growth failure. Adults complained of progressive
loss of stature in adult life; This was presumably the
result of progressive platyspondyly and kyphosis
secondary to spinal osteoporosis. Head circumferences were usually large for age and 18 % of
individuals had head circumferences greater than the
98th centile. This feature was clinically striking when
seen against their generally reduced height. The
triangular facial appearance commonly associated
with textbook descriptions of O patients was seen
in 30 % of cases. Temporal bossing and a large head
contributed to this appearance.
A remarkable finding was that 75% of patients
claimed that they or affected children bruised easily.
Many would display bruises at the time of interview
and relate them to trivial trauma.
Hearing impairment was a common finding. Of the
adults, 40 % had severe hearing impairment requiring
hearing aid or surgery for otosclerosis. Overall, 350
of patients had proven or suspected hearing impairment. The observation of hearing loss was usually
noticed first in the third decade, but in 20 % of those
with severe hearing impairment, it was evident before
20 years of age. The earliest onset of appreciable
hearing defect requiring audiometric assessment and
a hearing aid was in a patient 10 years of age.
Virtually all patients were walking independently.
Only 3 patients (2 children and 1 adult) were using a
wheelchair at the time of the study. The adult was
able to walk with crutches and used the wheelchair

105
for convenience. A further 7 patients had a gait
disturbance or limited mobility because of recent or
past injury to legs. No patient at any age was
permanently in hospital or bedridden. No individual
had arm or hand deformity limiting their ability to
feed and clothe themselves. On the whole, families
made light of their personal suffering and handicaps,
but were concerned for their children's future. Where
deafness occurred in families, this was thought to be
by far the greatest handicap.
Frequency
Based on the 1976 census population, the minimum
frequency in Victoria was estimated to be 127/
3 746 000, that is, 3 4/100 000 population. Between
1955 and 1974, inclusive, there were 1 313 101 live
births registered and 46 children were born with this
syndrome. The minimum incidence was thus 3 5/
100 000 or 1/28 500 live births.
Dominant mutation rate
This was calculated directly for the years 1955 to
1974. Based on 10 individuals examined, in whom
examination of the parents reasonably excluded
familial 01, the minimum new dominant mutation
rate was 0-26 x 10-5. Two other individuals
born in the same period, one of whom was adopted
and the other not available for examination, are
likely to represent sporadic cases of this syndrome
and represent new dominant mutation. Therefore,
an upper limit for the direct estimate would be 0 3
x 10-5. The minimum new dominant mutation was
between 0 26 and 0 3 x 10-5
The mean paternal age at the birth of the 10
sporadic cases was 31 * 70 years (SD 81-1 years) with
a range from 20 to 42 years. This can be compared
with the mean age of fathers in Victoria in 1970 of
29-59 years (SD 6-2).
GROUP 2. LETHAL PERINATAL 01 WITH
RADIOGRAPHICALLY CRUMPLED FEMORA
AND BEADED RIBS

Fourteen babies from 12 families, who were born
and died in Victorian hospitals between 1965 and
1977, were ascertained. One family had 2 other
infants, one born in 1964 and the other born in
another state. Neither case was, therefore, primarily
ascertained. Ascertainment of patients through
hospital medical charts and the Consultative Committee on Perinatal Mortality was unreliable for
cases before 1965 for a number of reasons: the
inclusion of 01 cases in other diagnostic categories
was common, diagnostic registers were not as well
kept, and referral of newborns with congenital
abnormalities for necropsy examination and consideration by the Consultative Committee gradually
increased in efficiency between 1961 and 1965.

106
Review of these 16 cases showed that they had
many features in common. In 19 instances they were
born prematurely and 5 were stillborn. The majority
had low birthweight and all had low birth crownheel length. All showed shortening and bowing of
upper and lower limbs. In 7 of 8 cases where the
scleral findings were recorded, the sclerae were noted
to be blue. In 2 cases examined personally, the sclerae
had a deep blue-black hue. Female offspring (12)
were in excess of male offspring (4). Of the 16, 14
had a necropsy and skeletal tissue was preserved for
histopathological examination.
Skeletal x-rays showed crumpled (concertina-like
or accordion-like) femora (Fig. 2), marked angulation of tibiae and sometimes the femora, fractures
and deformity of the shafts of bones of the upper
limbs, platyspondyly, and a beaded appearance of
the ribs (Fig. 3). The skull showed uniformly poor
ossification of the vault and base with thin discontinuous plaques of calcification in the vault.

fragility, blue sclerae, or deafness. This was good
evidence that there was not a dominant gene inherited
by the probands with reduced penetrance in the
parent. However, in 4 pedigrees, there was an
individual in a previous generation with a hearing

births recorded in Victoria. There were 12 infants
with this syndrome born in this period so that the
minimum frequency was 12/749 851, 1/62 487, or an
incidence of 1 6/ 100 000 live births.

Pedigree analysis
Twelve families produced 16 affected sibs. In each of
2 families there were 3 affected sibs with normal
parents (Fig. 4 and 5). In one of these, the parents
were first cousins and had produced 3 stillborn 01
offspring and 3 normal offspring (Fig. 5). The
remaining 10 cases were sporadic.
In the segregation analysis, 3 hypotheses were
considered: that these cases had arisen by autosomal
dominant inheritance, autosomal dominant new
mutation, or autosomal recessive inheritance. None Fig. 3 Lethal perinatal OL X-ray of the chest showing

deficit with onset in the fifth decade or later. In one
pedigree, the maternal great-grandmother of the
proband was reported to have had hearing impairment in the third decade. A possible explanation of
these instances of senile and presenile deafness is
that they may be associated with the heterozygous
state for lethal perinatal 01 genes.
If a new dominant mutation were assumed, then
it would be difficult to correlate the 2 families, each
with 3 affected offspring. It is the authors' opinion
that these familial cases are identical clinically and
radiologically to the 10 sporadic cases. Furthermore,
one might expect an association with increased
paternal age at the birth of these babies, as can be
observed for sporadic cases manifesting disorders
resulting from autosomal dominant mutation. This
clearly was not the case since the mean paternal age
was 28 63 (SD 4 96) years, compared with the mean
paternal age for Victoria for the year 1970 of 29- 59
(SD 6 20).
As we did not have complete ascertainment in
pedigrees, the proband method (Danks et al., 1965;
Emery, 1976) was employed for segregation analysis
of the pedigrees assuming the recessive hypothesis.
The proportion of index cases who were affected
was derived by excluding the proband from analysis
and deriving the segregation ratio from the remaining
members of the pedigree. The numbers of affected
and unaffected in each sibship are presented in
Table 6. The segregation ratio was P = 0 22 (SD
0-07). This estimate is consistent with the recessive
hypothesis.

as well as fragile. Deformity progressed with age and
all adults had severe spinal deformity. Scleral hue
appeared less dense the older the patient (Fig. 1).
Values between 0 and 2 for scleral hue were encountered in some normal children and adults. The
relatively normal sclerae seen in these patients with
severe deformity of the skeleton was in striking
contrast to the findings in group 1 patients.
The majority of individuals were born at term.
The mean gestation was 39 weeks and ranged from
37 to 42 weeks. Clinical data are summarised in
Tables 2, 3, and 4. Birthweights were usually appropriate for gestation. Birth length also was usually in
the normal range, though those babies with marked
deformity and fractures were not measured. However, with increasing age, longitudinal growth
deviated further below the normal centiles, so that
all adults were profoundly dwarfed.
Two babies personally examined had wide anterior
and posterior fontanelles, wide cranial sutures, and
multiple Wormian bones, palpable particularly in
the posterior part of the skull. The triangular facial
appearance and temporal and occipital bossing gave

these patients a markedly similar facies. Head sizes
seemed disproportionately large when judged
against their severe short stature and slender build.
Fractures with deformity of the limbs were
recognised at birth in 14 of 21 patients. The other 7
patients had all had fractures by 15 months of age.
The majority had had multiple fractures involving
long bones and ribs. There appeared to be a marked
reduction in the frequency of fractures beginning
between 5 and 10 years of age. Skeletal deformities,
however, progressed during puberty. Severe kyphoscoliosis and chest deformity were seen in 5 of 6
adult patients. One patient, a male with severe
deformity of the upper limbs, had no clinical or
radiological abnormality of the spine.
Marked ligamentous laxity, particularly in the
metacarpophalangeal joints and interphalangeal
joints, was noted in 50% of patients, all children.
Ligamentous laxity was less marked in adult
patients. The teeth showed transparent dentinogenesis imperfecta in 45 % of the patients. In several
who had received large doses of fluoride, incisor teeth
were white without evidence of translucency and yet
they showed the wear and discoloration in molar
teeth consistent with dentinogenesis imperfecta
(Bixler, 1976).
Easy bruising was related by only 5 of 19 (26 3 %),
in contrast with 75 % of patients in group 1. Of the 6
patients over 14 years of age, hearing defect was
detected in only 1. This 30-year-old woman had
moderately severe progressive hearing loss in the
third decade, and required a hearing aid for normal

conversation.
Of the 17 patients who were over 2 years of age
when studied, 15 (88 %) were markedly handicapped
and had considerable difficulty with walking. A
wheelchair was required by 12, and 3 used a walking
frame for stability. Of 6 adults, 2 had independent
mobility. One drove a car and used crutches and
wheelchair occasionally, and the other used a walking
frame largely to protect herself against body contact
accidents and falling. Straightening of limbs with
intramedullary rodding had been performed in 65 %.
of patients. Two adults had not had any corrective
surgery for deformity. One was severely handicapped
with difficulty in dressing and in moving about in
bed; the other was an independent walker but used
a walking frame.
Radiology
Neonatal x-rays were available for 13 of 21 patients.
In all cases, x-rays were obtained because of fractures
or deformity at birth. The mean number of fractures
at birth was 8, with a range from 0 to 80. Femora and
ribs were the bones most commonly fractured. The
femora varied in appearance; some were normal in

Sillence, Senn, and Danks
appearance, others were short and broad. A few
patients had angulation of the femora but most
showed marked angulation of the tibiae. Some
patients showed multiple fractures of the ribs, but
in no patient was there continuous beading.
Serial x-rays were available on 19 of 21 patients.
Patients with initially short, broad femora showed
this marked thickening of the shafts of the femora
only in the first few years. After 10 years of age,
there was progressive narrowing of the shafts of long
bones, so that in all older patients in this group the
femora appeared characteristically thin.
The metaphysial zone of the lower femur and
upper tibia showed progressive radiological abnormality. The first changes, increasing density and
irregularity in the metaphysial zone, were seen in
patients aged 3 to 5 years. This density increased in
amount during the first decade, so that by 10 years
of age the metaphysial and epiphysial zones were
replaced by whorls of radiodensity. These changes
continued to progress through puberty. X-rays of
the knees of one 25-year-old patient showed replacement of the radiodense appearance at the expanded
ends of the long bone with large radiolucent areas.
This produced a cystic appearance of the ends of
the long bones. The skull x-rays at all ages showed
multiple Wormian bones.

Deaths
Between 1955 and 1975, 8 babies were born with
fractures and deformity of upper and lower limbs,
with clinical and radiographic findings similar to
those of the patients in this group. One infant on
whom the clinical and radiographic findings were
very thoroughly documented has been discussed
with the previous 21 patients. In one case, the x-rays
were unusual in that punctate epiphysial calcification was also present in limbs and spine. These
infants died from cardiac or pulmonary failure, 2 at
birth, 5 during infancy, and 1 at 8 years, 7 months.
Frequency
There were 18 cases living in Victoria in 1976, when
the census population was 3 746 000. Therefore, the
minimum prevalence of this syndrome was 18/
3 746 000, that is, 0-48/100 000 or 1/208 000
persons. Between 1955 and 1976 inclusive, there was
a total of 1 444 716 live births registered in Victoria.
During this 22-year period there were 21 affected
newborns, 13 of whom survived and 8 of whom died.
Therefore, the minimum incidence was 21/1 444 716,
that is, 1 45/100 000 live births or 1 case in 68 800
live births.

Pedigree analysis
All patients in this group were sporadic cases. In 2

Genetic heterogeneity in osteogenesis imperfecta

families the parents were related. In one family, 2
brothers had married 2 sisters who were their first
cousins (Fig. 6). Each couple produced an infant
with multiple neonatal fractures and limb deformity
at birth. In the other family, a marriage between first
cousins had produced 2 children. The second child
had his first fracture at 5 months. Radiographic
findings were consistent with O and were similar to
some other patients in this group. The sclerae were
not particularly blue.
Complete pedigree data were available for 24
families. In 11 families, a parent or other relative had
significant hearing impairment. This was of presenile
onset and in several instances was related to occupational sound trauma. None of these deaf individuals
had had fractures, deformity, or blue sclerae. In one
family, both the father and maternal grandfather
had presenile deafness.
The mean age for the 21 fathers was 32 00 (SD
7 54) years, range 23 to 50 years, compared to the
mean father's age in Victoria for the year 1970 of
29- 59 (SD 6 20) years.

109
One woman with normal sclerae, osteoporosis,
and a history of fractures, congenital dislocation of
the hips, and triangular facial appearance did not
have a family history of osteogenesis imperfecta. It
was not possible to examine her parents and confirm
that they did not have manifestations of 01.

Discussion

The existence of more than one genetic variety of 01
is well accepted (McKusick, 1975). On the other
hand, the hypothesis that all extremes of the
syndrome most probably represent different degrees
of expression of a dominantly inherited single gene
defect (Caniggia et al., 1958; Smars, 1961) is no
longer tenable. The present study suggests that
there are at least four syndromes currently described
as 'osteogenesis imperfecta'. In some previous
studies of 01, the patients described can be separated
into these four types. Moreover, many of the
eponyms for 01 can be related to specific syndromes
when applied in the sense originally employed by
their authors. These will be discussed below.

through an abnormal arrangement of molecules in
the sclerae, probably also contributes, just as the
blueness of the sky results from diffraction of light
in the earth's outer atmosphere. The blueness might
be due to thin sclerae, and evidence exists that in
newborn lethal cases (Follis, 1952; Haebara et al.,
1969; Bluemcke et al., 1972), and non-lethal congenital cases (Buchanan, 1903; Casanovas, 1934),
the sclerae were abnormally thin. On the other hand,
in patients with dominantly inherited 01 with blue
sclerae, the sclerae were reported to be of normal
thickness (Eichholtz, 1971; Eichholtz and Mueller,
1972), but there was an abnormal arrangement of
the collagen molecular framework in the scleral
lamellae accounting for the increased translucency.
GROUP 1. DOMINANTLY INHERITED 01
WITH BLUE SCLERAE
This is also known as Eddowe's syndrome (Eddowes,

1900), Van der Hoeve's syndrome (Van der Hoeve
and de Kleyn, 1918), and Trias Fragilitas Ossium
(Cocchi, 1964). Most cases of 01 tarda levis (Seedorf,
1949), 01 tarda type II (Falvo et al., 1974), and 01
with mild long bone disease (Francis et al., 1975) also
appear to have this variety of 01. The first report was
probably that of Axmann (1831) who described blue
sclerae, osseous fragility, and a tendency to dislocations in himself and his 2 brothers. In contrast, in the
family reported by Ekman (1788), blue sclerae and
deafness were not mentioned, though osseous
fragility with severe deformity was reported in 3
generations. It is possible that this latter family had
one of the syndromes associated with normal sclerae.
Spurway (1896) stressed the occurrence of blue
sclerae in patients with bone fragility, and Van der
Hoeve and de Kleyn (1918) emphasised the association with presenile deafness. Bell (1928) thoroughly
documented the dominant pattern of inheritance of
blue sclerae and osseous fragility. Furthermore, she
stressed that otosclerotic deafness was a common
association. The studies of Seedorf (1949), Komai
et al. (1956), Caniggia et al. (1958), Smars (1961),
and Schr6der (1964) have confirmed the dominant
inheritance seen in this syndrome. Bauze et al. (1975)
showed that a group of patients with mild disease,
blue sclerae, and dominant family history of 01 had
a decreased amount of collagen extractable from the
skin by in vitro chemical procedures. This polymeric
(aggregated or highly cross-linked) collagen (Francis
et al., 1973) reacted like normal collagen in its
stability to depolymerising agents such as pronase and
cold alkali. This was in contrast to their findings in a
group of sporadic cases with normal sclerae and
severe deformity of long bones, in whom there was
a normal amount of polymeric collagen extractable
from the skin, but in whom the extracted collagen

Sillence, Senn, and Danks
showed marked instability when treated with
depolymerising agents.
In the Victorian study and the study by Caniggia
et al. (1958) of 3 large Italian pedigrees, a number of
affected individuals, who on genetic grounds should
have carried the 01 gene, had sclerae of normal
colour. These patients did not have a significant
fracture history or severe deformity. The experience
from these cases suggests that a markedly reduced
expression of blueness of the sclerae may be correlated with absence or marked reduction of the
fracture tendency in patients with this type of
osteogenesis imperfecta. The significance of presenile
arcus corneae, seen in many adult patients, is unknown. A similar observation was made by Smars
(1961).
Hearing impairment is a major burden and is
considered by many patients to be their major
problem. In the Victorian series, 35% of patients
overall had hearing impairment. Among adults, 40 %
had severe hearing impairment necessitating a hearing aid, and many had had one or more ossicular
chain reconstruction operations to improve their
hearing. These findings are comparable to those of
Bell (1928), who found 60% of patients overall in
reported dominant pedigrees, and Smars (1961), who
found 50 % of adult cases in Sweden between 40 and
50 years of age, had hearing impairment. Hearing
impairment can also be a significant problem before
20 years of age, since one-fifth of our patients had
severe hearing loss before the end of the second
decade. The earliest age of onset was 10 years.
Although scoliosis was a common finding, severe
curves were rarely seen. In one case, surgical intervention may have arrested the progression of the
deformity during puberty. Aggressive medical and
surgical management of scoliosis in this syndrome
offers the promise that it will reduce the morbidity
from spinal deformity in future generations.
Similarly, severe long bone deformity was seen
infrequently. Much of that seen in adults could have
been largely preventable with currently available
orthopaedic techniques for fracture reduction and
fixation and for correction of fixed deformity by
multiple osteotomies and intramedullary rodding
(Williams, 1965).
Classical dentinogenesis imperfecta was not
observed in our patients; however, some discoloration, wearing, and chipping of teeth was commonly
found. Levin et al. (1978) have observed that when
a clinical and radiological assessment of the teeth is
made, dominant pedigrees of 01 tarda fall into 2
groups: those families which have hereditary
opalescent dentin, and those which do not. On this
basis they have proposed a classification of families
into 2 types. Our failure to observe dentino-

Genetic heterogeneity in osteogenesis imperfecta

genesis imperfecta in our dominant pedigrees with
blue sclerae may reflect the fact that the families
closely examined fell into the group of those who do
not have dental abnormalities. Alternatively, it may
reflect the fact that clinical assessment may miss those
patients with obliterated pulp cavities and abnormally constricted coronal-radicular junctions, in whom
dentinogenesis imperfecta can be diagnosed radiographically (Bixler, 1976).
The estimate of the minimum frequency of this
syndrome in Victoria, 3-4 per 100000 persons, is
substantially in agreement with that for Japan of
2 35 per 100 000 (Komai et al., 1956). For all cases
(including those with blue sclerae and sporadic cases
with normal sclerae), Smars (1961) estimated a
frequency of 3 to 4 per 100 000 in Sweden, and in
Munster, Germany, Schroder (1964) estimated that
the frequency was 4 7 per 100 000.
The direct estimate of the dominant mutation rate
of 0-3 x 10-5 for the Victorian population is lower
than the estimates of Smars (1961) of 0-7 x 10-a.
However, these latter studies included sporadic
cases of 01, some with normal and others with blue
sclerae. Our estimate, on the other hand, is closer to
the calculated rate for Van der Hoeve's syndrome in
Japan of 0-14 x 10-5 (Komai et al., 1956).

These distinctive radiographic findings were common
to all patients in this group. There were slight
differences in the x-ray (Danks, 1975; Fig. 4) of
a baby from the pedigree with consanguineous
parents and 3 affected sibs (Fig. 5), the bones
appearing thinner than other cases. However,
allowing for the prematurity and macerated state
of the fetus, the appearance was very similar to those
of other babies in the group.
Crumpled femora, beaded ribs, and marked
platyspondyly were not observed in x-rays of 3
babies with neonatal fractures, the offspring of
parents with dominantly inherited 01 associated
with blue sclerae (group 1). Nor were these appearances noted in the newborn x-rays of individuals
with progressive deformity and normal sclerae
(group 3). Though cases of dominant inheritance of
O with congenital presentation have been reported
(Suen et al., 1974), the radiographic features were
quite different.
Pedigrees showing affected sibs with normal
parents, consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, have been reported by Remigio and Grinvalsky (1970), Wilson (1974), and Tsuruta and Sugiura
(1977). Parental consanguinity, resulting in the birth
of one or more affected individuals, has also been
observed by Tsuruta and Sugiura (1977). Taken

at birth. Their estimate included babies with several
varieties of 01. Only 2 cases in their series of 16
were lethal in the perinatal period.
The biochemical findings of a disproportionately
small ratio of type T to type III collagen, produced
by cultured fibroblasts (Penttinen et al., 1975) from
a stillborn baby with 01, reported from Baltimore
(Heller et al., 1975), refer to this variety of 01. This
observation has been substantiated by the finding of
an abnormally decreased proportion of type I to
type m collagen in the skin of 2 lethal congenital
cases of 01 (Francis and Smith, 1975). However, the
clinical and radiological features of these latter
babies were not reported, so the possibility that they
may have had one of the other 01 syndromes with
congenital presentation cannot be ruled out with
certainty. The clinical and radiological features of
the Baltimore case (Heller et al., 1975) were identical
to those of the babies in our experience (R. H. Heller,
1978, personal communication). In one baby in the
Victorian series, there was decapitation during
delivery just as in the Baltimore case. This is not
surprising when one considers the gross deficiency in
the skin collagen seen in babies with this syndrome
(Follis, 1953, case 2).
GROUP 3. PROGRESSIVELY DEFORMING OI
WITH NORMAL SCLERAE

These patients have been variously described as
having 01 congenita (Looser, 1906), OT tarda gravis
(Seedorf, 1949), 01 tarda type I (Falvo et al., 1974),
severe deforming 01 (Bauze et al., 1975), Vrolik's
disease, 01 congenita type Vrolik, periosteal dysplasia of Porak and Durante (Kaplan and Baldino,
1953), and osteopsathyrosis of Lobstein and
Ekman-Lobstein disease. Several previous studies
have drawn attention to the possible significance of
patients with normal sclerae (Cocchi, 1964; Ibsen,
1967; King and Bobechko, 1971; Bauze et al., 1975).
The most striking feature of this group of patients
with normal sclerae is that they all have had progressive deformities of the limbs during childhood
and of the spine during late childhood or adolescence.
The spinal curvature seen in adult patients was
generally of a marked degree. Dentinogenesis
imperfectawas a frequent finding and was particularly
noted in the primary dentition. On the other hand,
hearing impairment occurred infrequently. Dwarfing
among this group of patients was unusually severe,
and scoliosis and limb deformity contributed to the
decreased stature. Moreover, it appears that the
progressive cystic metaphysial and epiphysial
dysplasia seen in many of these patients also
contributed to their short stature.
Neonatal x-rays showed some cases with 'thin'
long bones (Fairbank, 1951), while others had a

Sillence, Senn, and Danks
'thick' bone appearance (Fairbank, 1951). No patient
had broad, crumpled bones identical to those seen in
patients from group 2. Furthermore, cases in group 3
with a 'thick' bone appearance at birth, showed
progressive narrowing of the shafts of the long bones,
so that by the time of puberty the width of the
diaphysis was indistinguishable from other cases
with 'thin' bones at birth. We conclude that the
descriptions 'thick' bone and 'thin' bone 01 have
limited usefulness from the point of view of genetic
classification.
Two newborn cases were observed during the
period of the present study. Their sclerae appeared
blue at birth, and at 3 months of age it was difficult
to distinguish these cases from some patients with
dominantly inherited 01 and blue sclerae (group 1).
By 12 months of age, there seemed to be a distinct
fading of the blueness. Some adults had a faint
blueness of the sclerae, but compared to group 1
patients and a large number of normal adults
examined during the study, the sclerae appeared
relatively normal. We propose, therefore, that these
be called 'normal sclerae' rather than 'white sclerae',
the term which has been used by other authors
(Bauze et al., 1975).
Although all cases in the Victorian study were
sporadic, the evidence suggests that some had autosomal recessive inheritance. There were 2 families in
which the parents were consanguineous, and in one
there were affected individuals born into separate
sibships (Fig. 6). There are a large number of
reports of patients with 01 with features similar to
those in this group, all of which point towards
autosomal recessive inheritance. These include those
of Hein (1928), Kaplan and Baldino (1953),
Rohwedder (1953), Goldfarb and Ford (1954),
Adaita (1957), Lievre (1959, Obs. 23), Awwaad and
Reda (1960), Smars (1961, sibships 94 and 96),
Zeitoun et al. (1963), Maloney (1969), Horan and
Beighton (1975), and Tsuruta and Sugiura (1977).
Parental consanguinity was present in pedigrees
reported by Hein (1928), Kaplan and Baldino (1953),
Rohwedder (1953), Lievre (1959), Zeitoun et al.
(1963), Maloney (1969), and Tsuruta and Sugiura
(1977). The clinical features in these reported patients
varied. There were some with fractures and deformity
at birth with lethal outcome, whereas others had onset
of fractures at birth or infancy and later developed
marked deformity. The sclerae were commonly
reported to be of normal hue in those affected.
It had generally been believed that sporadic cases
with this syndrome represented new dominant
mutations. The data presented here do not exclude
this possibility for some cases. In fact, the family
reported by Holcomb (1931) included several
individuals whose skeletal deformity was of a

Genetic heterogeneity in osteogenesis imperfecta

similar degree to that observed among patients in
the present study. Holcomb's observation that one
of the most severely affected individuals had
relatively normal upper limbs is interesting, in that
this feature was noted in 4 adults in the present
study, who had had fractures but had no deformity
of the upper limbs, in contrast to the marked
deformity in the main weight-bearing bones of their
skeleton, their spine and lower limbs. The remainder
of the patients had progressive deformity of upper
limbs, as well as spine and lower limbs, and these
were the most severely dwarfed, and also had
dentinogenesis imperfecta. It is very likely, then,
that group 3 is genetically heterogeneous and that it
includes cases with both dominantly and recessively
inherited progressively deforming 01 with normal
sclerae.
In Victoria, Australia, this syndrome of osteogenesis imperfecta with progressive deformity and
normalisation of scleral hue with age was approximately one-eighth as common as dominantly
inherited 01 with blue sclerae. However, these
patients were disproportionately represented in
excess in the experience of hospital orthopaedic
units. A report attempting to quantify the frequency
of this syndrome in the population could not be
found. The estimated incidence in our study was
relatively high, 1P45 per 100 000 live births, compared to the frequency in the community of 0 45 per
100 000 population. This must surely be because of
the high mortality both in infancy and childhood
and in the fourth decade (through cardiopulmonary

complications).
The clinical and biochemical studies of Bauze et
al. (1975) and Francis et al. (1975) support the
existence of a separate syndrome or syndromes of O,
in which patients have normal sclerae and severe
deformity. Those patients studied by them had
polymeric skin collagen which was abnormally
unstable in depolymerising agents. It seems likely
that this reflects a defect in collagen cross-linking
(Francis et al., 1973). Such a defect could explain
many of the clinical signs in these patients, such as
the bone fragility and joint hyperlaxibility.
GROUP 4. DOMINANTLY INHERITED 01
WITH NORMAL SCLERAE

This syndrome probably includes some cases
previously described as Ekman-Lobstein disease or
osteopsathyrosis idiopathica of Lobstein. Only 2
families were identified in the Victorian study. The
family reported by Holcomb (1931) with osseous
fragility but normal sclerae included affected individuals in 5 generations. In the third generation of the
family, a woman aged 55 years had no recorded
fractures, but was small and badly deformed. Further-

113
more, a skipped generation was recorded in this
pedigree.
The family reported by Omenn et al. (1977, Case 3,
page 226) documented 9 affected individuals in 4
generations with 01 associated with normal hearing
and white sclerae. An infant was born to an 18-yearold affected mother following intrauterine diagnosis
of 01 at 37 weeks' gestation. The infant suffered his
first fracture at 7 days of age and had a total of 4
spontaneous fractures in the first 3 years of life.
In an extensive account of the family reported by
Ekman (Seedorf, 1949), there is no mention of blue
sclerae or deafness. Furthermore, Lobstein (1835) in
his description of idiopathic osteopsathyrosis did not
stress an association between bone fragility and blue
sclerae or deafness. Cocchi (1964), in fact, considers
that Ekman-Lobstein disease is a distinct syndrome
characterised by a liability to fractures without other
symptoms.
Lievre (1959, Obs. 25) reported osseous fragility
with normal sclerae in 3 generations of a French
family. Other families with normal sclerae and bone
fragility, both with or without progressive deformity
of long bones and spine, have been observed in
North America (Levin and Thompson, 1975; J. Hall,
1978, personal communication). It is likely that this
syndrome is more common than the few published
reports would lead us to believe.
It could be argued that these individuals have a
genetic defect identical to that of cases with blue
sclerae, bone fragility, and presenile deafness. If so,
the absence of blue sclerae could be explained by
failure of penetrance of that feature. However, the
presence of individuals with bone fragility in several
generations without blue sclerae is the strongest
argument against this supposition. Furthermore, our
current concept of this group of connective tissue
disorders is that the manifestations result from a
wide-spread connective tissue defect, and one would
expect that individuals with the most severe bone
disease would have the most markedly blue sclerae.
However, in those families with dominant inheritance
of bone fragility and normal sclerae there does not
appear to be an increase in blueness of the sclerae
with increasing severity.
Why presenile deafness has not been a reported
feature is not clear. It most likely reflects our limited
experience with description of these patients as a
separate syndrome. On the other hand, it may
indicate that the pathological process in the middle
ear does not involve an overabundant callus formation with ossicular chain fixation, as occurs in group
1 patients. Experience suggests that dentinogenesis
imperfecta, on the other hand, is a feature of most
or all group 4 patients, but only of some pedigrees of
group 1 patients.

An alternative descriptive nomenclature based on cases with normal sclerae and severe progressive

Genetic heterogeneity in osteogenesis imperfecta
The heterogeneity which we have observed
demands a critical reassessment of current objectives
and methodology in prenatal diagnosis of O0
(Solomons and Armstrong, 1976). There is a high
probability that patients with dominantly inherited
01 and blue sclerae are not at risk for producing an
infant who will die in the newborn period with lethal
perinatal 01.
