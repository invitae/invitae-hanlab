Germline mutations in the RB1 gene confer hereditary predisposition to retinoblastoma. We have performed
a mutation survey of the RB1 gene in 232 patients with hereditary or non hereditary retinoblastoma. We
systematically explored all 27 exons and flanking sequences as well as the promotor. All types of point
mutations are represented and are found unequally distributed along the RB1 gene sequence. In the population
we studied, exons 3, 8, 18 and 19 are preferentially altered. The range of frequency of detection of germline
mutations is about 20%, indicating that other mechanisms of inactivation of RB1 should be involved. The
spectrum of mutations presented here should help to improve the clinical management of retinoblastoma and
to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to tumorigenesis.

INTRODUCTION
Retinoblastoma, an intraocular tumor occurring almost exclusively in young children, is a paradigm for studies of the role
of tumor suppressor genes in cancer predisposition. It occurs
in both hereditary and non hereditary forms (1). Inactivation
of both alleles of the retinoblastoma gene (RBI) is required
for the development of the tumor. Approximately 40% of
retinoblastomas are hereditary, due to a germinal mutation
transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with a high but
incomplete penetrance of 90% (2). The second mutation is
somatically acquired and arises in the retina cells. In the non
hereditary form, the two mutations are somatic. In familial
cases, which represent about 10% of retinoblastoma, the
segregation of the disease causing gene can be followed
indirectly by linkage with polymorphic DNA markers (3,4).
However, the majority of hereditary retinoblastomas results
from de novo mutations, as sporadic forms in families without
history of retinoblastoma. In this latter case the affected allele
must be identified by direct characterization of the causative
molecular event.
Loss of function of the RBI gene is associated not only
with retinoblastoma but also with a variety of tumors such as
osteosarcomas, small cell lung carcinomas, bladder tumors or
breast carcinomas (5-8). The RBI gene is over 180 kb long
and contains 27 exons grouped in three domains, separated by
two large introns (9-10). It encodes a protein, pRB, playing a
role in the regulation of the cell division cycle (11) through

*To whom correspondence should be addressed

negative regulation of Gl/S progression (12).The phosphorylation status of pRB is cell cycle dependant. It is also known to
interact with oncoproteins such as SV40 large T antigen,
adenovirus E1A and papilloma virus E7 (13-15). In addition,
it has been recently shown that pRB and another tumor
suppressor gene product, p53, interact to regulate the cell
cycle (16).
Attempts to define the mutations resulting in the inactivation
of the RB1 gene have led to the characterization of different
types of alterations. Constitutional cytogenetic rearrangements
and large sized molecular deletions account for about 15% of
retinoblastomas (17,18). A number of germline and somatic
mutations of the RB 1 gene in hereditary and non hereditary
retinoblastomas as well as in osteosarcomas, small cell lung
carcinomas, bladder tumors and breast carcinomas have been
reported (19-24).
To delineate more precisely the spectrum of germline RBI
mutations, we have investigated a large series of patients with
hereditary and non hereditary retinoblastoma. We report 31
new mutations and three polymorphisms in the RBI gene.
Taking also into account the 13 germline mutations detected
in 22 previously reported patients (24,25) we discuss the
spectrum of nucleotide changes detected in all 27 exons and
promoter of the RB 1 gene in our series of 232 patients with
sporadic and hereditary retinoblastoma. The identification of
germline RBI gene mutations should greatly improve the

RESULTS
All 27 exons of the RBI gene as well as at least 100
bp corresponding to intronic sequences on each side were
investigated for nucleotide changes in the DNA of all tested
patients. The promotor region spanning nucleotides —588 to
-134 and encompassing a Spl site, TATA-like and CCAATlike sequences, and a stem and loop structure was also
analysed. The 31 new germline nucleotide changes and the
polymorphisms we report share out between the following
groups:

In frame and missense mutations
We detected in exon 18 a TTT deletion at position 568 resulting
in the loss of a leucine amino acid. Four missense mutations
were observed in exons 6 (ILE185THR), 19 (ALA635PRO),
and 20 (VAL654GLU and GLN685PRO). Parental DNA analysis did not reveal the same mutation, thus indicating that
mutations ILE1 85THR and GLN685PRO arised de novo in
these patients.
Consensus splice junction sequence nucleotide changes
A single splice site mutation (G to A transition) occurring at
position — 1 of intron 5 was identified.
Intronic nucleotide changes
Our study included at least 100 bp of flanking intronic
sequences on both sides of the exons and this enabled us to
identify several nucleotide changes that cannot be considered
as part of the consensus splice site. Two were located in intron
3 at position +12 (T to C transition) and +45 (C to T
transition). An A to C transversion was identified in intron 8
at position —27, and in intron 11 at position +41; these
alterations were also found in the non affected mothers of
these patients. Another A to C transversion was detected in
intron 10 at position - 5 7 of another patient whose parents
and sister did not show the same event. These three cases
were the only ones where parents' DNA was available for
study. We could also identify an A to G transition in intron
13 at position - 2 9 and a 4 bp duplication of the tetranucleotide
GAAG in intron 26 at position +J88.

Polymorphisms
We detected three new polymorphisms in addition to those
already identified (4,26). One occurred at codon 661 (arginine)
in exon 20, and consisted in a C to A transversion; the observed
frequency was 95% for allele C and 5% for allele T. Another
one occurred in intron 2, at position +76 and resulted from a
C to T transition; the observed frequency was 85% for allele
C and 15% for allele T. The third one was observed in intron
3, at position +37 and was the result of a A to G transition;
the observed frequency was 95% for allele A and 5% for
allele G.
All these mutations, as well as the 13 mutations already
published by our group, resulting from the exploration of the
series of 232 patients DNA are reported in Table 1.

DISCUSSION
In this paper we report novel germline mutations in the
retinoblastoma gene of hereditary and non hereditary RB
patients. We have characterized in 32 affected individuals 31
germline mutations located in exons 3, 6, 9, 11, 13, 15,
18-20 and 23. Three novel polymorphisms were also identified.
We discuss the spectrum of mutations, including the 13
mutations we previously reported, in all 27 exons and promotor
region of the RBI gene in a series of 232 patients. On the

Frameshift and nonsense mutations
We characterized in 15 unrelated patients 14 frameshift
mutations in exons 3, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18-20 and 23. Ten of
them were deletions: three were deletions of 1 bp in exons
13, 19 and 23, four were deletions of 2 bp in exons 3, 11 and
19. The remaining deletions consisted in a 5 bp deletion in
exon 19, a 7 bp deletion in exon 23, and a 30 bp deletion in
exon 15. Two other frameshift mutations resulted from 1 or 2
bp insertions in exons 3 and 23, respectively. A 5 bp duplication
in exon 19 and another one of 16 bp in exon 9 were also
characterized. All these frameshift mutations lead to a stop
codon, either in the containing mutation exon, or in the
following exon. Four nonsense mutations were detected,
respectively, in exon 3 (codon 98), in exon 11 (codon 358),in
exon 15 (codon 467), and in exon 18 (codon 581). Two of
them consisted in a C to T transition at a CG dimer of an
arginine codon.

whole, this screening revealed 44 germline mutations among
which 31 were found in the coding region, four in the
exon—intron junction, and nine being nucleotide changes in
the intronic sequence.
Nature of the germline mutations
Overall, frameshift mutations constitute the largest group of
detected nucleotide changes (19/44) in the RBI gene. Fourteen
were deletions of 1 to 30 bp, three were 1 or 2 bp insertions
and two were duplications of 5 or 16 bp and all resulted in
stop codons. Seven nonsense mutations were detected in 14
patients and five of them were the result of a C to T transversion
in CGA arginine codons. The two remaining nonsense
mutations involved a tryptophan codon in exon 3, and a
glutamic acid codon in exon 18. These 26 different frameshift
and nonsense mutations should all result in a truncated protein.
Five different missense mutations were characterized in the
series of patients. Two of them located in exons 19 and 20,
which are part of the DNA binding domain, change a residue
in a proline amino acid. The prediction of the secondary
structure using the Gamier algorythm shows that these two
residues fall into alpha helices. The change into proline might
therefore severely affect the conformation of the mutant protein
and result in a lack of fixation of pRB to DNA and in a loss
of the tumor suppressor function. Two other residues in exons
6 and 20 are changed from hydrophobic to hydrophilic amino
acids, and from hydrophobic to hydrophilic charged. Again,
these changes might disturb the protein folding because hydrophobic residues are usually buried inside the protein, whereas
hydrophilic residues are preferentially exposed to solvent.
However it is difficult to predict the physiological and functional impact the missense and single inframe mutations will
provoke, since the tridimensional structure of the protein is
not known.

Four splicing mutations were detected in the intron donor
or acceptor site. Although RNA expression experiments have
not been performed until now, it is most probable that these
nucleotide changes disturb the splicing process of the gene
because they occur within the first 3 bp of the consensus
splice site.
Finally, eight substitutions and a 4 bp duplication were
detected in intronic sequences. These alterations were not
found in the control population and were identified only once
among the 232 unrelated RB patients. None of these nucleotide
changes generate a novel splicing site and there exists no
cosegregation of these variations with any mutant allele. The
biological significance of those variants is not known and
should be explored through expression assays. Nevertheless,
they represent 20% (9/44) of all the nucleotide changes detected
during this screening. For two of them (RB211, RB318), for
which the family could be studied, the apparently healthy
mothers presented the same variation. In this particular case
and, in general, in all intronic alterations the oncogenic nature
of these nucleotide changes should be assessed by the study
of the tumor DNA when available.
It is also worth noticing that, in the course of this exploration
of germline DNA, only one of the two alleles was found
mutated, that not more than one mutation could be detected
on a single allele in all tested patients, and that none of the
serine or threonine residues—where phosphorylation occurs—
were mutated. As previously reported by us and others
(22,24,25), the majority of the deletions we characterized were
flanked by short, direct repeats, whereas point mutations
create a DNA sequence which is homologous with a normal
endogeneous sequence located nearby the mutation.
Distribution of the germline mutations

another hypothesis is that a gene distinct from RBI is involved
in retinoblastoma development.
Table 2 compares the mutation frequencies of detection
according to the clinical presentation. According to Vogel's
review (1), 10-12% of unilateral sporadic cases are carriers
of a germline mutation. Our results are consistent with this
estimation because we could identify the mutation in 12.5%
of the cases. They are more in agreement with Vogel's
estimation than Draper's one which defines this proportion to
be 2% (31). The familial and bilateral sporadic cases are
considered to be carriers of a germline mutation and should
fall into the same range of detection mutation frequency. Our
data show that almost twice as many mutations are detected
in the familial form than in the bilateral sporadic form of the
disease. This difference is strengthened by a y} value of 5.57.
The question is therefore raised of the heredity of all the
bilateral cases as postulated in Knudson's model and may have
to be related to environmental influence or epigenetics events.
Further studies of larger populations should help answering

in the retinoblastoma gene are not equally spread along its
sequence: 13 out of the 27 exons representing 36% of the
2813 bp of the coding region (exons 1, 5, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17,
21, 22 and 24-27) as well as the promotor are free from
alterations. It is noteworthy that eight of these exons are part
of the domain interacting with the oncoproteins. In this series
of 232 patients, exons 3, 8, 18, 19 and their flanking intronic
sequences are found prefentially altered. Four mutations are
located in exon 3 and three in its flanking sequences. All the
mutations in the coding sequence of this exon are stop codons
and thus produce a very short non functional truncated protein.
Exon 18 and its surrounding sequences show six nucleotide
changes: four are unique, two are found two and three times
in unrelated patients, respectively. Four mutations were found
in exon 19, among which one is present in two unrelated
patients. The two latter exons are part of the known interaction
domains of the protein whereas exon 3 is not known to have
a functional role. Strikingly, one unique nonsense mutation
was found in exon 8 in seven unrelated patients. This mutation
truncates the protein in a region which is not involved in any
of the pRB interaction domains.
In this screening, potentially oncogenic mutations were
detected in about one sixth of the cases (35 exonic and splicing
mutations/232 patients). If we also consider cytogenetic
rearrangements and alterations detectable by Southern blotting
usually found in 10% of the cases, the frequency of detection
of a RBI rearrangement is obviously far from 100%, even in
families in which the disease segregates with RBI polymorphisms and as it could be expected in transmissible dominant
forms. Several hypotheses could be advanced to explain this
low number of mutations within the RBI gene itself. Causative
mutations could be located outside the screened region, i.e. in
the two largest introns (respectively 30 and 70 kb) which could
include regulatory sequences or be implicated in recombination
mechanisms as described for the factor VIII gene (27). Regulatory sequences could also be present in the promotor region
much further upstream of the coding sequence and therefore
not yet accurately delineated. Some mutations could be found
in the 3' untranslated region which is 1800 bp long and which
could play a role in the tumor suppressor activity as already
reported in other genes (28). Other mechanisms of inactivation
of the RBI gene could also be invoked such as hypermethylation of the 5' GC rich part of the gene (29,30). Finally,

the question. Interestingly, a recent study by Bonaiti et al. (32)
based on a statistical approach of 1800 nephroblastomas
suggests that some sporadic bilateral forms of the disease
could be non hereditary.
Correlations between the phenotypic expression of retinoblastoma disease and molecular alterations found in the RBI
gene are difficult to draw up at least for the missense and
inframe mutations. In general, we could not relate the mutation
type or position along the gene and the gravity of the
disease. However, we could observe that some patients carrying
mutations in exon 19 have also developed non ocular tumors
(pinealoblastoma, fibrosarcoma or osteosarcoma). The data
presented here used in further investigations, such as expression
assays, should contribute to a greater understanding of the
mechanisms leading to oncogenesis and tumor suppressor
function of the RB1 gene product.

Subjects and DNA samples
A total of 232 unrelated patients were referred from ophthalmology clinics or
pediatric oncologic units, mainly the Institut Curie. Our series includes 25
familial and 151 sporadic bilateral or multifocal unilateral retinoblastoma
cases. The remaining 56 cases were patients with unilateral form considered
as monofocal. For each patient DNA we tested, karyotypes and Southern
blotting were performed to exclude any gross rearrangements.
DNA was isolated from blood samples anticoagulated with EDTA, as
already described (18). Thirty control DNA from unrelated individuals were
added to the pool of patients and subjected to the same exploration.
Oligonucleotides
Primers for DNA amplification were selected from the human retinoblastoma
gene sequence (33,34). Oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed to amplify
fragments containing each of the RB 1 gene exons as well as 450 bp of the
promotor region. They were selected in intronic sequences, at least a 100 bp
upstream or downstream of the exons boundaries. Primers sequences are given
in Table 3.
DNA amplification
PCR amplification was performed as previously described (35) with some
modifications. Briefly, genomic DNA (1 ng) was amplified in a 100 \\\ reaction
mixture containing 50 mM KC1, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.4), 2 mM MgCl2> 0.01%
(wt/vol) gelatin, 200 mM of each dNTP, 20 pM of each primer, and 2.5 U
Taq polymerase (Cetus). For SSCP analysis 1 p.Ci of 33P alpha-dCTP (3000Ci/
mmol; NEN) was added to the reaction and the cold dCTP concentration was
reduced to 0.02 mM. Amplification conditions consisted of 35 cycles of
denaturing at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 52-62°C for 1 min, and extension
at 72°C for 1.5 min. The reaction was initiated by 10 min incubation at 94°C
and ended with 7 min incubation at 72°C. To enhance heteroduplexes
formation, the PCR cycles were followed by a 10 min denaturing step at 94°C
and a 1 h annealing step at relevant temperatures.
DNA analysis
Analysis by means of DGGE of the amplified products was performed
according to the previously described protocol (24). Briefly, 15 nl of each
amplified DNA sample were loaded onto a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel containing
a linear increasing denaturant gradient parallel to the direction of migration
and electrophoresed at constant 60°C temperature in TAE 1 Xbuffer (50XTAE:
2 mM Tris, 1 M NaAc, 50 mM EDTA pH 7.4). Stock solutions consisting of
6% acrylamide in TAE buffer (0% denaturant) and 40% formamide, 7 M
urea, 6% acrylamide in TAE buffer (100% denaturant) were combined to
obtain the intended denaturing gradient range. Gels were then stained with
ethidium bromide and photographed. When performing SSCP analysis, 20 \l\
of the PCR product were digested overnight with 10 U of the appropriate
restriction enzyme. Four microliters of the digested PCR product were mixed
with 6 |il 95% formamide, 20 mM NaOH, 0.05% bromophenol blue and
0.05% xylene cyanol. The sample was heated to 100°C for 10 min and
immediately cooled in ice for 10 min. Samples were loaded onto a 0.03X38X40
cm hydrolink (MDETM, Bioprobe) gel and electrophoresed in TBE 1X(O.O9
M Tris, 0.09 M boric acid and 2.5 mM EDTA) at room temperature. Gels

Sequence analysis
The nucleotide sequence of DNA samples showing an altered electrophoretic
behavior was determined by direct sequencing as already described (24).
