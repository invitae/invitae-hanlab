Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)is
a heterogeneous syndrome, due to X-linked
and autosomal recessive defects. A significant proportion of the autosomal recessive
forms of SCID are due to mutations at the
adenosine deaminase (ADA) locus. Nine different mutations at the ADA locus, including 7
missense point mutations, have been reported
in children with ADA - SCID. We couId detect
5 of the 7 missense mutations associated with
ADA - SCIDby alterationsin restriction fragments utilizing standard restriction digestion
of genomic DNA and hybridization of radiolabelled ADA genomic probes to Southern
transfers. We additionally developed more
rapid nonradioactive methods employing digestion of genomic DNA amplified by PCR
that also detected all 5 mutations. Using these
methods, we have examined a sample of 45
ADA- SCID chromosomes and report that
these 5 missense mutations account for one
third of the ADA- chromosomes studied,
with 2 mutations being relatively common.

infections with pathogenic and nonpathogenic fungal,
viral, and bacterial microorganisms. The syndrome of
SCID is heterogeneous, with approximately half due to
an X-linked defect and the remainder to autosomal recessive defects [reviewed in Hirschhorn and Hirschhorn,
19901. A significant proportion of the autosomal recessive forms of SCID are due to mutations at the adenosine
deaminase (ADA)locus [Hirschhorn et al., 19791.Mutations at the ADA locus can result in a spectrum of phenotypes: from the rapidly fatal early onset of classical
ADA- SCID to the apparently normal immune function of “partial” ADA deficiency [Giblett et al., 1972;
reviewed in Kredich and Hershfield, 1989; Hirschhorn,
19901. The nucleotide sequence of both the mRNA and
the structural gene for ADA have been determined
[Daddona et al., 1984;Valerio et al., 1984a, 1985;Wiginton et al., 1984,19861.Nine different mutations, including 7 missense point mutations, a point mutation resulting in abnormal splicing of mRNA, and a deletion, have
been reported in children with ADA- SCID (Table I)
[Bonthronet al., 1985;Valerio et al., 1986;Akesonet al.,
1987, 1988; Markert et al., 1988, 1989; Hirschhorn et
al., 1990, 1991; Berkvens et al., 19901. We have also
identified 6 additional missense mutations at the ADA
locus that result in “partial” ADA deficiency (absence of
ADA in erythrocytes but retention of variable residual
enzyme activity in other cell types) [Hirschhorn et al.,
1989,19901.These latter mutations appear to be associated with normal immune function, and several can be
identified by detection of abnormal DNA restriction
fragments.
Computer analysis of restriction maps of the ADA
gene [Wiginton et al., 19861 indicated that 5 of the 7
missense mutations associated with ADA - SCID
should be detectable by alterations in restriction fragments. To demonstrate that all 5 mutations could be
identified by altered restriction fragments, we initially
utilized standard hybridization of radiolabelled ADA
genomic probes to Southern transfers of restriction-digested genomic DNA and then developed more rapid
nonradioactive methods employing digestion of genomic

tested a sample of 45 ADA - chromosomes for the presence of these 5 missense mutations and report that the 5
mutations account for one third of the ADA - chromosomes studied, with 2 mutations being relatively common.

METHODS AND PATIENTS
General Methods
DNA was isolated, digested with restriction endonucleases, electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose gels, and
transferred to nitrocellulose and filters hybridized with
32P randomly labelled DNA probes by standard
methods, as previously described [Maniatis et al., 1982;
Southern, 1975; Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1984; Tzall et
al., 19891. Isolation of the genomic DNA probes and
determination of RFLPs was performed as previously
described [Tzall e t al., 19891.All base pair (bp) numbers
of genomic DNA refer to numbering in Wiginton et al.
(1986). Numbering of the cDNA begins with 1 = A of the
initiation ATG.
Amplification of Genomic DNA by Polymerase
Chain Reaction
Genomic DNA (0.5 kg) was amplified by Taq polymerase in a total volume of 50 kl, essentially as described by Saiki et al. (1988). The reaction mixture was
heated at 94°C for 4 min prior to the addition of 0.5 p1 of
Taq polymerase (Cetus-Perkin Elmer) and overlaying
with mineral oil. The DNA was amplified in a thermocycler for 30 cycles of 72°C for 5 min and 94°C for 1min
20 sec with a final extension of 10 min a t 72°C. Three
sets of primers were used to amplify, respectively, exon
4, exons 7-9, or exons 10 and 11. These were a sense
primer in IVS 3 extending from bp 24870 to 24904 and
a n antisense primer in IVS 4 extending from bp 25595 to
25624 (5' ATGAAGTGGGTTTAATCTGCCAAGGGTTGGGGATG and 5' TGCTAAGCTTGGGCCTGCCATGATGTTCAC); a sense primer in IVS 6 extending
from bp 28376 to 28405 and a n antisense primer in IVS 9
extending from bp 29086 to 29115 (5' ATGCTGTTGAAGCAGGCAGCATGACTAGGA and 5' TGCCTGCTTCCCAGGGTGTCGAAGAGATTT); a sense
primer in IVS 9 extending from bp 30319 to 30348 and

a n antisense primer in IVS 11extending from bp 31311
to 31340 (5' AGGCTGCTGTGAGGATCAAAGGCGGGTGAA and 5' TGCTAGAAGTCCCACAGAAAGCCACACTGG). Ten microliters of the reaction product
were incubated with the appropriate restriction enzyme
(usually overnight) according to the manufacturer's instructions in a total volume of 25 k1, electrophoresed in
1.2% or 2.0% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide,
and the bands were visualized under UV light.

Individuals Studied
EBV immortalized lymphoid line cells and/or
fibroblast cell lines from 22 unrelated ADA - deficient
SCIDs and a mother of a n additional proband were studied. From the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Mutant Repository (Camden NJ), GM 0469, 1390, 1715, 2436,
2471,2578,2606,2756,2825A3,
3136,3137,4258A, and
11411 were studied. From the Repository for Mutant
Human Cell Strains, Quebec, Canada, WG 548 and 290
were studied. CR, DM, TM, CJ, Mother RQ, Te, Fx, and
Fa were, respectively, patients of Dr. W. Borkowsky and
R. Hirschhorn (CR), Dr. D. Kirkpatrick (DM), Dr. F. S.
%sen (TM), Dr. M. Ballow (CJ and Ro), Dr. A. Heywood
(TE), Drs A. Martin and R. Hong (FX), and Dr. J . Jung
(FA). There was no known consanguinity in any of the
families studied and therefore potentially 45 independent chromosomes were studied. However, 2 patients
(DM and GM 114111) came from population isolates and
were each homozygous €or a mutation (see results).
RESULTS
An Abnormal RsaI Restriction Fragment Detects
the GS3' to A Mutation (Arg'll-His) in 2/45 ADA Chromosomes
A G-to-A transition a t base pair (bp) 632 of the cDNA,
resulting in replacement of arginine by a histidine residue at codon 211, has been reported by Wkeson et al.
[1987,19881 in 2 ADA - SCIDs: GM 2756 [Rubinstein et
al., 1979; Hirschhorn et al., 1980bl and GM 2606 [Cohen
et al., 1976; Hopp et al., 1985; Hershfield et al., 19871
(Table I). The nucleotide substitution predicts the loss of
a site for the restriction enzyme RsaI in exon 7 of genomic DNA and the appearance of a larger than normal
fragment (Table I and Fig. 1). When we digested DNA

Fig. 1. The Arg'l-to-His mutation in exon 7 can be detected as the
loss of a site for RsaI. DNA was digested with RsaI, electrophoresed,
transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized with a radiolabeled
BalIIBglII genomic probe extending from IVS 7 (28579) to IVS 8
(28915).The normalRsa1 sites are at bp 27277 in exon 6,28517 in exon
7, and 31771 in IVS 11, predicting a 3.154-kbband that hybridizes with
the probe (and a 1.240-kbband not detected by the probe used). Loss of
the site in exon 7 predicts a larger than normal 4.394-kb band. Two
patients are heterozygous for the mutation (lanes 2 and 4) Lane 1 = GM

representing 45 ADA - chromosomes (22 patients and a
parent of an additional patient), only the 2 previously
reported patients carried this mutation on one of their
chromosomes.
We could also identify the mutation in the 2 ADA chromosomes by amplifying exons 7-9 from genomic
DNA, using PCR- and ADA-specific primers, digesting
the DNA with R s d followed by electrophoresis in
agarose, and visualization of the bands by staining with
ethidium bromide (see Fig. 4C).
An Abnormal MspI or XmaI Restriction
Fragment Identifies the Ts" to G Mutation
(Leu'"-Arg) in 1/45 ADA - Chromosomes
A Tgll-to-G transversion, predicting a leucine304to
arginine substitution, has been reported by Valerio et al.
119861 in an ADA- SCID, GM 2471 [Hirschhorn et al.,
1975, Polmar et al., 19761. The nucleotide substitution
generates a new site for MspI in exon 10of genomic DNA
and the appearance of a smaller than normal fragment
(Fig. 2). Since the next 3' site for MspI in IVS 10 of
genomic DNA is polymorphic [Tzall et al., 19891, the
mutant MspI site could either cut a normal 0.47-kb
fragment to 0.34 kb, ifthe mutation occurs on a chromosomes with the most common RFLP (0.47 + 1.8kb) (Fig.
21, or a normal 2.30-kb fragment to 1.96 kb, if the mutation occurs on a chromosome bearing the rarer RFLP

Fig. 2. The Le~~~*-to-Argmutation
in exon 10 can be detected by the
gain of a site for MspI. DNA was digested with MspI, electrophoresed,
transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized with a radiolabelled
Hind1 ADA genomic probe containing exon 10 (bp 29910-30713). In
normals, the probe detects an invariant 0.697-kb fragment and, as a
result of apolymorphicMsp1 site in IVS 10 (bp 306141, either 0.470- and
1.834-kb fragments (common homozygote), a 2.304-kb fragment (rare
homozygote), or all three bands (heterozygote). The mutation introduces a new MspI site in exon 10 (bp 30484 ofgenomic DNA). Lane 1 =:
GM 2471. This patient, in addition to bearing the Leu304-to-Argmutation, which creates a new site for MspI in exon 10 (bp 30484 of genomic
DNA), is heterozygous for the RFLP at the MspI site in IVS 10 (2.3D.H
+ 0.47 kb fragments). The mutation occurred on the chromosome
bearing the 1.8 + 0.47 RFLP, and therefore the 0.47-kb fragment is
replaced by a 0.34 kb band. Lane 2 = normal homozygous for the
commonMspIRFLP inIVS 10 (1.8 + 0.47/1.8 + 0.47); lane3 = normal
heterozygous for the RFLP (2.3/1.8 + 0.47).

(2.3 kb; not seen). An abnormal 0.34-kb fragment was
seen in GM 2471 (Fig. 21, but no other child exhibited
either of these changes.
This mutation also generates a new site for XmaI in
exon 10 of genomic DNA and could therefore be identified more simply by digestion of PCR-amplified genomic
DNA with XmaI. There are no normal sites for XmaI in
the 1.021-kb fragment amplified (exons 10 and l l ) , and
the mutation could be easily detected by the appearance
of 165- and 856-bp fragments (Fig. 4E).

[Rubenstein et al., 1979; Hirschhorn et al., 19801. The
mutation creates a new site for the restriction enzyme
BaZI in exon 11of genomic DNA and therefore the appearance of a smaller than normal restriction fragment
(Fig. 3). Digestion patients' DNA with BaZI and hybridization with a genomic probe revealed that one additional patient (DM)was homozygous,and two additional
patients, GM 4258 [Dyminski et al., 19791and Te, were
heterozygous for the mutation (Fig. 3). Thus this mutation was found in 6/45 chromosomes from 5 of the patients studied (Table 11).
The Ala329-to-Valmutation was easily identifiable by
PCR amplification of exons 10 and 11, and digestion
with BaZI, since there are no normal sites for BaZI in the
amplified region. We could confirm the presence of the
mutation on all 6 ADA- chromosomes (Fig. 4F).

Mutations (Leul"-Pro and Gly216-Arg)by

Enzyme Digestion and Electrophoresis in
Agarose Gels
We also developed nonradioactive methods for the detection of 2 additional missense mutations we have previously identified and shown to be detectable by abnormal restriction fragments using conventional Southern
blots and hybridization with radiolabelled probes. These
latter 2 mutations are a Ledo7-Promutation in exon 4,
detected by the simultaneous gain of a site for MspI and
the loss of a site for BaZI [Hirschhorn et al., 19901and a
Gly216-Argmutation in exon 7, detected by gain of a site
for BstXI (Table I) [Hirschhorn et al., 19911. We could

ADA genomic probe extending from bp 29910 to 30713 and containing
exon 10 (see Methods). The normal BalI sites are at bp 29324 in IVS 9

mutation generates a new BalI site at bp 31177 of genomic DNA,
predicting a smaller than normal 1.853-kb band. One patient is homozygous for the mutation (lane 91, while 4 patients are heterozygous
(lanes 1 , 5 , 6 , and Te, not shown). Lane 1 = GM 4258A; lane 2 = CR;

Fig. 4. Detection of five missense mutations by restriction digestion of PCR-amplified genomic DNA. Oligonucleotide primers (see Methods)
were used to amplify the area of genomic DNA containing the mutation (exon 4, exons 7-9, or exons 10 and 11).Amplified DNA was digested with
the indicated restriction enzyme and electrophoresed in 1.2-2.0% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide, as described in Methods. Figures are
arranged in the order of exons involved. Mutant bands are indicated by *. Numbers refer to the base pair of genomic DNA according to Wiginton et
al. [1986].A, B: Detection ofthe exon 4 Le~'~'-Promutation by gain of a site for MspI and simultaneous loss of a site forBal1 The primers amplify a
754-bpfragment extending from IVS 3 (bp 24870) to IVS 4 (bp 25624). A: Gain of a site for MspI: There is one normal site for MspI (bp 24973 in exon
4) in the 754-bp amplified fragment, predicting 110-and 645-bp fragments. The mutation generates a new MspI site at bp 25074 in the 645-bp
fragment, predicting the appearance of 550- and 95-bp fragments (the 95-bp fragment comigrates with the normal 110-bp fragment). The MspI
digestion also detects a n Arg76-Trpmutation due to a CZZ6-to-T
transition, seen only in partially ADA-deficient children [Hirschhorn et al., 19901.
The Arg76-Trpmutation abolishes the normal site for MspI (bp 24973 of genomic DNA). The child in lane 4 carries this mutation on the second
chromosome and therefore exhibits a n intact 754-bp fragment in addition to the 550-, 110-, and 95-bp fragments of the Leulo7-Promutation.
B: Loss of a site for BalI: There are two normal sites for BalI in the amplified region, at bp 25077 in exon 4 and 25356 in IVS 4, predicting 207- and
comigrating 279- and 268-bp fragments. The mutation abolishes the site a t bp 25077 in exon 4, generating a 586-bp fragment from the 207- and
279-bp fragments. Lane 1,Fa (SCID);lane 2, GM 3136 (SCID);lane 3, GM 4396 (partially deficient); lane 4, GM 7103 (partially deficient); lane 5,
GM 7104, mother of 7103; lane 6, normal; lane 7, normal, undigested. All patients are heterozygous for the mutation. C: Detection of the exon 7
Ar$ll-His mutation by loss of a site for RsaI: The primers amplify a 739-bp fragment extending from IVS6 (bp28376) to IVS 9 (bp 29115). There is
only one site for RsaI in the area amplified at bp 28517 in exon 7, predicting 141- and 598-bp fragments. The Arg'l-His mutation destroys the
normal site, resulting in the intact 739 bp fragment. Lane 1, GM 2608, mother of GM2606; lane 2, GM 2610, father of GM 2606; lane 3, GM 2606

BstXI: The primers used were as in C, amplifyinga 739-bp fragment. There are no sites forBstX1 in the normal. The mutation generates a new site
in exon 7 at bp 28529 of genomic DNA and predicts the generation of 586- and 153-bp fragments. Lane 1, GM 11413, father ofGM 11411:lane 2, GM

confirm that the L e ~ “ ~ - P mutation
ro
occurs on 2 of the
45 ADA - SCID chromosomes (GM 3136 and Fa (as well
as on two partially ADA - deficient chromosomes, GM
7103 and GM 4396). The mutation could be detected by
this method, both by loss of a site for Ban and gain of a
site for MspI (Figs. 4A and 4B, Table 11)[Hirschhorn et
al., 19901. Similarly, the G13l6-to-Argmutation could
be detected as the gain of a site for BstXI (Fig. 4D, Table
11). The results confirmed that one patient was homozygous and two patients (GM 1390 and 2436) were heterozygous for the mutation (4145ADA - chromosomes)

pendently a t least twice, since the mutation was found
on different chromosomal backgrounds in the 2 children
initially reported (GM 2756 and 28251, as evidenced by
silent base pair differences in the cDNAs [Akeson et al.,
19871, as well as differences in haplotypes defined by
intragenic RFLPs at the ADA locus [Tzall et al., 19891.
Two of the patients reported here as carrying the mutation and one of the originally reported patients (GM
2756) could all carry the mutation on the same rare
haplotype (IX). Thus DM is homozygous for haplotype
IX and for the mutation GM 4258 is heterozygous IX/II
and carries the mutation on the IX haplotype [unpublished data and Tzall et al., 19891, while the RFLPs
in GM 2756 are compatible with IWI haplotypes, with
the mutation on the IX haplotype. These 3 patients are
also all of Afro-American background, consistent with
the mutation having derived in these patients from a
common progenitor and suggesting that the mutation
may be more frequent in patients of Afro-American
background. The third patient newly identified as carrying the mutation (TE),like GM 2825, carries the mutation on a different chromosomal background, since he
is homozygous for the common PstI RFLP [unpublished
data] and therefore cannot carry a IX haplotype [Tzall et
al., 19891.It is not surprising that the mutation has been
recurrent, since it is a G-to-A transition a t a CG dinucleotide. In human DNA, cytosine is methylated
when followed by a guanosine (CG dinucleotide). Methylated cytosine can spontaneously deaminate to thymine, resulting in a C-to-T transition if the deamination
occurred initially on the coding strand and a G-to-A
transition if the mutation originally occurred on the
antisense noncoding strand. Therefore, CG dinucleotides represent so-called mutational hot spots [reviewed in Cooper and Krawczak, 19901.
Two mutations, in addition to the Ala329-to-Valmutation, were found to occur in more than one unrelated
patient, and both are also C-to-Tor G-to-Amutations at
CG dinucleotides (Arg211to His and Gly’” to Arg, Table
I). However, since both ofthese latter mutations occur in
individuals homozygous or heterozygous for the most
common haplotypes, we cannot definitively determine if
they represent descent from a common progenitor or,
like the Ala329-to-Valmutation, are independently recurrent.
Study of additional ADA- SCID patients for these
mutations using the simple methodology described here
should more definitively define the frequency of these
mutations.

DISCUSSION
We have determined that 5 missense mutations a t the
ADA locus can be detected by alterations in restriction
fragments and have now also developed PCR based nonradioactive rapid methods for their identification. As
with all PCR-based detection of mutations, the methodology can give both “false positives and negatives.”
Thus, polymorphism a t the site of the amplifying
primers can lead to amplification of only one allele (or
neither) and therefore potentially false negatives. However, such considerations do not apply to this study, since
all mutations were also identified by standard Southern
blotting and hybridization. Conversely, false positives
could theoretically occur because of the generation of a
new site for the same restriction enzyme, but at a site
other than the one described here. However, to result in
a “false positive,” the alteration would also have to generate the same size fragments. Therefore, DNA from a
cell line carrying each of the mutations (available from
the NIH Mutant Repository) should be used as a reference on the same gel. In addition, loss of the same restriction site could occur because of a change at a different base pair that could be a silent, rare normal
polymorphism. However, 4 of the 5 mutations generate
abnormal restriction fragments by the creation of a new
restriction enzyme site, therefore defining the single
base pair change.
We have further determined the frequency of these 5
mutations in a sample of 45 ADA - SCID chromosomes
and found that they account for one third of the chromosomes. All but one of the mutations was found in more
than one unrelated patient, and the 5 mutations together account for one third of the alleles. Two of the
mutations (Leu3O4-Proand Ala3”-Val) were the most
common and accounted for 25 percent of the chromosomes (10145).The Ala3”-Val mutation, found here on
