The hallmarks of the X-linked athalassemidmental retardation (ATR-X)
syndrome are severe psychomotor retardation, minor facial anomalies, genital
abnormalities, and an unusual form of
a-thalassemia. The demonstration of HbH
inclusions in red blood cells after incubation with brilliant cresyl blue confirms the
diagnosis. We describe 15 previously unreported cases and analyse the phenotypic
and hematologic findings in these subjects
and compare them with previously published cases. This study demonstrates the
consistency of the main characteristics of
this syndrome and extends the phenotype.
Developmental changes in phenotype, in
particular the coarsening of the facial appearance, are illustrated. The hematologic
findings are shown to vary widely; in some
cases the manifestation of a-thalassemia
may be subtle and missed without repeated
examination. 0 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

INTRODUCTION
We have previously reported 16 individuals with the
syndrome of severe, X-linked mental retardation associated with an unusual form of a-thalassemia (ATR-X
syndrome) which maps to the region Xq12-q21.31
[Gibbons e t al., 1991, 19921. Although the first few
cases were ascertained hematologically [Wilkie et al.,
1990; Harvey et al., 19901, the recurring phenotypic
manifestations of this syndrome, which include a characteristic facial phenotype associated with a variety of
genital and minor skeletal abnormalities, have led to
the identification of other cases in whom no hematologic abnormality had previously been suspected (see
Table I).
Although the molecular basis for ATR-X is currently
unknown, a n unequivocal diagnosis can be made by
demonstrating HbH (p4) inclusions in the peripheral
red blood cells of the affected individual. This objective
diagnostic criterion h a s allowed u s to extend and characterise in detail the clinical and hematologic phenotype of individuals with the ATR-X syndrome. This
paper presents data on 47 cases, including 15 unpublished patients who are described in detail. Sequential
and cross-sectional observations throughout a wide
range of ages have also allowed us to document some of
the developmental changes in phenotype associated
with this syndrome.
CLINICAL REPORTS
The diagnosis of 15 previously unreported cases of
ATR-X was confirmed by the presence of HbH inclusions after incubation of the blood with 1% brilliant
cresyl blue at room temperature. The pedigrees are
shown in Figure 1. A compendium of all currently
known cases of ATR-X, their nomenclature, and references is given in Table I. Birth details, post-natal
growth, and age at diagnosis are in Table 11. The clinical manifestations, both summary and details are in

Previously reported "cases." These numbers do not refer to the case numbers given to subjects reported in this paper.

Tables 111 and IV, respectively. Hematologic data are
given in Table V. The chromosome constitution in all
15 cases is 46,XY.

Case 1 (Pedigree 11, Not Shown)
Hypotonia and bilateral cryptorchidism were noted
at birth. Developmental delay was first noted at

9 months. At 2 years he could sit unsupported for a few
seconds, he was standing at 4 years and walking
unaided at 5 years. He underwent extensive metabolic
investigations because of hypotonia and "coarse" facial
appearance. A diagnosis of Angelman syndrome was
suggested when he was 4 years old. He has never had
seizures and EEG is normal.

Case 3 (Pedigree 12, Fig. 2)
He had feeding difficulty from birth with regurgitation of milk up the nose; a cleft of the soft palate was
found at 6 weeks. He started to “bottom shuffle” at
2 years but has never crawled. He started walking with
support at age 10 years and without support at 13
years. He has no speech and a very limited ability to
feed himself. Vision and hearing appear intact, but his
optic discs are pale.

He required surgery for a strangulated inguinal hernia at 8 years. At 9 years he has no speech but smiles
socially and responds to his name. He is myopic, suffers
recurrent chest infections and blepharitis, and has
frequent “breath holding” episodes. His feet and hands
often become cold and blue.

Case 2 (Pedigree 11, Not Shown)
He is the brother of case 1.He was a poor feeder from
birth and this was initially attributed to the fact that
he had micrognathia. He was monitored because of
poor weight gain and hypotonia. His facial appearance
was noted to be very similar to his brother’s. Developmental delay became apparent by the age of 6 months.
By 18 months his tone and feeding had improved and
he was able to sit unsupported. He too suffers from
recurrent blepharitis. He smiles socially but is not yet
able to say any recognisable words.

Case 4 (Pedigree 13, Fig. 3)
In previous pregnancies there had been a miscarriage and an ectopic pregnancy. At birth he was
cyanosed and required oxygen. Multiple abnormalities
were evident: he had an abnormal facial appearance, a
striking frontal hair whorl, a short webbed neck, widely
spaced nipples, and a positional deformity of the feet.
He was severely hypotonic, lethargic with a poor suck,

By 5 months, delay in his motor development was
apparent. On renogram there is decreased function in
the right kidney.

Case 5 (Pedigree 14, Fig. 4a,b)
As a baby he had always been a slow feeder. During
infancy, cryptorchidism and hypospadias were noted
and bilateral inguinal herniae were repaired. At
12 months aortic stenosis was diagnosed. Vomiting and
regurgitation were problems in childhood. At 4 years he
had episodes of hematemesis following which a hiatus
hernia and peptic ulcer were found. He sat without
support at 3 years, crawled at 4 years, and walked unsupported at 11years. Though vocalising from 6 years
he has no intelligible speech at 22 years and rudimentary comprehension.
It seems likely that there have been several other
affected individuals in this family (Fig. 1,pedigree 14).

Fig. 3. Case 4 at 1.5 yr

1-3, 1-4, and 11-1 died in childhood, 111-4 was stillborn but no other details are available. 11-8 was
severely developmentally delayed, required braces for
bilateral talipes equinovarus and family photographs
show a striking resemblance to case 5. He died of pneumonia at age 2% years. 111-9 was similarly mentally
retarded, had cryptorchidism, and gastro-oesophageal
reflux. A photograph suggests the same diagnosis.
He died at age 3% years during a severe vomiting
attack.

Fig. 2. Case 3 at 13 yr.

Case 6 (Pedigree 15, Fig. 5a,b)
At birth he required 24 hours in a special care unit
for abnormal temperature control and because of poor
feeding was tube fed for 6 days. At 4 years a diagnosis
of the Coffin-Lowry syndrome was made with some
reservation because only mild finger tapering was present. At 11 months he had bilateral orchidopexy and
herniotomy. He sat without support at 18 months. At

appearance.

6% years he can walk a few steps unaided, has no
speech, but responds t o a few words.

Case 7 (Pedigree 16, Fig. 6)
Little is known about the neonatal period. He sat
without support at 4 years but a t 17 years does not
walk. He has no speech and minimal comprehension.
A brother (Fig. 1, pedigree 16,111-3) died at 2 months.
Autopsy findings were renal “dysgenesis,” hyperplasia
of the islets of Langerhans, and infantile cortical
hyperostosis. No photographs are available and since
these findings are not suggestive of ATR-X it is uncertain whether he was affected.
Case 8 (Pedigree 17, Fig. 7a,b)
He was born by Caesarean section for breech presentation after a n uneventful pregnancy apart from poor
fetal movements. Facial abnormalities, micropenis,
and hypotonia were noted at birth. Psychomotor retardation was evident from an early stage. He first
grasped at 2 years, sat freely at 3%years, and pulled to
stand with splints at 6%years. At 6%years he does not
speak or understand language but is thought to have
some situational understanding; his psychomotor
development is below that of a 1-year-old. Initially he
appeared t o have severe deafness but this is now
thought to be a problem of auditory perception and understanding. He has amblyopia with nystagmus, bilateral optic atrophy, and hypermetropia. A CT brain scan

Fig. 6. Case 7 at 1 7 yr.

showed mild cerebral atrophy. Abdominal ultrasound
showed a small spleen. A brother (Fig. 1: pedigree 17,
111-1)had a similar physiognomy, microcephaly, hypogenitalism, hypotonia, and severe psychomotor retardation. From 7 months he developed sudden, brief
muscular spasms especially in the upper limbs. He had
poor feeding with frequent, severe vomiting. He had
recurrent urinary and upper airway infections. He died
at age 4% years of pneumonia.

Case 9 (Pedigree 18, Fig. 8 )
He was noted to have an abnormal appearance at
birth and was difficult to feed. By 6 months his motor
development was delayed. He had pneumonia at
9 months and has had frequent upper respiratory tract
infections. He sat at 3%years. He has had periods of
crying for days, associated with food refusal and head
banging. At 7 years, he has no articulate speech, no
verbal comprehension, and does not recognise faces.
He persists in biting his hand leading to severe maceration. An MRI scan of the brain, at age 4 years, was
normal.
Case 10 (Pedigree 19, Fig. 9)
At birth he was noted to be floppy and lethargic and
to have an abnormal appearance. Low-set ears, a higharched palate with a submucous cleft, left talipes calca-

Case 11 (Pedigree 20, Fig. 10)
He was born by a normal delivery after external
cephalic version for breech presentation. Apart from
severe bilateral talipes equinovarus, he was thought
normal at birth. Reportedly his initial development was
satisfactory: at 2 months he was responding to his
mother. At 3 4 months his condition is said to have
deteriorated, he became very floppy and was difficult to
feed. At 13 years he is severely retarded. He has no
speech and comprehends very little but responds to his
name. He can only just sit unsupported. He has impaired vision owing to repeated conjunctivitis and keratitis and impaired hearing. He has poorly controlled
seizures. Constipation is a major problem and has
required hospital admission for manual evacuation. He
has marked dental decay. A CT brain scan at 7 months
of age showed mild cerebral atrophy but no focal
abnormality.

neovalgus deformity, flexion contractures of the fingers,
cryptorchidism, and an atrial septal defect were noted.
Congenital hypothyroidism was suspected but subsequent investigations documented a delayed but normal thyroid stimulation response. He required 6 weeks
hospitalisation because of difficulty feeding and maintaining body temperature. At 5 months he had a
“collapse” necessitating ventilation. Regurgitation has
been a problem and he had a Nissen fundoplication
for a hiatus hernia at 12 months. At 18 months he
developed seizures. At 12 years a renal calculus was detected by intravenous pyelography. At 17 years myopia
was observed. Constipation is a major problem in his
management.
He has severe psychomotor retardation. He sat at
6 years and has never walked. He has no speech and
very poor comprehension, but turns to his name.
His oldest brother (Fig. 1: pedigree 19,II-1)was born
prematurely and died at about 3 months. The fourth
pregnancy was another boy who again was born prematurely and only survived a few days.

Case 12 (Pedigree 20, Fig. 11)
He is the maternal cousin of case 11 (pedigree 20,
111-4). He was delivered by Caesarean section. He had
convulsions in the neonatal period with episodes of
apnoea and cyanosis. Fifth finger camptodactyly was
noted at birth. A secundum atrial septal defect possibly
with a small patent ductus arteriosus were demonstrated by echocardiography. Although he has severe
psychomotor retardation he is strikingly more attentive than his affected cousin. He has been able to drink
from a beaker from the age of 4 years. At 6 years he
sits without support but does not walk. His comprehension is poor. He has two discernible words “dad dad”
and “nan nan.” He sleeps poorly, has screaming fits,
and bites his hand.
His maternal half brother (Fig. 1: pedigree 20,111-1)
had severe developmental delay, microcephaly, and a
similar physiognomy. He also had camptodactyly of the
5th fingers, 2-3 syndactyly of the toes, cryptorchidism,
and a right inguinal hernia. Constipation, recurrent
vomiting, and chest infections were problems. He died
at age 6 years. A maternal uncle, 11-4, was born pre-

maturely and died within a few days; another, 11-6, was
severely retarded and died aged 3 years. Hi5 nonidentical twin brother, 11-5, is normal.
Case 13 (Pedigree21, Fig. 12a,b)
Developmental delay was first noted a t 7 months. He
sat freely at 13 months and was walking a t 3%years.
He cried almost continuously during his first 5 years.
He had bronchopneumonia at 3 years. A salivary duct
transposition has reduced his excessive salivation. He
has had extensive dental decay requiring multiple
extractions. At 27 years he feeds independently, has no
articulate speech but does use the Makaton sign
“please.” His comprehension is very poor but he is
aware when it is mealtime.
Case 14 (Pedigree 21, Fig. 13a,b)
He is the brother of case 13 (Fig. 1: pedigree 21). He
was first noted to be delayed at 4 months with poor
head control. He had a similar facial appearance to his
brother. He sat without support a t 26 months. At
2%years his right leg was found to be shorter than the
left, and a sacral dimple was noted. Spinal radiographs
showed a spina bifida of L5 and possibly S1. He walked

changes with age.

from the age of 11years. At 23 years his legs are short,
especially the right leg, and there is marked reduction
in muscle bulk in both legs. He has no speech, his comprehension is poor but noticeably better than his
brother. He has episodes of agitation and headbanging.
The facial appearance of both brothers has “coarsened” considerably with age (Fig. 12b and 13b).

Case 15 (Pedigree 22, Fig. 14)
At birth he was noted to have an abnormal facial
appearance; he was floppy and difficult to feed. Other
findings were glandular hypospadias, a deficient prepuce, and an intermittent right divergent squint. An
atrial septa1 defect with a left to right shunt was
demonstrated by echocardiography.
DISCUSSION
This study brings to 47 the number of published
cases of ATR-X syndrome (Table I). Tables I11 and IV
compare the clinical findings of the 15 patients
described here and summarise the frequency with
which certain traits are manifested in the 47 patients
described with ATR-X.

Fig. 14. Case 15 at 14 days.

ATR-X Clinical and Hematologic Findings

Facial Anomalies
The physiognomy (Table IV) is characteristic and
recognisable from birth. Although absolute telecanthus
is found in only one third of patients, telecanthus relative to head circumference is observed in most. Other
key findings are epicanthic folds (84%), flat nasal
bridge (72%), and midface hypoplasia (88%). The nose
is particularly characteristic, being small and triangular (87%) with anteverted nares (89%). The mouth is
triangular in shape (98%) with a full lower lip and
is commonly described as “carp-shaped.” The incisors
are frequently widely spaced (67%). Microcephaly
(Tables I1 and 111)is seen in 71%. One notable observation is how the physiognomy appears to coarsen
with age (e.g., cases 5 [Fig. 4b1, 13 [Fig. 12b1, and 14
[Fig. 13bl) and become less specific. It is important t o
check photographs in childhood t o see the distinctive
early changes.
Psychomotor Retardation
and Central Nervous System
In all cases of ATR-X syndrome, psychomotor retardation is severe, global, and apparent from an early age
(Table 111). Hypotonia and feeding difficulties are
commonly encountered in the neonatal period. Patients
frequently do not walk until late in childhood and a few
are unable t o walk independently by their late teens or
twenties. They need assistance with all aspects of daily
living; some are able to feed themselves with a spoon or
fingers and some may cooperate with dressing. Comprehension is very poor but attentiveness may vary
considerably between cases. Two subjects have one or
two discernible words but it is not clear whether these
are used appropriately. None has achieved more than
partial bowel or bladder control. In two cases [case 11
in this paper; and proband in Ogle et al., 19941a period
with apparent neurological deterioration has been
described. In one case, [case 4, Donnai et al., 19911 an
episode involving intractable seizures occurred which
was thought to represent acute encephalitis.
Seizures occur in just over one third (Table 111).
These do not appear to have a particular character. Abnormal movements have been commented on in 6 cases;
jerking arm movements have been described in four,
athetoid movements in one, and extrapyramidal movements in one. Assessment of vision and hearing is difficult. Vision usually appears normal (despite optic
atrophy and nystagmus in case 8).One subject (case 11)
is visually impaired. Pale discs may be observed and
refractive errors and strabismus are common. Hearing
is usually normal although it is impaired in case 11.
The subjects are usually content and affectionate
but, although only ascertained in a few, there have been
reports of emotional outbursts with sustained laughing
or crying.
Genital Abnormalities
Almost all of the patients have genital abnormalities
(Tables I11 and IV).These may be subtle, as in small
soft testes. Cryptorchidism is seen in two thirds. Hypoplastic scrotum, small penis, and hypospadias are each
seen in one fifth of patients. A deficiency in the prepuce

297

that gives the appearance of a complete or partial circumcision has been seen in 6 patients. Puberty is frequently delayed and in one or two cases appears to be
arrested. In the original report [Wilkie et al., 19901 a
case with ambiguous genitalia was described. More
recently two families have been reported in which
affected individuals have had female or ambiguous
external genitalia [McPherson et al., 1994; Reardon
et al., 19941. The more severe genital abnormality
seems to breed true in these families and may indicate
that a particular mutation accounts for this phenotype.

Skeletal Abnormalities
A wide range of relatively mild skeletal abnormalities has been noted (Tables I11 and IV). Fixed flexion
deformities particularly of the fingers are common.
Other abnormalities of the fingers and toes that have
been observed are clinodactyly,brachydactyly, tapering
fingers, overlapping digits, a single case of 2-3 syndactyly of the toes and a single case with a bifid thumb.
Foot deformities occur in 40% and include pes planus,
talipes equinovarus, and talipes calcaneovalgus. Almost half the cases have kyphosis andfor scoliosis, and
pectus carinatum has been seen in 5 cases. In this
report case 14 had a sacral dimple and radiological
spina bifida at L5 and S1. There were clinical signs that
he had neurological impairment associated with this.
Only a few of the cases have had thorough radiological
investigation. In those who have, the most common
finding was delayed bone age.
Short stature was seen in three quarters of cases.
Longitudinal data are available in only a few cases. As
has been noted previously, in some patients growth
retardation is apparent throughout life whereas in
others it has become manifest at a later stage, for example around the time of the pubertal growth spurt.
Miscellaneous Abnormalities
Excessive salivation is very common (87%); saliva
duct transposition was of benefit in case 13. Vomiting or
regurgitation are troublesome particularly in childhood
and in some cases reflux with aspiration has been
demonstrated. It seems likely that this propensity may
account for apnoeic episodes and chest infections t o
which some of these subjects are prone. Constipation is
common and in some individuals is a major management problem having led to fecal impaction requiring
hospital admission; in one case rectal prolapse has
occurred. The present report extends the range of other
abnormalities seen in this condition. Two cases with
cleft soft palate are described. Previously septa1 defects
and patent ductus arteriosus had been reported, now a
case with aortic stenosis is described. Two minor renal
abnormalities are reported. It has been noted that some
of the boys tend to have very cold and blue extremities.
Hematology
The patients originally reported with ATR-X syndrome had HbH disease, a form of a-thalassemia with
sufficient HbH (p4 tetramers) to be detected as an abnormal band on electrophoresis. It was, nevertheless,
noted to be a milder type of HbH disease (with less

298

Gibbons et al.

hypochromia and lower levels of HbH) than that
found when HbH disease is associated with cis-acting
mutations in the a-globin complex. As confirmation
that the a-thalassemia is not the result of a-globin gene
deletions, we determined the a-globin genotype in a t
least one affected member from each family. In this
report, as in previous cases, no a-gene deletions were
found.
A review of 16 cases in 1991 indicated that the original cases described by Wilkie et al. [1990], and Harvey
et al. [1990], all of which had been ascertained hematologically, lay at the severe end of the hematologic
spectrum, and that many cases do not have sufficient
HbH to be detected by electrophoresis [Gibbons et al.,
19911. The most sensitive test is to look by light microscopy for red cells containing HbH inclusions after
incubation, at room temperature, of venous blood with
1%brilliant cresyl blue for 4-24 hours. This report extends these findings. Although many patients have low
indices for hemoglobin levels and mean cell hemoglobin, a substantial number fall within the normal
range (Figs. 15 and 16). The proportion of cells with
HbH inclusions also varies widely (Fig. 17). Logie et al.
[ 19941have recently reported a case in which only after
repeated testing were rare inclusions (0.01%)seen, and
caution that when there is a high index of suspicion
from the family history and phenotype a careful search
for HbH inclusions should be made and repeated if necessary. Figure 17 documents several cases with rare
inclusions (<O. 1%).

Phenotype of Carriers
In 6 of 25 obligate carriers rare (0.1%to 0.001%)cells
with HbH inclusions were found (unpublished data).
Studies of the pattern of X inactivation in carriers for
ATR-X show that the abnormal X chromosome is
predominantly inactivated in cells from a variety of
tissues, explaining the scarcity of cells with HbH inclusions in these individuals [Gibbons et al., 19921.
Donnai et al. [1991], reported hypertelorism and
midface hypoplasia in a mother and sister who also exhibited occasional HbH inclusions. However, in other
families, there is no indication that facial changes are
a common manifestation of carrier status.

ditism, appear t o “breed true” within a family, suggesting that there could be allelic variants of the ATR-X
locus.
The demonstration of HbH inclusions in the peripheral blood is a sine qua non for the diagnosis of ATR-X.
However, as in previous reports this study shows that
without this specific diagnostic feature there is some
phenotypic overlap with other conditions including the
Coffin-Lowry, Angelman, FG, and Smith-Lemli-Opitz
syndromes. Furthermore, with increasing age the face
of ATR-X patients may “coarsen,” appearing less
specific and superficially may resemble some of the
lysosomal storage diseases. Hall [19921 has also suggested that the ATR-X phenotype might be confused
with Smith-Fineman-Myers, tetrasomy 12p, and
Smith-Magenis syndromes.
The possibility must be considered that some individuals might have variants of ATR-X in which HbH
inclusions cannot be readily found. As noted by Logie
et al. [1994] in some cases inclusions may be rare and
the diagnosis of ATR-X should not be excluded before
careful, repeated examination of fresh blood preparations. However, in some cases despite considerable
similarities in other aspects of the phenotype no cells
containing HbH inclusions can be demonstrated
(R. Gibbons, unpublished data). Might such families
harbour allelic variants of the ATR-X locus? It will only
be possible t o address this question when the molecular
basis for ATR-X is known. Further refinement of the
localisation of the ATR-X mutation and analysis of candidate genes is currently underway; identification of
the ATR-X gene will undoubtedly elucidate the basis for
one and possibly more of the syndromal forms of
X-linked mental retardation.
