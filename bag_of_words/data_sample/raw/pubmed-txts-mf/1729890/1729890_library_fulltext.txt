Summary
A mutation involving an A-to-G nucleotide replacement at position 985 of the medium-chain acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase (MCAD) cDNA was found in homozygous form in 18 unrelated MCAD-deficient families
and in heterozygous form in 4 families. By PCR amplification and sequencing of cDNA from a compound
heterozygote, we have detected a new mutation in an MCAD-deficient patient in whom one MCAD allele
produces mRNA that is missing 4 bp in the MCAD cDNA, while the other allele carries the A-to-G-985
mutation. The presence of this 4-bp deletion was confirmed in the patient's genomic DNA by dot-blot
hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes and by restriction analysis of PCR products. A rapid
screening test for this 4-bp deletion was developed, based on mismatched primer PCR amplification. The
deletion created a new restrictive-enzyme site which yielded two DNA fragments. The 4-bp deletion was not
found in the three remaining MCAD chromosomes not harboring the A-to-G-985 mutation, nor it was
present in 20 chromosomes from 10 unrelated normal Caucasians. The PCR-based method for screening these
two mutations can detect over 93% of all MCAD mutations.

Introduction

Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder which may
present in the first 2 years of life, as sudden unexplained death, Reyes syndrome, or encephalopathy
with or without hypoglycemia. It is estimated to occur
in 1/6,000-1/10,000 live Caucasian births. Each
year approximately 500 new cases in the United States
are expected, of which one-fourth will die with their
first episode (Roe and Coates 1989). In fact, many
families in which MCAD deficiency is recognized have
already sustained the unexplained loss of a child. Once
the diagnosis is made, further loss of a sibling because
of MCAD deficiency can be prevented; avoidance of
fasting, carnitine supplementation, and prompt intravenous glucose therapy during acute illness all constitute effective therapy.

Human and rat MCAD cDNAs have been cloned
and sequenced (Kelly et al. 1987; Matsubara et al.
1987). The coding region is 1,263-bp and encodes a
421-amino-acid precursor protein. At the molecular
level an A-to-G nucleotide replacement at position 985
(G-985) of the MCAD cDNA appears to be the single
prevalent mutation causing MCAD deficiency (Matsubara et al. 1990; Yokota et al. 1990b; Ding et al.
1990; Kelly et al. 1990), although a 13-bp tandemrepeat insertion from position 999 (Yokota et al.
1990a) has been reported in a single patient. With a
PCR-based method to screen the A-to-G-985 mutation, we have demonstrated its use in diagnosis and
carrier detection of MCAD deficiency, by using (1)
dried blood spots on filter papers, (2) paraffinembedded tissue, and (3) formalin-fixed tissue (Ding
et al. 1991). The ability to diagnose MCAD deficiency
in postmortem fixed tissues is particularly relevant,
since this disorder often presents as sudden infant
death.
In the present paper we extend our molecular investigation of A-to-G-985 mutation to a total of 22 unrelated MCAD-deficient families. We found that 4 families are compound heterozygotes for the mutation. In

one of these families, we identified a new mutation
which involved a 4-bp deletion in the MCAD gene.

Patients and Methods
Patients
Twenty-two families of northern-European origin

who were affected by MCAD deficiency were studied.
The diagnosis of all probands was based on detection
of metabolites characteristic of MCAD deficiency
(Millington et al. 1989). This was confirmed in 12
families by fibroblast-enzyme assay (Coates et al.
1985).
Cloning and Sequencing of MCAD cDNA

Total RNA was prepared from peripheral lymphoby guanidinium-chloride extraction methods
(Cox 1968). First-strand cDNA synthesized from total
RNA by using AMV reverse transcriptase (Bethesda
Research Lab, Gaithersburg, MD) was used for PCR
to amplify the entire coding region of MCAD cDNA.
The conditions for amplification were as follows: 100
pl reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.3), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% (w/v) gelatin, 1 gI of
first-strand cDNA synthesis mixture (as template
DNA), 50 pmol of each of the appropriate sense and
antisense PCR primers (which were constructed so
that BamHI sequences are present at the 5' and 3' ends
of the PCR products; table 1, oligonucleotide 1 and
cytes

2), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, and 2.5 units Taq DNA
polymerase (Perkin Elmer-Cetus, Norwalk, CT);
the overlay was 60 pl of mineral oil. The reaction was
amplified for 30 cycles by denaturing at 940C for 1
min, annealing at 560C for 1 min, and extending at
720C for 1.5 min. The PCR product was extracted
with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol, and the pellet was resuspended in 30 pl of TE
buffer. The PCR product was then digested with
BamHI (Bethesda Research Lab, Gaithersburg, MD)
and subcloned into pGEM 3Zf( + ) Vectors (Promega
Biotec, Madison, WI). Double-stranded dideoxy sequencing (Sanger et al. 1977) was performed using
[35S] dATP and the Sequenase DNA-sequencing kit
(United States Biochemical, Cleveland) with T7, SP6,
or MCAD-specific primers (table 1, oligonucleotide 3
and 4).
Identification of Mutation in the Genomic DNA
To detect A-to-G-985 mutation, genomic DNA was
amplified with mismatched primers (table 1, oligonucleotides 5 and 6) digested with NcoI and subjected to
electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gel (Ding et
al. 1990). To validate the 4-bp deletion, genomic

DNA corresponding to MCAD cDNA (position from
1052 to 1141) was PCR amplified with primers (table
1, oligonucleotides 7 and 8). The amplified products
were dot blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane and
hybridized with [32p] allele-specific oligonucleotides
(table 1, oligonucleotide 9 and 10). Prehybridization

and hybridization conditions were as described elsewhere (Chen et al. 1982), except that the hybridization temperature was 370C.
For rapid screening and further confirmation of the
4-bp deletion, the genomic DNA was amplified with
mismatched primers (table 1, oligonucleotides 8 and
11). The amplified products were then subjected to
BbvI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) enzyme
digestion and electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide
gels.
Results

Twenty-two unrelated MCAD-deficient families
were screened for the presence of A-to-G-985 mutation by restriction analysis of PCR products. This
group included 10 families whom we have reported
elsewhere (Ding et al. 1990). The A-to-G-985 mutation was present in homozygous form in 18 families
and was present in heterozygous form in the remaining
4 families. One of the compound-heterozygote patients was further studied by PCR amplification and
sequencing of cDNA. Three cDNA clones were sequenced. One differed from the wild-type MCADcDNA sequence by the substitution of A to G at position 985, a result consistent with the genomic data.
The other two cDNA clones had normal A at position
985 as the wild type, but a 4-bp deletion from position
1102 to position 1105 of MCAD cDNA was found
(fig. 1). There were no other nucleotide changes observed.
The presence of the 4-bp deletion was confirmed in
the patient's genomic DNA by dot-blot hybridization
analysis with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes
(data not shown) and by direct visualization of restricted DNA PCR products on gel electrophoresis.
Since neither the normal nor the deletion allele surrounding the deletion contained a restriction site that
could be used for segregating normal and mutant sequences, we used mismatched primers to amplify genomic DNA at the regions containing the predicted
mutations, to create a new restriction site recognized
by enzyme BbvI. After BbvI digestion, the 60-bp DNA
fragment amplified from normal individuals remained
intact (fig. 2A), while the compound-heterozygote patients having the 4-bp deletion three fragments were
seen. The allele without the deletion remained intact
as a 60-bp fragment, while the deletion allele yielded
two fragments (33 bp and 23 bp) (fig. 2B). The patterns, however, do not allow distinction between patients and carriers, for the 4-bp deletion.

(B) showing deletion of 4 bp (TTAG). The arrowhead indicates the
position of the deletion which corresponds to MCAD cDNA from
1102 to 1105.

By restriction analysis of the PCR product, both
proband and affected sibling inherited the 4-bp deletion allele from their father (fig. 2B) and an A-to-G985 allele from their mother. The unaffected sibling
inherited both the normal alleles from each of his parents (fig. 2B). The maternal side of this family has its
origins in England, while the paternal side derives
from the French-speaking part of Switzerland and
from Wales. PCR study of the paternal grandparents
revealed that the 4-bp deletion came from the paternal
Welsh ancestry. The remaining three families with
affected children who are compound heterozygous for
the A-to-G-985 mutation were screened for the presence of this 4-bp deletion; none of these have revealed
the same 4-bp deletion. Studies of 10 unrelated normal
Caucasians did not reveal the mutation.
Discussion
A new mutation involving a 4-bp deletion in the
MCAD cDNA at positions 1102 to 1105 in a patient
with MCAD deficiency has been identified. The deletion could involve either cDNA positions 1100 to
1103 or cDNA positions 1101 to 1104, since both
positions 1100 to 1101 and positions 1104 to 1105
have AG nucleotides. In any case, the deletion pro-

(B). Genomic DNA fragments were amplified with mismatched primers, digested with BbvI, and subjected to electrophoresis on 12%
polyacrylamide gel. The allele without the 4-bp deletion remained intact as a 60-bp fragment, but digestion of the mutant DNA yielded
two fragments (33 bp and 23 bp). The proband (arrowhead) and affected sibling were compound heterozygotes; the hatched portions

duced altered amino acids from codon 368 to codon
386 and created a premature termination codon
(TAG) at positions 1160 to 1162. Thus, the deletion
would predict an early truncation of the MCAD protein (385 amino acids vs. 421) and may, therefore,
affect function of the gene product, beyond any significance which the new altered amino acids may have
had.
The mechanism by which the 4-bp deletion described here has occurred is unclear. The PCR experiment with genomic DNA demonstrates that this deletion takes place in an exon, since the size of the
amplified genomic DNA was the same as would be
predicted from the cDNA, and our genomic genesequences data indicate no intron between cDNA positions 944 and 1194 (authors' unpublished observation). This suggests that the 4-bp deletion is not the
result of abnormal splicing at the intron/exon junction. Examination of cDNA sequences flanking the
region of deletion did not reveal either tandem repeat
of short motifs or significant homologous sequences
flanking the deletion. These factors might have explained such a deletion (Roth et al. 1985; Chandley
1989; Jarman and Wells 1989).
