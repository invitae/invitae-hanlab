Summary

Introduction

Two deletions of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene were previously shown to account for about
two thirds of all mutations causing familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in Finland. We screened the DNA samples from a cohort representing the remaining 30% of
Finnish heterozygous FH patients by amplifying all the
18 exons of the receptor gene by PCR and searching for
DNA variations with the SSCP technique. Ten novel
mutations were identified, comprising two nonsense and
seven missense mutations as well as one frameshift mutation caused by a 13-bp deletion. A single nucleotide
change, substituting adenine for guanidine at position
2533 and resulting in an amino acid change of glycine
to aspartic acid at codon 823, was found in DNA samples from 14 unrelated FH probands. This mutation
(FH-Turku) affects the sequence encoding the putative
basolateral sorting signal of the LDL receptor protein;
however, the exact functional consequences of this mutation are yet to be examined. The FH-Turku gene and
another point mutation (Leu380-+His or FH-Pori) together account for -8% of the FH-causing genes in
Finland and are particularly common among FH patients from the southwestern part of the country (combined, 30%). Primer-introduced restriction analysis was
applied for convenient assay of the FH-Turku and FHPori point mutations. In conclusion, this paper demonstrates the unique genetic background of FH in Finland
and describes a commonly occurring FH gene with a
missense mutation closest to the C terminus thus far
reported.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is among the
world's most common single-gene inherited diseases.
The very rare homozygous patients may succumb to
myocardial infarction in their childhoods, while the heterozygous ones, with a prevalence of 1 in 500 in the
population, develop clinical symptoms of premature
coronary heart disease in their 40s or 50s, if untreated
(Goldstein and Brown 1989). By 1992, >150 mutations
of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene causing FH were reported (Hobbs et al. 1992), and additional mutant genes are continuously characterized. The
Finns are among the few populations in which one or
two major mutations explain the majority of FH cases
(Kontula et al. 1992).
We have elsewhere identified two deletions, designated as FH-Helsinki and FH-North Karelia, that together account for the mutations present in 60% 70% of all heterozygous FH probands examined (AaltoSetala et al. 1989; Koivisto et al. 1992). The FH-Helsinki
gene is characterized by a 9,500-bp deletion extending
from intron 15 to exon 18 and is associated with an
internalization-defective phenotype of FH, while in the
FH-North Karelia gene 7 nt from exon 6 are deleted,
resulting in a frameshift of translation and a null-allele
phenotype of FH. In addition, in single Finnish kindreds
we have identified two large deletions, eliminating exons
7-10 and 11-16, respectively (Aalto-Setala et al. 1992),
and a point mutation in the proximal promoter area of
the LDL receptor gene (Koivisto et al. 1994). Another
rare large gene rearrangement deleting exon 15 (FHEspoo) was found to be associated with a relatively mild
form of FH (P. V. I. Koivisto et al. 1993).
The remaining LDL receptor gene mutations in Finnish FH patients were unknown in nature, until now.
Finns form a genetic isolate, with its typical panel of
inherited diseases and a high prevalence of hypercholesterolemia and coronary heart disease. In a search for
possible other prevalent LDL receptor gene genes, we
identified a collection of previously unreported minor

mutations as well as two that are relatively common in
the Finnish population.
Subjects and Methods
Patients

During our earlier study, blood samples were collected from 201 unrelated heterozygous FH probands
from five different regions of Finland. Details on diagnostic criteria, preparation of samples, and lipid analyses are given in the previous publication (Koivisto et
al. 1992). During the previous study, we identified 66
patients with the FH-Helsinki gene and 69 patients with
the FH-North Karelia gene (Koivisto et al. 1992). Of
the remaining 66 FH patients, we were later able to
reveal two additional patients with the FH-Helsinki gene
and one patient with the FH-North Karelia gene. In
addition, one patient was demonstrated to have a singlepoint mutation in the proximal promoter of the LDL
receptor gene (Koivisto et al. 1994), another proband
had a complex deletion/insertion rearrangement of the
LDL receptor gene (U.-M. Koivisto and K. Kontula, unpublished data), and we had to exclude 15 patients because of a questionable diagnosis and/or incomplete
clinical data or kinship to another proband. The remaining 46 patients were accepted for the present search
for novel mutations.
In addition, in order to conduct a search for the newly
discovered missense mutations in exons 9 and 17 among
southwestern Finns, we collected additional samples
from unrelated FH probands living in the Turku area
to expand this cohort up to 39 patients and the whole
FH panel up to a total of 213 patients. The present study
was approved by the ethical review committee of the
Department of Medicine, University of Helsinki.
DNA Analysis

All 18 exons of the LDL receptor gene were individually amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). The primers were designed according to the sequences published
by Leitersdorf et al. (1990). SSCP analysis was carried
out essentially according to the method described by
Orita et al. (1989) on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 10% glycerol. Exons displaying
aberrant migration patterns on SSCP gels were amplified
without labeled dCTP, and double-stranded amplification products were purified by the Magic PCR preps®
procedure (Promega). An aliquot was directly sequenced
according to a modification of the dideoxy chain termination method (Casanova et al. 1990) or subcloned into
the pSP73 vector, followed by sequencing of several independent clones. The direct solid-phase DNA sequencing was performed essentially as described by Koivisto
et al. (1994). Sequencing data were compared to the

Am. J. Hum. Genet. 57:789-797, 1995

normal LDL receptor cDNA sequence published by Yamamoto et al. (1984).
Assays for Specific Mutations
For convenient assay of the two common mutations
FH-Turku (G2533-+A) and FH-Pori (T1202-+A), as well
as the missense mutations FH-Fin-3 and FH-Fin-4 in exon
4 (G661-+T and G665-+A), the PCR-PIRA ("PCRprimer-introduced restriction analysis") (Jacobson and
Moskovits 1991) technique was applied. For the FHTurku mutation (G2533-- A), a new downstream primer
spanning the 3' end of exon 17 and 4 bases of the intron
17 sequence was synthesized with a deliberate A-+G mismatch located 2 nt in from the 3' terminus 3273 (5'TCACCGAGGGGTAGCTGTGG-3'). Upstream primer
was 9035 (5'TGACAGAGCGTGCCTCTCCCTACAG3'). Gene amplification by PCR introduced an artificial
HaeIII site in the PCR product only for the normal allele.
PCR was performed in a volume of 50 gI containing 50
ng DNA, 160 gM of each dNTP, 50 ng each of the
primers 9035 and 3273, and 0.5 U Dynazyme DNA polymerase in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer (Finnzymes, Helsinki) for 32 cycles at 95 °C, 52 °C, and 72
°C for one minute each. A 20 ,ud aliquot of the PCR
product was digested at 37 °C with 4 U HaeIII, and then
analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide
gel. Digestion of the PCR products with HaeIII-generated
fragments of lengths 167 and 20 bp in size for the normal
allele, whereas the mutant allele remained undigested.
Primers for the detection of the FH-Pori (T1202-+A) were
4497 (5'-CCCAGGCTCCATCGCCTAGC) and 2560
(5'-GACCACGTTCCTCAGGTTGG-3'). PCR was performed as for the FH-Turku mutation with the temperature profile of 95°C, 55°C, and 72°C for 1 min each. The
normal allele was digested by the restriction enzyme AluI,
while the mutant remained undigested when analyzed by
12% PAGE. For the missense mutations in exon 4, the
same upstream primer 4737 (5'-TGGTCTCGGCCATCCATCCC-3') was used. The downstream primer 4790
(5'-GTCAGAlFflGTCCTTGGAGT-3') introduced an
artificial Hinfl site in the PCR product only for the normal allele, while the Hinfl site was absent in the FH-Fin3 (G661-.T) gene. For the assay of the FH-Fin-4 mutation
(G665-+A), an artificial PstI site was introduced to the
normal allele by PCR with the primer 4694 (5'-CCTCGTCAGAFITGTCCCTG-3'). The conditions for PCR
and electrophoresis were the same as those for the FHPori mutation. Presence of the FH-Helsinki and FHNorth Karelia mutations of the LDL receptor was assayed
using the multiplex PCR method described elsewhere
(U.-M. Koivisto et al. 1993).

the patient's sequence with an equal intensity to the
corresponding G band in the normal allele at nucleotide
position 2533, indicating that one of the two alleles in
the patient has a adenine-for-guanine substitution (fig.
1B). This nucleotide substitution is predicted to result
in a change from an uncharged glycine to a negatively
charged aspartic acid at residue 823 of the LDL receptor
protein. The mean (± SD) serum total, LDL, and HDL
cholesterol, as well as triglyceride concentrations, in the
eight probands were 12.4 ± 1.5, 10.4 + 1.4, 1.4
+ 04, and 1.5 ± 0.7 mmol/liter, respectively, which
were not significantly different from those in heterozygous FH patients with the FH-Helsinki or North Karelia
genes (Koivisto et al. 1992). The exon 17 mutation was
subsequently designated as FH-Turku (see below).

screened for the presence of FH-Helsinki and FH-North
Karelia mutations (Koivisto et al. 1992). In contrast to
the other parts of Finland, prevalence of these two mutations in the southwestern area of Finland was significantly less than the average of 67%, suggesting the enrichment of another type of LDL receptor gene
mutations in this region. Our current study was undertaken to identify any additional Finnish type FH-mutations from the remaining unrelated Finnish families with
an unidentified LDL receptor gene mutation and to investigate if any of these would be preferentially enriched
among southwestern Finns.
The genomic DNA of the 46 probands was initially
analyzed by Southern blot technique with three restriction endonucleases and two cDNA fragments as probes
(Aalto-Setala et al. 1992), to exclude the possibility of
any major gene rearrangements. In the SSCP analysis,
we identified aberrant migration of the labeled DNA
strands in the samples of 18 patients. In each case, only
1 of the 18 exons revealed a characteristic mobility shift.
The aberrantly migrating PCR fragments were sequenced, and sequence alterations were identified.
Identification of the Exon 17 Mutation

SSCP analysis disclosed eight families with an identical aberrant band shift in exon 17 (fig. 1A). The exon
17-containing region was amplified from all eight FH
patients with the abnormal SSCP pattern in exon 17 and
directly sequenced. In each case, an extra A appeared in

Identification of Other Mutations

In addition to the exon 17 mutation, nine other LDL
receptor mutations were identified, including two nonsense mutations, six missense mutations, and a single
13-bp deletion (table 1). Both nonsense mutations were
found in the ligand binding area of the gene: a thymidine-for-guanine substitution converts codon 80 to a
stop codon in exon 3 (fig. 2A), while in exon 6 a adenine-for-guanine substitution results in a stop codon at
position 284 (fig. 3). Missense mutations in the ligand
binding area of the gene included two base substitutions in exon 4: a guanine-to-thymidine transition causing a negatively charged aspartic acid to be replaced
by an uncharged tyrosine at codon 200 (fig. 2C), and
a guanine-to-adenine transition changing a sulfhydrylcontaining cysteine to a hydroxyl-containing tyrosine
at codon 201 (fig. 2D). In the epidermal growth factor
homology domain, one patient displayed a guanine-toadenine transition resulting in the substitution of serine
for glycine at codon 375 in the exon 8 (fig. 2E). An
adenine-for-thymidine substitution causing a nonpolar
leucine to be replaced by a positively charged histidine
in codon 380 in exon 9 was detected in two unrelated
FH patients (fig. 2F) and designated as FH-Pori, while
an adenine-for-cytosine substitution changing aspartic
acid to glutamine in codon 424 was detected in one
patient (fig. 2G). In exon 10, an adenine-for-guanine
substitution converting an uncharged glycine to a positively charged arginine was detected in one patient
(fig. 2H).
The only deletion detected was found in a patient
who displayed a mobility shift, as well as a heteroduplex, on an SSCP gel in exon 4. The subcloned mutant allele displayed a 13-bp deletion extending from
nt 1325 to nt 1337 (fig. 2B). This deletion is predicted
to result in a translational frameshift after threonine
87 and introduces a premature stop codon at amino
acid 179.

because of the presence of another MboH site immediately
adjacent to the mutated site. None of the other mutations
created new or abolished existing restriction sites in any of
the 18 exons of the LDL receptor gene. Therefore, family
studies were carried out either by using direct sequencing
(fig. 3) or by introducing artificial restriction-enzyme recognition site in the PCR product of a given exon that was

in more than one family. All of the eight probands with
the FH-Turku gene were from the Helsinki or southwestern regions of Finland. There were two probands
with the FH-Pori mutation, one coming from the city
of Pori, in southwestern Finland, and the other from the
Helsinki area. Because our previous study was compatible with the assumption that one mutation type other
than the FH-Helsinki or FH-North Karelia gene may be
enriched in the southwestern Finland (Koivisto et al.
1992), we expanded the cohort of clinically unequivocal
cases of unrelated FH probands from this geographical
origin to 39 patients. Most of these patients lived in the
city of Turku on the southwestern coast of Finland. In
this group as a whole, we identified nine (23%) probands with the FH-Helsinki gene, eight (21%) probands
with the FH-Turku gene, four (10%) probands with the
FH-North Karelia gene, and three (8%) probands with
the FH-Pori gene.
Table 2 summarizes the prevalences of the common
and rare mutations of the LDL receptor gene in the
whole of Finland. The newly described FH-Turku gene
was most prevalent among the FH patients from the
southwestern part of Finland (see above) and was present in 6% of patients from the Helsinki region. Neither
of the two common point mutations, FH-Turku or FHPori, were found in any patient living in the northern
and eastern parts of Finland. Altogether, the four common Finnish-type FH genes (FH-Helsinki, FH-North
Karelia, FH-Turku, and FH-Pori) account for -75% of
the LDL receptor gene mutation spectrum in Finland.
This should be considered a minimum estimate because
some of the 38 patients with the yet unknown class of
mutations (table 2) may in fact have a disease other
than familial hypercholesterolemia. There are marked
geographical differences in the frequency of the four
common FH genes among patients from various parts
of the country (fig. 5).

absent in the mutated gene (see Subjects and Methods). The
principle of the PCR-PIRA assay of the FRH-Turku mutation
is illustrated in figure 4.
Family studies were carried out with all the mutations
listed in table 1, with the exception of the FRH-Fin-8
mutation, in which case family members were not available for examination. In every case, cosegregation of the
mutant allele with hypercholesterolemia was demonstrated. None of the mutations were detected in a panel

This paper describes 10 previously unreported mutations of the LDL receptor gene that all were associated
with a typical clinical phenotype of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Although an unequivocal demonstration of a causal role for the seven missense mutations (table 1) would require expression of the mutant
genes in mammalian cells followed by functional studies
of the encoded receptors, several arguments favor their
pathogenetic significance. First, six of the seven missense

mutations will result in charge alterations of the amino
acid residue involved (table 1). The only exception is
the FH-Fin-6 mutation replacing the uncharged glycine
with another uncharged residue, serine. Second, cosegregation of the mutant allele with the clinical phenotype of familial hypercholesterolemia was demonstrated
in all but one families investigated. Third, none of the
ten mutations was identified when their occurrence was
tested among a collection of 100 LDL receptor alleles
from the normal Finnish population.
The present study indicates the feasibility of the SSCP
technique (Orita et al. 1989) in mutation scanning. Of
the 10 mutations detected, 9 were single-nucleotide alterations. Our inability to find distinct SSCP signals in
many samples may reflect the inherent limitations of the
SSCP analysis. It is also possible that we have missed
mutations that are located close to the intron-exon
boundaries of LDL receptor gene, because PCR primers
were derived from the exon-flanking sequences of the
17 introns (Leitersdorf et al. 1990). Alternatively, some
of the unknown type of mutations may affect the structure of the introns themselves. Finally, although the pres-

(tyrosine 824) is yet to be examined by overexpression of the mutant receptor in polarized epithelial
cells. During our previously published study, in which
we

examined LDL

binding and internalization of fibropatients with and without the

blasts from Finnish FR

FR-Helsinki gene (Aalto-Setala et al. 1989), three heterozygous patients with the FH-Turku gene were in-

cluded

in the

ternalization,

analyses; the mean values for binding, inand degradation of radiolabeled LDL

particles were 62 ± 12%, 49 ± 13%, and 49 ± 10
%, respectively, of those measured for fibroblasts from

normal controls. If the FH-Turku mutation would affect
the basolateral sorting process only, it should not significantly impair the binding of LDL particles by nonpolarized cells such as fibroblasts. It is thus possible that the
FH-Turku mutation could result in defective receptor
function by other mechanisms, such as by alterations in
mRNA stability, rate of receptor degradation, or improper dimerization of the receptors.
The FH-Pori mutation substitutes a positively charged
histidine for a neutral leucine at position 380 located in
aminoterminal portion of the epidermal growth-factor
homology region of the LDL receptor gene. Missense
mutations of the exon 9 have been reported to result
almost invariably in recycling-defective (class 5) receptor
molecules (Hobbs et al. 1992). The detailed functional
consequences of the FH-Pori mutation are yet to be explored.
By an apparent founder gene effect, particular mutations of the LDL receptor gene have been enriched in
several non-European populations including the French
Canadians (Hobbs et al. 1987; Leitersdorf et al. 1990),
South African Afrikaners (Leitersdorf et al. 1989), and
a number of Christian, Jewish, and Arab sects living in
the Middle East (Lehrman et al. 1987; Meiner et al.
1991; Landsberger et al. 1992; Leitersdorf et al. 1993).
The spectrum of mutations is much more variable in
most European countries (Schuster and Humphries
1994). Although four different rearrangements of the
LDL receptor gene account for 17% of the mutations
in the Dutch FH patients (Top et al. 1990) and a group
of different large rearrangements or small DNA alterations collectively reach up to 20% of the mutations
among FH patients in United Kingdom (Gudnason et al.
1993), the remainder may mostly represent rare alleles
varying from family to family. A specific point mutation
Pro664-Leu was present in many FH probands from
both the United Kingdom (King-Underwood et al. 1991)
and The Netherlands (Defesche et al. 1992), but its coverage in the total material did not exceed 1%-2% in
either case. As to the Nordic countries, two apparent
founder mutations, together accounting for -33% of
FH cases in Norway, were recently identified (Leren et
al. 1994), whereas no commonly occurring mutant LDL
receptor genes have been reported in Sweden or Denmark, to date.
The molecular genetic background of FH in Finland
is peculiar, a fact apparently reflecting anthropological,
cultural, and linguistic separation from other European
populations. The exact root of the present-day Finns is
a matter of debate (Huurre 1990). Two facts have been
established with certainty: first, Finland had inhabitants
during the stone and bronze age, even thousands of years
before the Christian era; and second, an important wave
of settlement originating from the present Baltic area
took place during the first centuries C.E. According to
