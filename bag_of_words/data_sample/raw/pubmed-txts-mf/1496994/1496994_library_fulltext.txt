Summary
Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by a partial deficiency of
porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase. Different subtypes of the disease have been defined, and more than 10
different mutations have been described. We focused our study on exon 10, since we previously found that
three different mutations were located in this exon and that two of them seemed to be relatively common.
We used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) after in vitro amplification to detect all possible
mutations in exon 10 in 41 unrelated AIP patients. In about one-fourth of these patients we could distinguish
three abnormal migration patterns, indicating the presence of various mutations. Additional sequencing
demonstrated the presence of three different single-base substitutions. Two of these mutations had already
been described. A third one consisted of a C-to-T transition located at position 499 of the PBG deaminase
mRNA and resulted in an Arg-to-Trp substitution. All three mutations were found in patients with crossreacting immunological material (CRIM)-positive forms of AIP. The high frequency of these mutations make
DGGE analysis of exon 10 a useful approach allowing the direct detection of the DNA abnormality in most
of the families with the CRIM-positive subtype of AIP.

Introduction
Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an autosomal
dominant disease which is defined by a partial de-

ficiency of porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase (hydroxymethylbilane synthase; E.C.4.3.1.8), the third
enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway. The clinical manifestations are characterized by acute attacks
of neurological dysfunctions, with abdominal pains,
hypertension, tachycardia, and peripheral neuropathy
(Kappas et al. 1989).
The molecular heterogeneity of the mutations producing AIP was suggested by DNA studies at the PBG

deaminase locus, which demonstrated that AIP mutations were associated with different restriction haplotypes (Llewellyn et al. 1987; Lee et al. 1988; Scobie et
al. 1990). We have previously identified two different
mutations in exon 1 of the PBG deaminase gene, accounting for a subgroup of AIP families in which the
expression of the enzymatic defect is restricted to nonerythropoietic cells (Grandchamp et al. 1989b, 1989c).
Moreover, several phenotypic subtypes at the protein
level have been described. In the more common forms
of AIP, in which the PBG deaminase deficiency is present in all cell types, different investigators have documented the existence of two subgroups of patients on
the basis of measurement of cross-reacting immunological material (CRIM) in erythrocytes, groups referred to as "CRIM-negative" and "CRIM-positive"
mutations (Desnick et al. 1985; De Rooij et al. 1987).
Recent studies in our laboratory identified two mutations responsible for CRIM-positive forms of the

Mutations in Exon 10 of PBG Deaminase Gene

disease (Delfau et al. 1990). These single-base substitutions, both located in exon 10 of the PBG deaminase
gene, accounted for the enzymatic abnormality in six
of eight patients with this subtype of AIP. In the
CRIM-negative group, five different mutations were
described, and each of them was detected in only one
family (Scobie et al. 1990; Delfau et al. 1991). One of
these mutations is also located in exon 10. The high
frequency of mutations in exon 10 of the PBG deaminase gene prompted us to establish the overall frequency of the mutations located in this exon in AIP
patients. For this purpose, we used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) as a mean of detecting
all possible mutations in this exon after in vitro DNA
amplification (Sheffield et al. 1989).
Patients and Methods
Patients
A total of 41 unrelated patients from The Netherlands were studied. All of them were AIP patients with
unknown mutations, 10 patients with CRIM-positive
and 31 with CRIM-negative forms of AIP. The diagnosis was established on the basis of clinical symptoms
of the disease accompanied by increased urinary excretion of PBG and 5-aminolevulinic acid and by normal
fecal porphyrin excretion. Diminished activity of PBG
deaminase was also observed in erythrocytes of these
patients. CRIM determination was performed according to a method described elsewhere (De Rooij et
al. 1987; Grandchamp et al. 1989a).
DNA Amplification

DNA was prepared from peripheral blood leukocyte samples according to the method of Higuchi
(1989). DNA amplifications were carried out using
the PCR according to the method of Saiki et al. (1988).
DNA samples were amplified in 50-gl reaction mixtures containing 200 ng of genomic DNA, 50 mmol
KCl/liter, 10 mmol Tris pH 8.3/liter, 1.5 mmol
MgCl2/liter, 0.2 mmol dATP/liter, 0.2 mmol dCTP/
liter, 0.2 mmol dGTP/liter, 0.2 mmol dTTP/liter, 25
pmol of each primer, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase
(Stratagene). The cycling reaction was performed in a
programmable heating block (DNA thermal reactor;
Hybaid). The DNA samples were initially denatured
for 3 min at 95°C, and then, with each cycle consisting
of 15 s at 95°C, 30 s at 56°C, and 40 s at 72°C,
the PCR was carried out for 30 cycles. To allow the
formation of heteroduplexes, the incubation mixture

661

was heated at 95°C for 5 min and was allowed to
reanneal for 5 min at 72°C after completion of the last
cycle. Two primers were designed to match a genomic
sequence in intron 9 for the sense primer (Phi9, 5'CCGACACTGTGGTCCTTAGCAA-3') and in intron 10 for the antisense primer with the addition of
a 30-base clamp (PhilO clamp, 5'-CGCCCGGCGGCCCTCCCGCGGGCGGCGGGCTGGGGATGACTGTAAGGCAGAA-3'), allowing the amplification of
a 240-bp segment containing exon 10 of the PBG deaminase gene.
DGGE

DGGE was performed according to the method of
Myers et al. (1987). Computer analyses were carried
out using Melt 87 meltmap programs according to
the method of Lerman and Silverstein (1987). Each
amplified sample (15 gl) was mixed with loading
buffer and electrophoresed in an 8% polyacrylamide
gel with a linear gradient of 50%-80% denaturant
(100% denaturant = 7 mol/liter urea/40% formamide) at 150 V for 3 h. The gel was stained in
ethidium bromide and was photographed under UV
light with Polaroid film type 667.
DNA Sequencing

Direct DNA sequencing was carried out after PCR
amplification, according to a method described by
Hutman et al. (1989). Primers used for amplification
were Phi9 and PhilO (without clamp), the former
primer being biotinylated. After amplification, singlestranded DNA was obtained by mixing 25 pl of PCR
products with 30 pl of Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin
(Dynal, Norway), denaturing the DNA with 0.15 mol
NaOH/liter, and washing twice with water. Sequencing was performed using a sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemical). The sequencing primer was the same as
the amplification primer (PhilO), and internal labeling
was obtained with a-35 S-dATP (Amersham).
Site-directed Mutagenesis
A normal human cDNA sequence cloned in the plasmid vector PGEM3 (Promega Biotech) was modified
to introduce the C-to-T mutation at position 499 (see
Results) by using site-directed mutagenesis. The PCR
was performed according to a method described by
Higuchi (1990), except that the thermostable polymerase pfu (Stratagene) was used instead of Taq polymerase. In brief, two partially overlapping fragments
were synthesized using two sets of primers, one primer
from each pair targeting the desired sequence to be

changed. The following sets of primers were used:
PheNco, 5'-ATGTCTGGTAACGGCAATGCGG-3'
and Phe499AS, 5'-GGTTTCCCCGAATACTCCT-3';
and Phe499, 5'-AGGAGTATTCGGGGAAACCTCA-3' and Phel 5Hind, 5'-CATCTGTGCCCCACAAACCA-3'. The reaction mixtures contained 1 ng of
plasmid, 25 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mmol each
dNTP/liter, and 1 unit of pfu polymerase (Stratagene)
in 50 1 of 1 x buffer 1 from the manufacturer.
After an initial denaturation for 3 min at 940C, 30
cycles of PCR were performed, each cycle consisting
of 15 s at 950C, 1 min 30 s at 440C, and 1 min 10 s
at 720 C. The resulting PCR products were gel purified
on a 3 % Nusieve gel and were mixed in a 1:1 molar
ratio, and about 5 ng of each fragment was added to
a reaction mixture of 50 gl containing containing 1 x
buffer 1 (Statagene), 0.2 mmol each dNTP/liter, and
1 unit of pfu DNA polymerase. After five cycles, each
consisting of 15 s at 950C, 1 min at 48°C, and 1 min
30 s at 72°C, primers PheNco and Phel5Hind were
added (25 pmol each), and the PCR was allowed to
process for 25 additional cycles, each consisting of
15 s at 95°C, 40 s at 55°C, and 1 min 40 s at 72°C.
Bacterial Expression of PBG Deaminase
cDNA fragments were phenol extracted and ethanol
precipitated. The purified fragments were digested
with NcoI and HindIll, were purified through spundown chromatography using Sephacryl S200, and
were cloned into the bacterial expression vector PKK
233-2. The sequence of cloned cDNA was verified,
and PBG deaminase activity was determined from bacterial cultures according to a method described elsewhere (Delfau et al. 1990). Both separation of normal
and mutated human PBG deaminase from the enzyme
from Escherichia coli and western blot analysis were
performed according to methods described elsewhere
(Delfau et al. 1990).
Results
A rapid screening for the presence of mutations in
exon 10 of the PBG deaminase gene was performed by
DNA analysis of 41 unrelated AIP patients from The
Netherlands by using PCR amplification and subsequent DGGE analysis of the PCR products. The melting map of this fragment is represented on figure 1. Of
the 41 patients that we studied, 8 gave rise to amplified
products with an abnormal melting pattern (fig. 2 and
data not shown). In each case, in addition to a band

tions could be detected. The nature of these mutations
was determined by direct sequencing of amplified
products. Two mutations consisted of G-to-A transitions, one at position 500 and one at position 518 of
the coding sequence of the PBG deaminase mRNA.
Such mutations had previously been found in other
patients in our laboratory (Delfau et al. 1990). In the
present study, six patients had the mutation at position 500, and two had the mutation at position 518.
A previously undescribed type of mutation was found
in another patient and consisted of a C-to-T transition
at position 499 of the open reading frame, resulting in
an arginine-to-tryptophan amino acid substitution in
the abnormal protein. The same mutation was also
detected in two relatives of the patient. In order to
evaluate the functional consequences of this mutation,
the base change was introduced into a normal cDNA
sequence by site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutated cDNA was cloned in the expression plasmid PKK
233-2. Of 10 clones that we tested, all of them failed
to express the human enzyme activity, although clones
containing the normal cDNA overexpressed PBG deaminase activity. After verification of its nucleotide
sequence, one mutated cDNA clone was further studied. The specific activity of the abnormal enzyme was
4% of the normal human PBG deaminase activity
(mean of four independent determinations) when measured at the optimal pH of the normal enzyme (pH 8).
A western blot analysis of the bacterial proteins by
using a specific antiserum against PBG deaminase revealed the presence of a stable immunoreactive enzyme (fig. 3). All the patients whom we found with a
mutation in exon 10 during the present study presented CRIM-positive forms of AIP (table 1), and,
conversely, only 2 of 10 patients with the same subtype
of the disease had no abnormality in this exon; in these
2 patients, the absence of a base change in exon 10
was confirmed by direct sequencing of PCR products.
In the CRIM-negative group, none of the patients presented any detectable abnormality in exon 10.

Discussion

Previous work has indicated that AIP is a heterogeneous disease at the molecular level and that point
mutations, rather than large deletions, are likely to
account for most of the cases (Llewellyn et al. 1987).
Eleven different mutations have already been identified (Grandchamp et al. 1989a, 1989b, 1989c; Delfau
et al. 1990, 1991; Scobie et al. 1990). All known
mutations are readily detectable by hybridization of

PCR-amplified genomic sequences by allele-specific
oligonucleotides. However, the efficiency of this approach is limited by the extent of the heterogeneity of
the mutations. For this reason, we used DGGE as an
alternative approach to detect all possible mutations
in a defined DNA fragment after PCR amplification
(Myers et al. 1987; Sheffield et al. 1989). Elsewhere
we have used this method to detect mutations in exon

1 of the PBG deaminase gene (Bourgeois et al. 1992).
The major advantages of the DGGE approach are its
simplicity, since neither hybridization nor enzymatic
digestion is required, and, most important, the possible ability to detect mutations in the domain under
investigation, mutations which may be different from
already known mutations. About one-fourth of the
unrelated patients whom we studied by DGGE yielded
an abnormal pattern of migration and were shown to
carry single-base substitutions in exon 10. Two of
these mutations have already been described (Delfau et
al. 1990). A third one consisted of a C-to-T transition
located at position 499 of the PBG deaminase mRNA
and changed the same codon as did the previously
described G-to-A transition at position 500. The functional consequences of this base change were further
investigated by introducing the 499 mutation into a
normal PBG deaminase cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis and then cloning the mutated cDNA into a
bacterial expression vector. As previously reported for
other CRIM-positive mutations (Delfau et al. 1990),
the abnormal cDNA was able to direct the synthesis
of an immunodetectable but catalytically inactive protein in the bacterial system. All three mutations reported here were found in patients with CRIMpositive forms of AIP. Only two other patients with
the same phenotypic subtype of the disease had no
abnormality of exon 10. CRIM-positive mutations
have been found in 15%-25% of AIP families (Desnick et al. 1985; De Rooij et al. 1987; present study).
It is noteworthy that the newly found mutation leads
to an arginine-to-tryptophan amino acid change in the
mutated protein, involving the same arginine as does
the G-to-A transition located at position 500. This
confirms the importance of this amino acid residue for
the catalytic activity of the enzyme. This role may
involve the binding of either PBG or one of the poly-

pyrrole intermediates during the stepwise polymerization of four PBG molecules. It is of interest that this
arginine is highly conserved between species for which
sequence data are available, including rat, mouse,
Escherichia coli, and Euglena gracilis (Thomas and Jordan 1986; Stubnicer et al. 1988; Beaumont et al.
1989; Sharif et al. 1989). Other lines of evidence suggest that arginine residues may be involved in substrate
binding in other enzymes of the heme biosynthetic
pathway (Dailey et al. 1986). Taken together with
previous results from our laboratory (Delfau et al.
1990), our data suggest that a large majority of
CRIM-positive patients (12 of 16 patients) have
single-base substitution in exon 10 of the PBG deaminase gene, with a higher frequency of the G-to-A transition at position 500 (10 patients). However, since
the majority of the patients in our studies originated
from The Netherlands and from France, the frequency
of these mutations must be evaluated in CRIM-positive patients from different origins. In the CRIMnegative forms of AIP, most of the mutations reported
so far consist of point mutations resulting in single
amino acid changes (Delfau et al. 1990, 1991), premature stop codons (Scobie et al. 1990), or splicing defects (Grandchamp et al. 1989a, 1989b, and 1989c).
Such mutations could potentially be detected by using
DGGE analysis of PCR products containing different
exons and exon-intron junctions of the gene. This will
allow evaluation of the extent of the diversity of the
mutations responsible for AIP.
