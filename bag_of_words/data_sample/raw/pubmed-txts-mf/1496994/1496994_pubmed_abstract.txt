Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by a partial deficiency of porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase. Different subtypes of the disease have been defined, and more than 10 different mutations have been described. We focused our study on exon 10, since we previously found that three different mutations were located in this exon and that two of them seemed to be relatively common. We used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) after in vitro amplification to detect all possible mutations in exon 10 in 41 unrelated AIP patients. In about one-fourth of these patients we could distinguish three abnormal migration patterns, indicating the presence of various mutations. Additional sequencing demonstrated the presence of three different single-base substitutions. Two of these mutations had already been described. A third one consisted of a C-to-T transition located at position 499 of the PBG deaminase mRNA and resulted in an Arg-to-Trp substitution. All three mutations were found in patients with cross-reacting immunological material (CRIM)-positive forms of AIP. The high frequency of these mutations make DGGE analysis of exon 10 a useful approach allowing the direct direction of the DNA abnormality in most of the families with the CRIM-positive subtype of AIP.
