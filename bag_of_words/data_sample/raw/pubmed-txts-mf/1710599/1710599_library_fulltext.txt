1991). The polypeptide predicted from completely sequenced cDNA consists of 1480 amino acids and it is
named cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR). On the basis of its remarkable sequence and structural similarity to many ATP-dependent transport proteins, it has been generally assumed that CFTR contains two highly hydrophobic
transmembrane regions, each followed by two nucleotide-binding folds (NBFs) (Riordan et al., 1989).
A deletion of 3 bp in exon 10 of the CFTR gene,
which results in the loss of a phenylalanine residue at
amino acid position 508 (AF508), is the most common
mutation causing CF, accounting for approximately
70% of the CF chromosomes (Kerem et al., 1989b;
Lemna et al., 1990). A large number of other mutations have also been identified in the CFTR gene
(Cutting et al., 1990a,b; Dean et al., 1990; Kerem et uZ.,
1990a; Vidaud et al., 1990; Guillermit et al., 1990;
White et al., 1990), but most of them are rare in the
population. These include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and RNA splicing mutations. Since the
searches have been concentrated mostly on the two
NBFs, many of the known mutations are also located
in these regions.
We have initiated a systematic analysis of all the
CF chromosomes in our cohort of Canadian families
(Tsui et al., 1986) and have reported mutations in the
two NBFs (Kerem et al., 1990b). Since each of the CF
chromosomes is characterized by extensive DNA
marker haplotype (Kerem et al., 1989b), they may
serve as excellent references for future population
analysis. To continue our identification of disease-relevant mutations for delineation of the function of
CFTR, we have screened the first eight exons of the
gene by direct sequence analysis of genomic DNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Saiki
et al., 1988). In this communication, we report five
(possibly six) apparent mutations within exons 1
through 8 of the CFTR gene.

Five different mutations have been identified in the gene
causing cystic fibrosis (CF) through sequencing regions encompassing
exons 1-8, including
the 5’ untranslated
leader. Two of these apparent mutations are missense mutations, one in exon 3 (Gly to Glu at position 85; GSBE) and
another in exon 5 (Gly to Arg at 178; G178R), both causing
significant changes in the corresponding
amino acids in the
encoded proteincystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator
(CFTR). Two others affect the highly conserved RNA splice junction flanking the 3’ end of exons 4
and5(621+1G+T,711+1G+T),resultinginaprobable splicing defect. The last mutation is a single-basepair
deletion in exon 4, causing a frameshift.
These five mutations account for the 9 of 31 non-AF508
CF chromosomes
in our Canadian
CF family collection
and they are not
found in any of the normal chromosomes. Three of the mutations, 621+ 1G + T, 711+ lG+T,andG85E,arefound
in the French-Canadian
population,
with 621 + 1G --t T
being the most abundant
(5/7). There are two other sequence variations in the CFTR gene; one of them (129G --*
C) is located 4 nucleotides upstream of the proposed translation initiation
codon and, although present only on CF
chromosomes, it is not clear whether it is a disease-causing
mutation; the other (R75Q) is most likely a sequence variation within the coding region.

METHODS

Samples

The 46 Canadian CF families used in this study had
been previously
described (Tsui et al., 1986). Extensive DNA marker haplotype information
for the CF
chromosomes
in these families was available (Kerem
et al., 1989b). Peripheral blood samples were also collected from additional
CF patients
and family
members registered at the CF clinic of the Hospital
for Sick Children. Informed consent was obtained for
each participating
individual, and blood samples were
collected according to procedures
approved by the
HSC Human Subjects Review Committee.
The pancreatic status of patients was defined as described
(Kerem et al., 1990b). Data for one of the families
(Toronto 17) reported here were deposited at the Human Genetic Mutant
Cell Repository
at Camden,
New Jersey (GM1076). The criteria for diagnosis of
pancreatic status were described (Gaskin et aZ., 1984;
Durie et al., 1986; Kerem et al., 1989a).

Methods

Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed
as described (Winship, 1989; Kerem et al., 1990a).
The PCR primers B115-B, lOD, Zi-5, 3i-3, 4i-3, 5i-3,
6Ai-3,6Ci-3, ?i-5,8i-3, as described in the accompanying paper (Zielenski et al., 1991), were used for sequencing. An internal primer for exon 1 (primer A;
5’-CAAGTGCATAGTAGCGTACT-3’)
was used.
Allele-Specific Oligonucleotide (ASO) Hybridization
The oligonucleotide hybridization conditions have
been previously described (Kerem et al., 1989b). The
normal and mutant-specific
oligonucleotides are
listed in Table 1. The hybridization was performed at
37°C and the washings were done twice with 5~ SSC

DNA sequences spanning individual exons were

used for the amplification of individual exon sequences have been described (Zielenski et at., 1991).
Oligonucleotides were either purchased from the Hospital for Sick Children DNA Biotechnology Service
Center or synthesized with the use of a Cruachem
PS250 machine. PCR amplification of genomic DNA
from cultured lymphoblasts or peripheral blood was
performed in a Perkin-Elmer/Cetus
DNA thermal
cycler as described (Kerem et al., 1990a), except for
exons 1 and 2 for which a modified protocol was used
(Zielenski et al., 1991).

RESULTS

As an ongoing effort to screen for mutations in the
CFTR gene, 18 unrelated individuals (including 4 patients and 14 obligate carriers) carrying 20 nonAF508 CF chromosomes were used as the primary
panel for DNA sequence analysis. These chromosomes were chosen because their haplotypes, consisting of 23 DNA markers spanning the entire gene, were
available for comparative analysis (Kerem et al.,
1989b). In the present study, direct DNA sequencing
of PCR-amplified product was performed on the first
eight exons of the CFTR gene, which included the
region extending from 5’ of the presumptive promoter
of the gene to sequences flanking the 3’ end of exon 8.
A total of seven nucleotide alterations, compared to
the published cDNA sequence, was noted (Table 2).
Each of the changes was verified by repeated sequencing and confirmed with a specific diagnostic test (as
indicated below) in other family members.

A missense mutation was found in exon 3, in a region corresponding to the predicted transmembrane

ily 17, GM1076) heterozygous
for this deletion; overlapping ladders were thus observed on the sequencing
gel from the point of the deletion (Fig. 1). The
556delA deletion was thought to be disease-causing
because it would result in a shift of translation
reading frame leading to a premature
termination
of
CFTR synthesis.
The mutant chromosome
was classified as a member of the IIIb haplotype group, and
the paternal CF chromosome in this family was found
to have the AF508 mutation (Kerem et al., 198913).
Since 556delA created a novel BgZI site in exon 4,
the PCR-amplified
product could be digested with
BgZI to distinguish the mutant sequence, which would
be cleaved by this enzyme into two fragments
(287
and 150 bp), from the normal (438 bp) (Table 1). The
mutation was not found in 31 other CF chromosomes
(9 from group IIIb) and 30 normal chromosomes
(16
from IIIb) .
621 i- 1G --+ T
A putative mutation was found in the splice donor
site flanking the 3’ end of exon 4; the highly conserved
GT at this location was changed to TT (Fig. 1). This
mutation (621 + 1G + T), which was expected to
result in aberrant
splicing,
was detected in five
French-Canadian
non-AF508
CF chromosomes
belonging to haplotype group I (one each in Toronto
families 22, 23,26,36, and 53) but not in 33 other CF
chromosomes
(18 from the same group) and 29 normal chromosomes
(13 from the same group). The

enzyme

other CF chromosomes
in all five families were also
known: the ones for families 23 and 36 were AF508,
that for family 53 was A455E (Kerem et aZ., 1990a),
that for family 26 was G85E (as described above), and
that for family 22 was 711+ 1G + T (see below). The
patients in these families, except those in family 53,
were all documented to be PI.
Since a novel We1 site was created by this G to T
transversion,
the mutant allele could be distinguished
from the non-621 + 1G + T sequence with this enzyme; whereas four fragments of 33,35,71, and 299 bp
in size would be generated by MseI digestion of the
normal PCR-amplified
product, the 299-bp fragment
in the mutant would be cleaved by the enzyme to give
two fragments of 54 and 245 bp instead.
G178R
A missense mutation (G178R) was detected in exon
5, in a region predicted to be intracellular,
and between the first and second membrane-spanning
segments. The nucleotide at position 664 was changed
from G to A (Fig. l), resulting in the replacement of
Gly178 by Arg in the presumptive
CFTR. The mutation was found to belong to haplotype group V, on the
maternal CF chromosome
in family 50. The patients
in this family were classified as PI, and the paternal
CF chromosome
was AF508.
G178R could be identified with AS0 hybridization,
as described in Table 1. This G to A transition
was
thought to be a mutation causing CF because the en-

MUTATIONS

coded amino acid residue switched
from neutral to
basic. No other sequence alterations were found in the
coding region of this allele. In addition, the sequence
variation was not detected in 54 normal chromosomes
(including 5 in the same haplotype group); it was, in
fact, found only once after screening of 61 CF chromosomes (including 2 others from the same group).

711 + 1G + T
This G to T change was found to be located at the
highly conserved
consensus
sequence at the splice
junction (nucleotide position 711+ 1) at the 3’ flanking region of exon 5 (Fig. 1). As a consequence, it was
expected that this change (GT + TT) would result in
aberrant splicing. The 711 + 1G --* T mutation was
found on the maternal CF chromosome
of a FrenchCanadian family with PI (family 22) from Chicoutimi;
this chromosome was included in haplotype group 1%
The 711 + 1G --) T mutation could be detected by
AS0 hybridization
as described in Table 1. We examined 54 CF chromosomes
(9 from haplotype group II)
and 49 normal chromosomes
(41 group II), but did not
see another example.

129G + C
While all of the presumptive
CF mutations identified thus far were located in the coding region and
RNA splice junctions
(Kerem et al., 1989b, 1990a;
Cutting et al., 1990a,b; Dean et al., 1990; White et al.,
1990), one candidate mutation outside these regions
was found at a nucleotide position 4 bp upstream of
the presumptive
initiation codon. The sequence alteration was a G to C transversion
(129G + C). It was
first found on the paternal CF chromosome
in Toronto family 14 and associated with haplotype IIa.
The CF children in this family were documented to be
PS (pancreatic sufficient) and the maternal CF chromosome was AF508. The 129G + C mutation could
be detected by AS0 hybridization
as described in Table 1.
Haplotype
analysis indicated that haplotype
IIa
(the chromosome containing this mutation) was common among the normal chromosome
population
(Kerem et al., 1989b), but the G to C change was not
found in 51 normal chromosomes
screened (43 from
group II). To obtain further
evidence that this sequence alteration
might associate with the disease,
additional chromosomes
were examined. Among 68
other CF chromosomes
(including 10 from haplotype
group II) analyzed, two additional
examples were
found in two unrelated PS patients. The other chromosomes in these patients were AF508 but, unfortunately, their haplotype was not determined.

R75Q
An alternative nucleotide was noted at position 356
in exon 3, where a T nucleotide was found in place of
the reported C (data not shown); the corresponding
amino acid would be Gln instead of Arg at amino acid
position 75. The T nucleotide was found in 5 of 16
normal chromosomes
of haplotype IIa but not in 17
normal chromosomes
of other haplotypes
nor in 41
CF chromosomes
(23 from IIa), suggesting that this
mutation
represents
an amino acid sequence polymorphism.
DISCUSSION

Upon sequence analysis of exons 1 through 8, we
have identified five, possibly six, different mutations
in the CFTR gene. Although one of them, 556delA
(the single-basepair deletion), which is expected to
create a translational frameshift, is clearly a defective
allele, the other five require further justification that
they are disease-causing mutations. The identification of this frameshift mutation, together with G85E,
confirms that the previously predicted initiation codon is in fact utilized, as the next available methionine codon is at amino acid position 150 toward the
end of exon 4.
Two of these apparent mutations (G85E and
G178R) would lead to drastic amino acid substitutions (change of type). Since Gly85 is predicted to be
in the first transmembrane segment of CFTR, replacement with a negatively charged residue (Glu) would
probably cause a severe consequence to the localization of the mutant protein in the membrane. The result of substituting Arg for Glyl78 is not as obvious,
as there is no information about a possible function of
this presumed intracellular region. However, since no
other sequence alterations have been detected in the
coding regions of these alleles and since no normal
chromosomes have been found to harbor these missense mutations, G85E and G178R are most probably
disease-causing mutations. Formal proof that these
sequence alterations are bona fide mutations awaits
functional testing of each of them in transfection assays. In this regard, the transfection systems recently
developed (Drumm et al., 1990; Rich et al., 1990)
should be useful for the study.
Two of the sequence changes (621 + 1G + T and
711 + 1G + T) are expected to cause RNA splicing
defects. The unprocessed or aberrantly processed
RNA may be highly unstable and rapidly degraded,
resulting in low or no CFTR synthesis. It is unclear,
however, whether alternative splicing might occur at
cryptic sites. Total omission of exon 4 or 5 is expected
to create a shortened polypeptide, as both of these
exons contain a number of nucleotides in multiples of

234

ZIELENSKI

3, but the resulting proteins might not be functional.
Direct examination
of the RNA or protein derived
from these mutant alleles should provide a better understanding
of these mutations.
The sequence change (129G --f C) located 4 nucleotides upstream of the proposed translation
initiation
codon is perplexing; it is unclear whether it represents
a disease-causing
mutation, especially since a C residue at position -4 of the initiation codon is preferred
in experimental
systems (Kozak,
1986). The mutation has, however, so far been found on 3 CF chromosomes but not on any of the 51 normal chromosomes
examined,
including
43 from the same haplotype
group (IIa). It is possible that there is a mutation elsewhere in this allele, but no other change has been
found after sequencing of the entire coding region and
immediately
flanking intron regions. Alternatively,
129G + C may reduce expression
of CFTR at the
transcriptional
level. Further analysis at the expression level may prove this point.
On the basis of DNA marker haplotype analysis, we
previously showed that all CF chromosomes
carrying
AF508 appear to have descended from a single mutational event (Kerem et al., 198913). A similar conclusion may be drawn for the 621 + 1G + T mutation
described
in this study; all the CF chromosomes
carrying this mutation belong to haplotype group Ib
(Fig. 2). In fact, the CF patients with 621 + 1G + T
all come from the Saguenay-Lac
St. Jean region in
Quebec, confirming the common origin of this mutation. It is probable that the mutation was introduced
into this historical
settlement by a small number of
founders (Bouchard,
1987). In this regard, it is of interest to note that another mutation, A455E, found in
this French-Canadian
population
is also associated
with haplotype Ib (Kerem et aZ., 1990a). Since group I
haplotype is rare among normal chromosomes,
it is
likely that 621+ 1G --* T, A455E, and perhaps AF508
(Kerem et aZ., 1989a) all originated in a unique geographic location. Subsequent selection or drift could
increase the frequencies of these mutations in the population. The two other mutations
(G85E and 711
+ 1G + T) found in the French-Canadian
population, although less frequently
detected, also share a
similar haplotype (group IIb, Fig. 2). This similarity
may reflect their common ancestral relationship,
but
it is more likely to be a coincidence, as group II is the
most common haplotype
among normal chromosomes (Kerem et aZ., 1989b).
We previously
suggested that CF mutations could
be classified as seuere and mild alleles with respect to
their influence on pancreatic function (Kerem et al.,
1989a,b). The AI?508 deletion has been included as
one of the severe alleles, and patients homozygous for
this mutation are almost exclusively PI (Kerem et al.,
1989b, 199Ob). The hypothesis
also predicts that pa-

tients homozygous for any combination
of the severe
alleles will be PI. Under this assumption, a number of
other mutations
could be classified as severe alleles
for their association
with PI patients (Kerem et al.,
1990a). Similarly, five of the mutations reported here,
i.e., G85E, G178R, 556delA, 621 + 1G + T, and 711
+ 1G --* T, could also be classified as severe alleles.
Definition
of a mild allele is less straightforward
because the patient could carry one or two copies of a
mild mutation(s).
Two mutations
(A455E
and
P574H) that are most likely mild alleles have been
described; both of them are found in patients carrying
AF508 (severe allele) as their other CF chromosome
(Kerem et al, 1990a). In the present study, one of
these mild alleles, A455E, is found in combination
with 621 + 1G + T (a severe allele as defined above)
in a PS patient, thus in complete agreement with our
hypothesis. Further, the CFTR gene with the 129G --t
C mutation probably constitutes
a mild allele, because
all three patients found to have this mutation are PS
and carry AF508 on their other CF chromosome.
In addition to furthering
our understanding
of the
functional properties of CFTR and the clinical consequence of the different types of mutant alleles, the
knowledge
of CF mutations
at the DNA level increases our ability to detect these mutations
in the
population. A cohort of 94 CF chromosomes
that have
been well characterized
with respect to DNA marker
haplotypes (Kerem et al., 1989b) has been used in our
primary mutation detection study. The majority (631
94) of these chromosomes
carry the AF508 mutation,
at a frequency similar to the world average (68%).
After screening of over 90% of the coding region of
CFTR, 15 additional mutations have been detected in
this cohort (Kerem et al., 1990a; this study). Together, these mutations account for over 90% (85/94)
of CF chromosomes
in this population. Knowledge of
the distribution
of these mutations
in other populations awaits further
data collection
through
the
CFTR Genetic Analysis Consortium.
It is anticipated
that there will be substantial
variation
in the frequency of each of the mutant alleles in different geographic locations.
