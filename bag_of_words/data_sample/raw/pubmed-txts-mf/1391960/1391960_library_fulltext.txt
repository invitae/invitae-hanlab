Identification and Expression of a Common Missense Mutation (L302P) in the
Acid Sphingomyelinase Gene of Ashkenazi Jewish Type A
Niemann-Pick Disease Patients
By Orna Levran, Robert J. Desnick, and Edward H.Schuchman
Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) result from the
deficient activity of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM; E.C.
3.1.4.12) and the resultant lysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin. Type A disease is a fatal, neurodegenerative
disorder of infancy, whereas type B disease has no neurologic manifestations and is characterized primarily by reticuloendothelial involvement and survival into adulthood. Both
disorders occur more frequently among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry than in the general population.
Recently, a missense mutation in the ASM gene (designated
R496L) was detected in more than 30% of the ASM alleles
from Ashkenazi Jewish type A NPD patients. We report a
second, common mutation that resulted from a T t o C
transition at nucleotide 905 and predicted a leucine t o proline
substitution at ASM codon 302 (designated L302P). Notably,
the L302P mutation occurred in 23.5% (8 of 34) of the

Ashkenazi Jewish type A NPD alleles studied. In contrast, it
was not found in any of the ASM alleles from non-Jewish
type A patients, in 36 alleles from type B patients, or in 100
ASM alleles from normal Ashkenazi Jewish individuals. To
confirm the authenticities of the L302P and R496L mutations,
each nucleotide change was separately introduced into the
full-length ASM cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis and
transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. Neither mutation expressed ASM catalytic activity, consistent with the type A
phenotype of homoallelic patients. The identification of the
L302P mutation should further facilitate molecular carrier
detection for NPD in the Ashkenazi Jewish population,
particularly because the L302P mutation can be easily detected using the restriction enzyme, AlwNI.

of 629 amino acid residues. The availability of this cDNA
permitted the localization of the ASM gene to the narrow
chromosomal region 11~15.1to 15.4 by the use of somatic
cell hybrids and in situ hybridization techniques.17 Studies
also have been initiated to determine the nature of the
genetic lesions causing types A and B NPD.1sJ9By sequencing polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified ASM
cDNAs from a type A patient of Ashkenazi Jewish descent,
a single G to T transversion was identified that predicted an
arginine to leucine substitution in residue 496 of the ASM
polypeptide (designated R496L).lS The R496L mutation
was found in about one third (ie, 32%) of the Ashkenazi
Jewish type A NPD alleles studied. In contrast, only about
5% of the alleles from non-Jewish type A patients had this
mutation. Some type A patients were homoallelic for the
R496L mutation, whereas others were heteroallelic, indicating the occurrence of other ASM mutations that caused the
type A phenotype. Interestingly, the R496L mutation also
was detected in one of the two Ashkenazi Jewish type B
patients studied. The other ASM allele in this mildly
affected patient had a 3-base deletion that resulted in the

IEMANN-PICK DISEASE (NPD) is an inborn error
of sphingomyelin catabolism that results from the
deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, acid sphingomyelinase (ASM; sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase; E.C.
3.1.4.12).1,2 Two allelic forms of this autosomal recessive
disorder have been delineated based on their distinct
phenotypes.2-6Type A NPD is a severe, neurodegenerative
disorder of infancy characterized by progressive psychomoter retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, and death by 3
years of age. In contrast, type B NPD is a nonneuronopathic disorder characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, respiratory involvement, and survival into adulthood. The
clinical course of patients with type B NPD is quite variable,
and some mildly affected patients may survive into the sixth
decade of life? Both types occur more frequently among
individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent ( 1/40,000) than
in the general p ~ p u l a t i o n However,
.~
mass screening for
carrier detection in this population has been precluded
because of the marked overlap of ASM enzymatic activities
in leukocytes and cultured cells from obligate heterozygotes
and normal individuals.
To date, biochemical investigations into the genetic
heterogeneity underlying the neuronopathic type A and
nonneuronopathic type B phenotypes have been limited. In
general, type A NPD patients tend to have slightly lower
residual activities in crude cell and tissue homogenates than
type B patients using various substrates and analogues for
assay.8-10However, the residual activities have not been well
characterized, nor have the physicokinetic properties from
type A and B patients been c ~ m p a r e d . ~ ? Limited

immunologic studies showed that patients with both subtypes have cross-reactive immunologic material in crude
cell homogenates, although the amounts of enzyme protein
have not been determined.13J4
Recently, investigations into the molecular nature of the
genetic heterogeneity in NPD have been facilitated by the
isolation and characterization of the full-length cDNA
encoding human ASM.I5J6The 2,347-bp cDNA contained

absence of an arginine residue at position 608 of the ASM
polypeptide (designated AR608).19
We report the identification of a second, common point
mutation that occurred in more than 20% of the ASM
alleles studied from Ashkenazi Jewish type A NPD patients. This T to C transition, which predicted a leucine to
proline substitution at residue 302 of the ASM polypeptide
(designated L302P), was not identified in any of the
non-Jewish type A NPD alleles studied. In addition, it was
not identified in any of the 36 alleles studied from Jewish or
non-Jewish type B patients. Transient expression studies
showed that neither the L302P nor the R496L mutation
expressed catalytically active ASM, consistent with the fact
that homoallelism for either of these mutations results in
the neuronopathic type A NPD phenotype.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell lines. Primary cultures of fibroblasts and lymphoblasts
were established from skin biopsies and peripheral blood samples
obtained with informed consent from NPD patients and family
members, and from normal individuals. NPD lines GM00165,
GM00370, GM00406, GM00559, GM02895, and GM03252 were
obtained from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). Cell lines 444X.FO1, 534R.FO3, 556X.FO1, 888V.FO1,
2789X.FO1, 4293Q.EO2, 4774Z.FO1, 5113C.LO1, 5115E.FO1, and
6791M.FO1 were obtained from the Service de Biochimie, Hospice
de Lyon (Lyon, France). Cell lines DMN 83.126, DMN 84.135,
DMN 84.87, DMN 86.49, DMN 87.71, DMN 87.99, DMN 88.12,
DMN 88.9, and RNS were provided by Dr Peter Penchev (Developmefital and Metabolic Neurology Branch, National Institute of
Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda,
MD). Cell lines AR (proband 4; GM00112A) and SL (proband 5)
were provided by Dr Elaine Zakai (Childrens’ Hospital, Philadelphia, PA) and Dr Gideon Bach (Hebrew University-Hadassah
Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel), respectively. The cells were
grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 1% penicillin, and 1 mg/mL streptomycin by standard

procedures. The diagnosis of type A or B NPD was based on
clinical criteria (eg. age at onset, presence of neurologic involvement) and by the demonstration of markedly deficient ASM
activity in cultured cells?
Identification of the L302P mutation. To identify the ASM
mutation(s) in an Ashkenazi Jewish type A NPD patient, proband
4, PCR amplification20was performed on genomic DNA isolated
from cultured skin fibroblasts.21The complete ASM coding region,
including the introdexon boundaries, was amplified in four fragments using the PCR primer pairs shown in Table 1 (primers P1 to
P8). PCR amplifications were performed for 30 cycles with Taq
polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). Each amplification cycle
consisted of denaturation for 1minute at 9 4 T , annealing for 1to 2
minutes at temperatures varying from 60°C to 72”C, and extension
for 1to 2 minutes at 72°C. For PCR product 1,which included exon
1and 632 bp of exon 2, a PCR “boost” procedure was required and
a slightly modified PCR buffer was used.17 After PCR amplification, the PCR products were precipitated by isopropanol in the
presence of ammonium acetate (final concentration, 2.5 mol/L),
and subcloned into the PCR-1000 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego,
CA). For each ligation, from four to six independant subclones
were sequenced by the dideoxy nucleotide chain termination
method.”
Confirmation of the L302P mutation by dot blot hybridization and
restriction enzyme analyses. For detection of the L302P mutation
in other NPD patients, their family members, and normal individuals, dot blot hybridization analyses2l were performed on a 570-bp
genomic fragment amplified from cell lysates using PCR primers
P3 and P4 (Table 1). PCR amplification was performed for 30
cycles, each consisting of denaturation for 1 minute at 9 4 T ,
annealing for 1.5 minutes at 62T, and extension for 1.5 minutes at
72°C. Dot blot hybridization was performed using Zetabind nylon
membranes (AMF-Cuno, Richmond, CA) and a BioRad dot-blot
apparatus (Richmond, CA). Hybridizations were performed by
standard techniques using the normal and mutant allele-specific
oligonucleotides (ASOs), (5 ’-GTCACAGCAC’ITGTGAG-3’)and
(5’-GTCACAGCACmGTGAG-3’), respectively, with the mutated nucleotide underlined. After hybridization, the blots were

0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), and then in the same solution
for 1 hour at 50°C.
The L302P mutation also could be detected by restriction
enzyme analysis because the T to C transition introduced anAZwNI
site into the ASM gene. The 570-bp ASM genomic fragment was
amplified using PCR primers P3 and P4. After amplification, the
fragment was digested with AIwNI and electrophoresed on a 1.5%
agarose gel. Only the mutant L302P allele was digested, resulting in
cleavage of the 570-bp PCR product into two fragments of 280 and
290 bp.

amplification, the fragments were purified from agarose gels and
combined for use as the template in a second PCR amplification
using sense and antisense PCR primers P9 and P12, respectively.
Note that primers P9 and PI2 overlapped unique S

sites in the pASM-3 cDNA, respectively. PCR amplifications were
performed for 20 to 25 cycles, each consisting of denaturation for 1
minute at 94T, annealing for 1 to 2 minutes at temperatures
varying from 45°C to 65T, and extension for 1 to 2 minutes at 72°C.
After amplification, the 734-bp PCR product was subcloned into
the PCR-1000 vector and sequenced to confirm the presence of the
L302P mutation and to determine that no other mutations had
been introduced into the ASM cDNA fragment. To construct the
full-length ASM cDNA containing the L302P mutation, the mutated SfiI-BcZ I fragment was isolated from the PCR-1000 subclone
and inserted into the pASM-3 cDNA by ligation exchange. The
mutated full-length cDNA was then resequenced to ensure that the
only mutation was L302P. To perform the methylation sensitive Bcl

The full-length ASM cDNA containing the R496L mutation was
constructed by essentially the same method with the following
modifications. For the first PCR amplification, primer sets P13 and
P14 and P15 and P16 (Table 1) were used to amplify 356- and
496-bp products, respectively. Primers P13 and P16, which overlapped unique Bcl I and Sph I sites, respectively,were then used for
the second PCR amplification.

RESULTS

Identijication of the L302P mutation in proband 4. Because previous dot blot hybridization studies had shown
that proband 4 did not have an R496L allele,IR this
Ashkenazi Jewish type A patient was selected as a candidate for identifying new type A NPD mutations. The ASM
coding sequence was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA
obtained from proband 4, and the four fragments containing the entire ASM coding region, including the intron/
exon boundaries, were subcloned and sequenced. Figure
2A shows the DNA sequence obtained from a region of
exon 2; note that proband 4 had a T to C transition at
nucleotide 905 in each of the six sequenced subclones. This
single-base change predicted a leucine to proline substitution in codon 302 of the ASM polypeptide (designated
U20P).
To confirm the authenticity of the W02P missense
mutation, dot blot hybridization analysis was performed on
genomic DNA obtained from proband 4 and his family
members (Fig 2B). These studies showed that proband 4
was homoallelic for the W02P mutation and that both of his
parents, a phenotypically normal sister and brother, as well
as the maternal grandfather were heterozygous. The W02P
mutation, which introduced a unique AfwNI restriction site
into the ASM gene, was not identified in more than 100
ASM alleles from normal Ashkenazi Jewish individuals,
indicating that this nucleotide change was not a polymorphism in this population. Further confirmation of the
authenticityof the W02P mutation was obtained by sequencing the PCR-amplified ASM coding region from an unrelated, Ashkenazi Jewish type A NPD patient, proband 5
(not shown). This patient also was homoallelic for the
W02P mutation.

major mutation or a series of less frequent mutations will
account for the remainder of the lesions causing this
disorder must await further analyses. However, evidence
from three other disorders that occur in the Ashkenazi
Jewish population with a frequency of 1 in 2,500 or greater
suggest that one or more common (15% to 50%) alleles is
likely. For example, two common mutations, a 4-bp insertion30 and a splice-site mutation?l account for more than
95% of the mutant p-hexosaminidase a-chain alleles in
