We present an update on mutations and polymorphisms in the human X chromosome located pyruvate
dehydrogenase Ela gene. A total of 20 different mutations are tabulated. The mutations include
deletions, insertions, and point mutations. Certain sequences seem particularly prone to mutation.
Most of the mutations are found in exons 10 and 11. Furthermore, four of the mutations are seen in
unrelated patients. Little is known about how the mutations affect the structure or function of the
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. o 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Pyruvate Dehydrogenase

PDH E l a Genes

The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex
catalyses the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetylCoA, an essential, irreversible and
rate-limiting step that connects glycolysis with the
TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (Reed,
1974). The PDH complex is located within the
mitochondrion and has a molecular weight of
approximately 7 x lo6. It is composed of multiple
copies of three enzyme components, pyruvate
dehydrogenase (El, which is a heterotetramer of
two a and two p subunits), dihydrolipoamide
acetyltransferase (E2), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3). An El kinase, a phospho-El
phosphatase, and protein X are associated with
the PDH complex. Phosphorylation of serine
residues in the E l a subunit by the kinase
inactivates the complex (Yeaman et al., 1978).
Removal of these phosphates by the phosphatase
restores activity (Linn et al., 1969). The activity
of the PDH complex is regulated via the PDH E l a
subunit and determined by the metabolic environment of the mitochondrion. All PDH complex
subunits are nuclear encoded and after translation
in the cytoplasm transported into the mitochondrion.

The PDH E l a gene expressed in somatic cells is
coded for on the X chromosome, band Xp22.1
(Brown et al., 1989b). This gene is approximately
17 kb long and contains 11 exons (Maragos et al.,
1989). The mRNA is approximately 1.5 kb and
codes for a protein of 390 amino acids, including a
29 amino acid mitochondria1 import sequence
(Dahl et al., 1987; De Meirleir et al., 1988; Koike
et al., 1988; Ho et al., 1989b). PDH E l a deficiency is caused by mutations in this gene. In addition, a tatis-specific form of PDH E l a exists. It
is coded for by an intronless gene on chromosome
4, band 4q22 (Dahl et al., 1990a).

Clinical Presentation
PDH deficiency is the major cause of lactic acidosis in children (Robinson et al., 1980; Robinson, 1989). In most cases the mutation is located

in the E l a subunit (Brown et al., 1987; Robinson
et al., 1987; Wexler et al., 1988; Robinson, 1989).
Characteristic features of PDH E l a deficiency are

metabolic acidosis and neurological dysfunction.
However, there is a wide range in the severity of
symptoms and the clinical course of the condition
(Brown et al., 1988, 1989a; H o et al., 1989a; Robinson et al., 1989). Structural neurological defects
appear to involve degeneration of apparently normally formed cerebral tissue and abnormal development of particular regions of the brain (Brown et
al., 1989a).
Despite being an X chromosome-linked disorder, the numbers of affected males and females are
approximately equal. It has been suggested that the
reason for this is that severely affected males die in
utero and that females with a severe mutation often are manifesting heterozygotes (Brown e t al.,
1989a).
Diagnosis of PDH E l a deficiency is complicated
by variability of assay results in cultured fibroblasts
and tissues. Even with reliable assay methods,
there is a poor correlation between the amount of
residual enzyme activity and the clinical severity of
the condition.
The variation in clinical presentation is due to
several factors. These include the X chromosome
inactivation pattern in females, the proportion of
cells expressing the normal gene in females, the
severity of the mutation, tissue variation in the
expression pattern of the mutant PDH E l a protein, the brain’s dependency o n PDH Ela activity,
and the energy requirement of neurological structures during fetal development.
Mutations Defined

PDH Elol deficiency is caused by a number of
different mutations (Ho et al., 1986; McKay et al.,
1986; Endo e t al., 1989; Ho e t al., 1989a; Kitano
et al., 1989; Robinson et al., 1989; Dahl et al.,
1990b; Chun et al., 1991; De Meirleir et al., 1991;
Endo et al., 1991; Hansen e t al., 1991; unpublished results in Fig. 1 and Table 1). Some affect
mRNA production or stability as seen by RNA
blot analysis. Other mutations affect protein structure or protein stability to such an extent that the
subunit can not be detected by immunological
techniques. Mutations that are not detectable by
immunological analysis can only be confirmed by
DNA sequence analysis. The known mutations are
presented in Table 1. The numbering follows Figure 1. It is of interest that the majority of mutations are located in exons 10 and 11 (Fig. 2). Despite the relatively low number of characterised
mutations, certain sequences within these regions
seem particularly prone to deletion, insertion, or
point mutation. This is also reflected in the obser-

vation that identical mutations (R263G, R302C,
S312fs, Q382fs) have been found in unrelated individuals. Six of the nine point mutations occur in
CpG dinucleotides. These are R72C, V167M,
F205L, R263G, R302C, and R378H. The frameshift mutations include both deletions and insertions. Some of the deletions are caused by deletion
of tandem repeats (S312fs and V389fs). Insertions
often include duplications (R302fs, E306ins, and
Q382fs).
Little is known about how the mutations affect
function or structure of the PDH complex. The
K3 13del prevents dephosphorylation and thereby
activation the PDH complex. In some cases the
mutant PDH Ela subunit is rapidly degraded. Presumably this is a consequence of improper complex
assembly. There appears to be tissue variation in
the degradation process (Wexler et al., 1992).
Polymorphisms

No RFLPs have been detected using 36 different
restriction enzymes (Dahl et al., 1991). The chemical cleavage method was applied to detection of
base changes in the gene. O n e polymorphism was
found in exon 8 of the coding region. Three blocks
of microsatellite DNA containing variable numbers of CA repeats were isolated from the 5’ region
of the gene (Dahl et al., 1991). Length polymorphisms in these mcrosatellite DNAs were analysed
using the polymerase chain reaction. Although the
three loci are tightly linked, the polymorphisms
appear not to be in disequilibrium, making them
the most useful markers in linkage studies. Of 31
females analysed, 12 were heterozygous for at least
one length polymorphism in one of the three
(CA), alleles.
Prenatal Diagnosis
Due to the nature of the disorder, most cases of

PDH E l a deficiency are caused by new mutations
(Brown e t al., 1989a). The need for prenatal diagnosis is therefore limited to those few families
where gonadal mosaicism is suspected or the
mother is a carrier. This is the case in at least three
of the families mentioned in Table 1. In one family
two sisters have the same V167M mutation (Chun
et al., 1992), in another family two brothers have
the R263G mutation (Wexler e t al., 1992), and in
the last family, a mildly affected mother has the
same R302C mutation as her severely affected
daughter (Dahl e t al., 1992). O n e would also expect that less severe mutations in females result in
asymptomatic carriers, but that these females can
have affected sons. Reliable prenatal diagnosis of

female fetuses can be achieved only by direct analysis of the mutation (Brown et al., 1989a). If normal results are obtained in biochemical studies, a
diagnosis of PDH E l a deficiency in females can
only be excluded if a direct analysis of the pattern
of X-inactivation demonstrates that both X chromosomes are active in a significant proportion of
the cells in the sample. Diagnosis based on gene
expression will miss the diagnosis in samples in
which most cells are expressing the “normal” X
chromosome. Furthermore, it has been reported
that a mutation in a male (R263G) results in variable tissue expression (Kerr et al., 1988).
