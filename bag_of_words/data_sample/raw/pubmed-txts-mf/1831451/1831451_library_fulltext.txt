Active Arg Residues in 0-Hexosaminidase

variant patients express both hexosaminidases A and B activities when assayed with neutral artificial substrates, e.g. 4MUG. However,their hexosaminidase A lacks activity toward
GlcNAc 6-sulfate-containing substrates, indicating the presence of a mutation at or near the active site of the a-subunit
(5). A mutation linked to themajority of B1 variant patients,
a G to A nucleotide substitution in exon 5 resulting in an
Arg17' to His substitution, has been identified (13). However,
due to the presence of a normal, active @-subunit in the
affected hexosaminidase A, it was not possible to determine
whether the affected a-subunit hadlost its catalytic ability or
undergone an alteration in substrate specificity.
In order to characterize the effect of this mutation, we took
advantage of the common evolutionary origin of the a- and
@-subunits and introduced the Arg to His substitution into
the homologous position in the @-subunit (Arg211--$ His).
Expression and lysosomal localization of homodimeric hexosaminidase B containing the Ar$ll + His substitution was
confirmed. The most striking feature of this mutant dimer
was its lack of normal hexosaminidase B activity (14). Thus,
we proposed that the severe infantile B1 phenotype results
from an inactive a-subunit in the affected hexosaminidase A.
In addition to its lack of enzymatic activity we also found
that the hexosaminidase B protein containing the Arg211-+
His substitutionhas decreased lysosomal stabilityand is
slower to mature than the wild type enzyme i n uiuo. These
data indicated that,as originally predicted by Ohno and
Suzuki (13), a more general change in protein structure had
occurred through this substitution. Therefore, it remained to
be determined whether the B1 phenotype resulted ( a ) from
the loss of an "active" Arg residue, i.e. Arg'" in the @ and the
homologous Arg17' in the a-subunit are part of the catalytic/
substrate binding site of @-hexosaminidaseor ( b )from a small
perturbation in the secondary structure in close proximity to
such a region.
In order to differentiate between the above twopossibilities,
we first studied the effect and selectivity of arginine-specific
chemical-modifying reagents, i.e. 2,3-butanedione and phenylglyoxal, on purified hexosaminidases A and B from human
placenta. We then made more and less conservative substitutions at the @-ArgZ1'site through in. vitro mutagenesis of
the cDNA encoding the @-subunit.We determined the effects
of these substitutions on ( a ) the residual enzymatic activity,
as well as the susceptibility of this activity to the above
arginine-specific chemical modifying reagents, ( b )the i n uiuo
stability of the protein in the lysosome, and ( c ) the steady
state ratio of precursor to mature forms of the human hexosaminidase B produced in transfected monkey COS-1 cells.
We conclude that /3-Ar$11 and ~ u - A r g 'are
~ ~ active residues
and that the presence of the unique Arg side chain at these
specific positions in theappropriate subunit arenecessary for
the dimeric proteins to obtain a significant level of enzymatic
activity. Kinetic analysis of the small amount of residual
activity expressed by hexosaminidase B lacking the active
A r e ' indicates that AT$" is not involved in substrate binding. However, a small shift in pH optimum of the Arg2I1+
Lys mutant enzyme compared with the wild type suggests a
role for Ar$ll in catalysis. Thus, the B1 mutation represents
arare example of anaturally occurring humanmutation
whose characterization has resulted in the identification of
an active residue in the catalytic site of an enzyme.
MATERIALS ANDMETHODS

Inactivation of 0-Hexosaminidase A by 2,3-Butanedwne-@-Hexosaminidases A and B were purified from human placenta by the
method of Mahuran and Lowden (6). 40 pl of @-hexosaminidaseA
(100 ng) was incubated with 25 mM 2,3-butanedione in 60 pl of 50

mM sodium borate buffer, pH 8.3, at 25 "C. 10-pl samples were
removed at time intervals (0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min) and
diluted into 90 gl of cold McIlvaine buffer (X), pH 4.1, containing
0.3% human serum albumin for assay. The residual enzyme activity
of both the a- and (Y @-subunitsof the modified hexosaminidase A
dimer was determined using the artificial substrates 4-MUGS and 4MUG, respectively, as previously reported (16), with incubation times
of 60 and 15 min, respectively, at 37 "C.
Inactivation of @-HexosaminidaseB by Phenylglyoxal-20 p1 of
purified human placental @-hexosaminidaseB (180 ng) was incubated
with 80 p1 of 20 mM phenylglyoxal in 50 mM bicine, 100 mM sodium
bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.3, at 25 "C. 10-pl aliquots were removed at
30-min time intervals and diluted into 90 p1 of McIlvaine buffer, pH
4.1, containing 0.3% human serum albumin for assay with 4-MUG.
In order to determine the number of arginine residues modified by
the phenylglyoxal, a large scale modification of hexosaminidase B
was done by incubating 5 pg of the enzyme with 50 mM phenylglyoxal
at the above conditions for 6 h (resulting in the loss of 93% of its
catalytic activity). The modified protein was acetone-precipitated a t
-20 "C overnight and washed with 70% acetone/water prior to amino
acid analysis by the PIC0 Tag method (17).
Site-directed Mutagenesis and Vector Constructions-Genera1 cloning procedures were as described by Maniatis (38). A 500-base pair
EcoRI fragment from pHexB43, a pcD cloning and mammalian
expression vector containing afull length cDNA encoding the prepro@-polypeptidechain of 0-hexosaminidase (3, 18), was subcloned into
pBS(+) (Stratagene). The two oligonucleotides synthesized to mutate
Arg2I1to Lys or Thr, respectively, are as follows (base changes are
underlined):
5'-TGATACATCCA_AACATTATCTGCCAGTT-3',
A
and 5'-GGAATTTTGATTGATACATCCAcACATTATCTG-3'.
500-base pair fragment from pHexB43 containing the B1-like mutation (Arg2" + His) (14) was also subcloned into pBS(+) and 5'TGATACATCCCACCGTTATCTGCCAGTTAA-3' synthesized to
mutate the adjacent H 2 l 2 t oArg. This resulted in a mutant protein
with the Ar$"-HisZ1' reversed to yield His 211-Ar$'2, the "reversal
mutation." Mutagenesis was performed according to published procedures (Amersham Corp.), based on the original method described
by Taylor et. al. (19). The mutations were verified by sequencing the
entire 500-base pair fragment using the dideoxy chain termination
method. The mutant inserts were subcloned back into pHexB43 for
expression studies.
Cell Culture-COS-1 monkey kidney cells (American Type Tissue
Collection) were maintained at 37 "C and 5% CO, ina-minimal
essential media (Flow Laboratories, Inc.) containing streptomycin
and penicillin (100 mg/liter) and 10% fetal bovine serum. To determine if the in uiuo stability of the expressed protein in the cell's
lysosome wasadversely affected by a given mutation, 20 p M leupeptin
was included in the media (14, 20, 21). In our previous report, we
demonstrated an =&fold increase in the amount ofArgZ1' + His 0protein cross-reacting material present intracellularly when cells were
grown in leupeptin (14).
DNA Transfection-Transfections were done according tothe
method of Chen and Okayama (22). 10 pg of plasmid DNA was cotransfected with 10 pg of pBLCAT2, a plasmid containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, to normalize for transfection efficiency between culture dishes. CAT assays were performed according to the method of Neumann et al. (23).
Assay for 0-Hexosaminidase B Actiuity-The levels of human 0hexosaminidase activity in transfectedcell lysates was determined by
a solid state immunoprecipitation assay, utilizing a polyclonal rabbit
anti-human @-IgGprepared in our laboratory, as previously described
(14). Alternatively, substrate concentrations were increased from 1.5
to 3 mM and incubation times increased from 15 to 60 min in order
to maximize residual activities in cells transfected with mutant constructs.
Western Blot-In order to determine the approximate amount of
steady state protein produced by COS cells transfected with the
normal and mutant constructs, samples of COS lysates (100-150 rg
of protein) containing equal amounts of CAT activity (normalizing
for intraexperimental variations in transfection efficiency) were examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamidegel electrophoresis/
Western Blot analysis, as previously described (14).

for determining

substrate ranging in final concentration from 0.4 to 4 mM. Initial
velocities were utilized to accurately determine the catalytic velocity

obtained were reduced by the units of activity found in an identical
immunoprecipitated sample of mock-transfected cell lysate incubated
under identical conditions. The data was analyzed using a computerized nonlinear least squares curve fitting program for the Macintosh, Kaleidagraph, based on the Michaelis-Menten equation, V, =

Hexosaminidase B-COS cell lysates transfected with 10 pg of either

hexosaminidase B activity using the solid state immunoprecipitation
assay. Lysates were analyzed with 4 mM 4-MUG artificial substrate
in McIlvaine's buffer adjusted to the the following pH levels: 2.0, 3.0,
3.6, 4.0, 4.6, 5.0, 6.0,
and 7.0. The values obtained were reduced by
the number of units of activity produced by an identical immunoprecipitated sample of mock-transfected cell lysate incubated under
identical conditions. Standard deviations were calculated from three
sets of independent transfection experiments.
RESULTS

Znuctioation Studies with DicarbonylReagents-We
first
tested the possibility that Arg211 in the @-subunit and the
homologous Arg17s in thea-subunitare
active residues
through treatment of the purified placental isozymes with
dicarbonyl reagents. These reagents have been shown to specifically interact with active Arg residues (24). One such
compound, 2,3-butanedione, acts as a strong competitive inhibitor (25, 26). As shown in Fig. 1, incubation of purified
placental @-hexosaminidaseA with this compound results in
a rapid, time-dependent loss of enzymatic activity associated
with both the a- (as assessed by 4-MUGS) and @- (as assessed
by 4-MUG) subunits of the heterodimer. These rates were
linear (on a semilogarithmic plot) up to approximately 8590% inactivation,and the kinetics are pseudo-first order.
Another Arg-specific reagent, phenylglyoxal, acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor by forming a covalent bond with the
active Arg residue (26). Treatment of @-hexosaminidaseB
with 20 mM phenylglyoxal also resulted in progressive, although somewhat slower, inactivation of the enzyme, the
kinetics of which was complex (Fig. 2). After 6 h, there was a
92% loss of catalytic activity.
Since reactions with the phenylglyoxal reagent produce
covalent bonds, it was possible to determine the approximate
number of Arg residues in hexosaminidase B that react with
this compound to produce the 92% loss of activity. This was
accomplished by comparing the amino acid composition of
the protein before and after treatment. Amino acid analysis
of unmodified, active enzyme produced an Arg content of 24
f 3 residues/@-subunit, whereas analysis of the modified,
inactive protein revealed 19 f 3 arginine residues/@-subunit.
Since the error limitsof these determinations areoverlapping,
we conclude that the observed loss of catalytic activity upon
phenlyglyoxal modification was due to a selective modification
of a small number of or a single Arg residue(s).
Analysis of Additional Substitution Mutations at the Arg211

subunit of hexosaminidase B, three additional mutant constructs were prepared (a) anArg211 + Thr mutation that is

of any secondary structure changes to a small area in the
protein, since it produces no overall change in amino acid
composition in this functional domain.
Leuek of Human Hexosaminidase B Actiuity-COS cells
were transfected with pHexB43 (positive control) (14), or a
derivative of pHexB43 containing mutationsthat produce one
of the three above substitutions in the resulting protein. The
transfected cells were incubated for 48 h to allow expression
and lysosomal accumulation of the enzyme. The resultant
specific activities of the translation products from the three
mutant constructs were very low when assayed with 1.5 mM
4-MUG artificial substrate, which is approximately 50-100fold less than the human hexosaminidase activity produced
by the positive control. This was less than double the negative
control, a change that we consider to be insignificant (Table
I). However, the growth of cells in 20 PM leupeptin (to decrease
proteolysis in uiuo, thereby increasing the stability of the
proteins in the lysosome (14), see below), followed
by assaying
the lysates using double the substrate concentration (3 mM
4-MUG), revealed a significant increase in human hexosaminidase activity levels. Both the wild type and mutant activities were increased 3-4-fold, whereas negative control
levels remained unchanged (Table I). Thus, residual activity
produced by the mutant proteins were up to 6-fold greater
than that of background. Although residual activity of the
mutant enzyme remained 50-100-fold less than wild type
hexosaminidase activity, it was now high enough above the
negative control to be considered significant and to allow us
to analyze it biochemically.
Western Blot Analysis-Because only low levels of residual
hexosaminidase B activity were detected in the COS cell
lysates transfected with any of the three mutant cDNAs, it
was necessary to assess whether the mutant proteins translated from these cDNAs were successfully transported to the
lysosome, as was the protein containing the original B1-like
mutation (Arg211+ His) (14). The levels of immunoreactive
protein from COS cell lysates transfected with the mutant
cDNAs were compared with that obtained from cell lysates
transfected with the wild type construct (Fig. 3). Western blot
analysis of reduced COS cell lysates transfected with the wild
type pHexB43 revealed major immunoreactive protein bands

the pro-@precursor polypeptide (residues 43-556 of the prepro-(3chain) can be observed with increased protein loading.
Because of its lower antigenicity (ll), the smaller (3b chain
(residues 122-311 of the prepro-P chain) is visualized only
with an increased protein load, as previously reported (14).
The constructs coding for the Arg2” + Thr and Arg211-His212
+ His-Arg substitutions were visually estimated to produce
about 10-20% of wild type protein levels, whereas the construct containing the Arg211+ Lys mutation produced mature
protein in nearly equivalent amounts. Thus, the hexosaminidase B containing the conservative Arg211 + Lys substitution does not demonstrate the lack of lysosomal stability
previously observed with the B1-like Arg211+ His substitution (14), yet it is still only marginally active.
To determine if the decreased steady state protein levels
+ His-Arg
produced by the Arg211 + Thr and Arg211-His212
substitutions were due to the instability of the mutant proteins in the lysosome (in uiuo), as was the case with the
original Arg211 + His mutation (14), transfected COS cells
were grown in media containing 20 PM leupeptin, a tripeptide
serine and thiol protease inhibitor known to increase the
stability of proteins in the lysosome (20, 21). The human (3polypeptides were again examined by Western blot analysis.

(14), the inhibition of proteolysis resulted in adramatic

the decreased stability.
Growth of the cells in leupeptin also resulted in the detection of an additional band at -38 kDa in both wild type and

substrate concentrations. Using cell lysates treated in this
way, we were able to assess the susceptibility of this activity
to dicarbonyl reagents. If the specific dicarbonyl modification
of Arg2I1in thepurified placental isozyme was responsible for
the decrease in 4-MUG activity, mutant proteins synthesized
with a different amino acid residue a t position 211 should no
longer be as susceptible to these reagents. Aswe observed
with the normal placental
enzyme, incubation of the cell lysate
transfected with thewild type cDNA (COS(+)) with phenylglyoxal decreased human hexosaminidase B activity by approximately 70% compared with the activity produced by an
equivalent amountof lysate incubated in buffer only (Fig. 4).
Whereas no change in activitywas detected after phenylglyoxal treatment of the lysate containing hexosaminidase B
with the Arg2" + Lys mutation, a very slight decrease was
observed with the Arg2I1+ Thr substitution. However, incubation with phenylglyoxal of the lysates containing hexosaminidase B substituted with Arg2" + His or Arg211-His212
His-Arg produced a slight increase in human hexosaminidase
activity, as comparedwitheachlysate
incubated in buffer
alone (Fig. 4). A similar increase in enzymatic activity after
phenylglyoxal treatment has been found with other enzymes
that do not contain an active Arg residue (31). Thus, Arg2I1
is the active, dicarbonyl reagent-sensitiveArg in the @-subunit
of hexosaminidase.

possible
theinvolvement of this residue in catalysis was further investigated by
the comparisonof the pHprofile of the Arg211-+ Lys mutant
protein to that produced by the wild type enzyme (Fig. 6).
The wild type enzyme had a wide p H optimum with a peak
between pH 4.0 and 4.6, in agreement with previously published values (33). The pH optimum of the mutant enzyme,

however, was significantly narrowed and slightly displaced,
with the enzyme showing maximal activity between pH 4.6
and 5.0. The mutant enzymepossessedonly 55 k 15% of
maximal activityat pH 4.0 as compared with 97 k 5% for the
wild type (Fig. 6). The shift in pH optimum may reflect an
alteration ina charge-transfer relay system due to replacethe
ment of anarginine residue with a lysine in the mutant
enzyme.
DISCUSSION

We previously examined the biochemical consequences of
the Arg17' substitution by His in the a-subunit
of hexosaminidase A (the B1 variant of Tay-Sachs disease) by analyzing
the effects of the homologous Arg211 + His substitution in
the /?-subunit of hexosaminidase B. We found that the substitution causesa near total loss of normal hexosaminidase B
activity. However, we also observed that the Arg211 + His
substitution decreased the in vivo stability of the protein in
the lysosome, as well as slowing its rate of processing from
the pro to mature forms
of hexosaminidase B (14). These data
suggested that a more general change in protein structure had
been caused by this substitution, as previously predicted by
computer modeling (13). Therefore, it remained to be determined whether ArgZ" in the @-subunit and the homologous
Arg17' in the a-subunit are active
residues (i.e. are partof the
A
catalytic/substrate binding site of @-hexosaminidase), or if
they are simply in close proximity to such residues. In the
present study,we first tested theformer possibility using the
