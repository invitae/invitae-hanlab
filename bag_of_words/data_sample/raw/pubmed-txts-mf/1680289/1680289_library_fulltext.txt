Summary
We have identified a previously unrecognized missense mutation in a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID). The mutation is a G61-to-A transition at a
CG dinucleotide and predicts a glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 216. Computer analysis of secondary
structure predicts a major alteration with loss of a beta-pleated sheet in a highly conserved region of the
protein. The basepair substitution also generates a new site for the restriction enzyme BstXI in exon 7 of the
genomic DNA. Digestion of genomic DNA from the patient and from his parents revealed that he was
homozygous for the mutation and that his mother and father were carriers. This mutation in homozygous
form appears to be associated with very severe disease, since the patient had perinatal onset of clinical
manifestations of SCID, the highest concentration of the toxic metabolite deoxyATP in nine patients studied,
and a relatively poor immunologic response during the initial 2 years of therapy with polyethylene glycoladenosine deaminase. Analysis of DNA from 21 additional patients with ADA-SCID and from 19 unrelated
normals revealed that, while none of the normal individuals showed the abnormal restriction fragment, two
of the 21 patients studied were heterozygous for the G646-to-A mutation.

Introduction
Mutations at the adenosine deaminase (ADA) locus in
man result in a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from
an early onset, rapidly fatal immunodeficiency (severe
combined immunodeficiency [SCID]), to grossly normal immune function. In general, patients with ADAdeficient SCID (ADA-SCID) carry mutations causing
complete absence of enzyme activity in all cell types.
A late-onset, milder, and slowly progressive immunodeficiency appears to be associated with mutations resulting in absence of enzyme activity in erythrocytes
and in extremely low but detectable residual enzyme
activity in other cell types. Mutations causing absence

of enzyme activity in erythrocytes but with retention
of greater than 5% of normal enzyme activity in other
cell types ("partial" ADA deficiency) are usually associated with grossly normal immune function. Although the clinical presentation of classical ADASCID is relatively uniform, there is some variability
with respect to several features, including age at onset,
extralymphoid manifestations, and initial residual immune function (Giblett et al. 1972; reviewed in
Hirschhorn 1986; Kredich and Hershfield 1989).
ADA is a monomeric protein of 40,762 daltons that
is expressed in all cell types. Deficiency of the enzyme
results in accumulation and/or excretion of abnormally high amounts of substrates, including adenosine
and 2' deoxyadenosine, and of the metabolite deoxyATP and also results in secondary inhibition of the
enzyme SAH hydrolase. The relatively lymphospecific
consequences of the genetic deficiency of ADA are believed to reflect the predominance in lymphoid cells
of pathways leading to accumulation of metabolites
(most notably deoxyATP) and/or greater sensitivity

Severe Combined Immunodeficiency in ADA Deficiency

of lymphoid cells to abnormal concentrations of substrates. In general, the degree of accumulation and/or
excretion of metabolites and substrates, as well as the
severity of disease, correlate with the degree of enzyme
deficiency (reviewed in Kredich and Hershfield 1989;
Hirschhorn 1990).
The gene coding for ADA has been isolated, and
the nucleotide sequences of both the mRNA and the
structural gene have been determined. The cDNA contains 1,089 bp of coding sequence and is distributed
in 12 exons contained in approximately 32 kb of DNA
(Orkin et al. 1983; Valerio et al. 1983, 1984, 1985;
Wiginton et al. 1983, 1984, 1986; Daddona et al.
1984). This information has enabled the molecular
definition of mutations in several patients with ADA
deficiency. The majority of patients reported thus far
have grossly normal mRNA, most consistent with
single-basepair missense mutations. Six different point
mutations resulting in single-amino-acid substitutions
have been reported in patients with ADA-SCID (table
1; Bonthron et al. 1985; Valerio et al. 1986; Akeson
et al. 1987, 1988; Markert et al. 1989; Hirschhorn et
al. 1990). An additional single-base-pair substitution
at a splice site, resulting in an abnormally spliced,
in-frame mRNA has also been reported (Akeson et
al. 1988). In addition, six different point mutations
resulting in partial ADA deficiency have also been defined (Hirschhorn et al. 1989, 1990). A conservative
Lys80-to-Arg mutation that appears to be a previously
undetected normal polymorphism not grossly affecting ADA activity has also been reported (Valerio et al.
1986). Gross deletions of all or part of the ADA gene
are rare, with only two such patients having been reported, both of whom appear to carry the identical
deletion involving recombination at an Alu repeat (Berk-

879

al. 1987, 1990; Markert et al. 1987, 1988)
(table 1).
We now report a newly identified missense mutation
that in homozygous form was associated with both
perinatal onset of clinical manifestations of ADASCID and the highest concentration of toxic metabolites we have seen in an ADA-SCID patient. The mutation alters a restriction site, and we could therefore
determine both that the patient was homozygous for
the mutation and that two of 21 additional patients
were genetic compounds for this mutation in conjunction with other mutations.

Subjects and Methods
Brief Case Report

The patient is the second male child of a mating
between parents from two different extended Amish
families from eastern Pennsylvania. Although no consanguinity could be determined from three-generation
pedigrees, the two families are known to have intermarried in the past. At 3d of age the child developed
respiratory distress and was hospitalized for pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotics. He was then transferred to Geisinger Hospital where the finding of severe lymphopenia and continued non-responsiveness
to multiple antibiotics led to his transfer, at 4 wk of
age, to Childrens Hospital of Pennsylvania, for possible bone marrow transplantation. However, no suitable bone marrow donor was found. He remained
profoundly lymphopenic during the first 6 wk of life
(absolute lymphocyte count 144-574), with few mature T or B cells (4%-10% CD4, 5%-13% CD8, and
6%-15% CD11; 3% B1 /B4) and with 23% mononu-

clear cells bearing NK markers. Both humoral and
cellular immunity were defective, with nondetectable
IgA and IgM at 1 mo of age and with absence (<1%
of control) of proliferative response of lymphocytes to
the mitogens (phytohemagglutinin) PHA, Con A, or
PWM (pokeweed mitogen). Chest X-ray revealed
changes consistent with the chondro-osseous dysplasia seen in approximately 50O of ADA-SCID patients
(Cederbaum et al. 1976). He was treated with IV pentamidine and erythromycin, for the pulmonary infection, and with ketoconazole and nystatin, for urinary
candidiasis, as well as with IV IgG. Open-lung biopsy
at S wk of age failed to reveal pneumocystis. At 6 wk
of age he was begun on polyethylene glycol-modified
ADA (PEG-ADA) (Hershfield et al. 1987), which he
has continued to receive until this time (he is now 2
years of age), together with IV Ig, prophylaxis with
trimethoprim/sulfamethexazole, and antibiotics as
needed.
Individuals Studied

Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphoid cell
lines from the proband (GM 11411) and his parents
(GM 11412 and GM 11413), as well as lymphoid
and/or fibroblast cell lines from 21 additional ADAdeficient SCIDs, were studied. From the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Mutant Repository (Camden, NJ)
were cell lines GM 0469, GM 1390, GM 1715, GM
2436, GM 2471, GM 2578, GM 2606, GM 2756,
GM 2825A, GM 3136, GM 3137, and GM 4258A;
from the Repository for Mutant Human Cell strains
(Quebec) were WG 548 and WG 290. CR, DM, TM,
CJ, Ro, Te, Fx, and Fa were patients of Drs. W. Borkowsky and R. Hirschhorn (CR), Dr. D. Kirkpatrick
(DM), Dr. F. S. Rosen (TM), Dr. M. Ballow (CJ and
R.), Dr. A. Heywood (Te), Drs. A. Martin and
R. Hong (Fx), and Dr. J. Jung (Fa).
General Methods
DNA was isolated, digested with restriction endonucleases, electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose gels,
transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and hybridized

with 32P randomly labeled DNA probes by standard
methods as described elsewhere (Southern 1975; Maniatis et al. 1982; Feinberg and Vogelstein 1984; Tzall
et al. 1989). The genomic DNA probe containing
exon 8 was a Ball/BglII fragment subcloned as described elsewhere (Tzall et al. 1989). Determination of
RFLPs was as described elsewhere (Tzall et al. 1989).

Hirschhorn et al.
RNA was extracted by the method of Chirgwin et al.
(1979).
Amplification of Reverse-transcribed RNA

On the basis of the method of Saiki et al. (1988), 1

gg total RNA was incubated with 0.5 mM dNTPs, 3

ig of oligo dT, 50 mM Tris pH 8.3, 50 mM KCI, 8
mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, and 1 g1 (16.5 units) AMV
reverse transcriptase (Life Sciences, Fla) in 50 pl at
41 IC for 2 h. Ten microliters reaction mixture was
diluted to 50 ,l with additions, resulting in 0.2 mM
dNTPs, 10 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, 1.6 mM MgC12,
2 mM DTT, 0.01 % gelatin, and 1 jg each of primers.
The primers used consisted of bp 19-54 with an added
5' EcoRI site and of the complementary strand of bp
1095-1124 with an added 5' HindIII site (bp 1 = A
of ATG). The mixture was heated to 94°C for 4 min,
0.5 jl (2.5 units) Taq polymerase (Perkin ElmerCetus) was added, and it was overlain with 50 jl mineral oil and was incubated for 30 cycles of 5 min at
72°C and of 1 min 20 s at 94°C with the last cycle
being at 72°C for 10 min. The reaction product was
electrophoresed in low-melt agarose (BRL), the major
band cut was out, and the DNA was eluted in 0.2 ml
H20 by two cycles consisting of first freezing in dry
ice/ethanol and then thawing at 370C, followed by
centrifugation in a Beckman microfuge for 10 min;
and DNA in the supernatant was precipitated with
ethanol. The resuspended pellet was digested with
EcoRI and HindIII, extracted with phenol, phenol-Sevag, and Sevag, precipitated with ethanol, resuspended, and ligated to EcoRI/HindIII-digested
pUC 18 for further analysis by restriction digestion
and DNA sequence determination. DNA sequence
analysis of double-stranded DNA used a series of
ADA-specific primers (Sanger et al. 1977; Bonthron
et al. 1985; Mierendorf and Pfeffer 1987). DNA from
12 clones containing inserts with the expected size and
restriction were pooled for analysis of sequence. One
of these clones was also sequenced separately.
Biochemical and Immunologic Studies
In vitro tests of immune function (proliferative responses to the mitogens PHA, PWM, and Con A and

enumeration of lymphocyte subsets with monoclonal
antibodies) were performed by standard methods as
described elsewhere (Garty et al. 1989). Determination of ADA activity and concentration of erythrocyte
deoxyATP were by methods described elsewhere
(Hirschhorn et al. 1979).

Biochemical studies

Determination of ADA activity in erythrocytes revealed 0.0625 nmol/mg Hb/h, or less than 0.2% of
normal (mean + SEM = 42.7 + 3. 1; n = 10). (The
true ADA activity was <0.002% of normal, since only
0.004 nmol was sensitive to the inhibitor EHNA,
which is specific for the ADA isozyme encoded by the
locus affected in ADA-SCID [Schrader et al. 1978].)
Determination of ADA activity in an EBV-immortalized lymphoid line revealed less than 0.1% of normal ADA in the child and approximately 50% of normal activity in both parents (table 2). Erythrocyte
deoxyATP was markedly elevated, to a concentration
higher than was found in eight additional previously
studied patients (table 2).

Determination of the Specific Mutation

Sequencing of cDNA amplified from reversetranscribed mRNA revealed only a G646-to-A transition at a CG dinucleotide. The basepair change predicts a glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 216.
As is to be expected from the substitution of the basic
amino acid arginine for a neutral glycine, computer
analysis of secondary structure predicted an increase
in both hydrophilicity and surface probability. The
Chou-Fasman algorithm predicts loss of a betapleated sheet between two helical domains (fig. 1).
The recent report of crystallographic analysis of the
protein is consistent with this analysis and indicates
that the adjoining codon, Glu217, is involved in the
catalytic mechanism (Wilson et al. 1991).
The basepair substitution also generates a new site
for the restriction enzyme BstXI in exon 7 of genomic
DNA. Digestion of genomic DNA from the patient
and from his parents revealed that he was homozygous
for the mutation and that his mother and father were
carriers of the mutation (fig. 2). Analysis of genomic
DNA from 21 additional patients with ADA-SCID
and from 19 unrelated normals revealed that two patients (GM 1390 and GM 2436) were heterozygous
for the mutation while none of the 19 normal individuals showed the abnormal restriction fragment (data
not shown).
Determination of Haplotypes

Since the mutation is a G-to-A transition at a CG
dinucleotide, it represents what has been termed a
"hot-spot" mutation. In order to evaluate whether

these identical mutations derived from a common ancestor or occurred independently in one or more of the
three patients, we determined RFLPs at the ADA locus
(Tzall et al. 1989). The proband carried the mutation
on haplotype I, found in 62% of normal chromosomes
(common RFLP at all sites), as defined by seven RFLPs
at the ADA locus, and he exhibited the most common
nucleotide at six silent polymophic sites (tabulated in
Akeson et al. 1987). One of the two other patients
carrying the mutation (i.e., patient GM 2436) was
also homozygous for the most common haplotype I.
The third patient (GM 1390) was heterozygous at the
PstI, MspI IVS3, MspI IVS5, and Ball RFLPs and was
homozygous for the common RFLP at the other sites.
Since DNA from the parents of GM 1390 was not
available, we could not determine phase, but, on the
basis of observed linkage disequilibrium, GM 1390
is probably heterozygous for either the I/V or II/VI
haplotypes (Tzall et al. 1989). If he is heterozygous

with genomic probe containing exon 8. The normal BstXI sites are
at bp 27696 in IVS 6 and at 31500 in IVS 11 (Wiginton et al.
1986), predicting a 3.8-kb fragment detectable by a genomic probe
containing exon 8. The mutation creates a new BstXI site in exon
7 at bp 28532, predicting a smaller-than-normal 2.968-kb fragment
extending from mid exon 7 to IVS 11 and detectable by the exon
8 probe (it also predicted an 0.836-kb fragment extending from IVS
6 to mid exon 7, but this fragment is not visualized by the exon 8
probe). The proband (PT) exhibited only a smaller-than-normal
band, while both parents (MO and FA) exhibited the smaller band
in addition to a normal band. Normals (NL) exhibited only the
larger band.

for the I and V haplotypes, the mutation could have
occurred on the same haplotype as in the other two
patients, and the findings are therefore not inconsistent with the mutation's having derived from a common ancestor.

Discussion

In a child with ADA-SCID we have determined the
mutation that, in homozygous form, is associated with
very severe disease, as manifested by extremely early
onset of disease (i.e., 3 d of age) and the highest concentration of a toxic metabolite that we have seen in
the nine patients studied. In addition, the recovery of
immune function during 2 years of PEG-ADA therapy
has been poor in comparison with that seen in other
similarly treated ADA-SCID cases (M.Hershfield, personal communication; authors' unpublished observations). Although he has been clinically well (with the
exception of two episodes of sepsis due to infection of
a central venous line) and has maintained his growth
curve slightly below the fifth percentile, his immunologic reconstitution on standard PEG-ADA therapy

883

remained limited, with lymphopenia and markedly
impaired mitogen responses. These observations suggest that homozygosity for this mutation may be particularly deleterious. However, since, in this disorder,
exposure to environmental microorganisms can play
a major role in the initial phenotype, speculation as to
genotype-phenotype correlations must be viewed with
caution until additional patients homozygous for the
codon 216 mutation have been ascertained. Nonetheless, we have also found that a mutation altering the
adjacent codon 217 (with a deletion rendering the second allele nonfunctional) occurs in a child with both
the next highest concentration of deoxy ATP (table
2, patient 1) and very early onset of florid disease
(unpublished results). These observations are consistent with recent reports that codons 212-217 are evolutionarily highly conserved and that Glu217 is in the
catalytic site (Change et al. 1991; Wilson et al. 1991).
We have also identified the codon 216 mutation in two
additional ADA-SCID cases. Both of these children
are genetic compounds for the mutation affecting codon 216 and for a second as yet unidentified allele that
could modify the phenotype.
The mutation is a G-to-A transition at a CG dinucleotide and therefore may represent a hot spot mutation,
presumably reflecting spontaneous deamination of
methylated cytosines at CG dinucleotides (reviewed in
Cooper and Krawczak 1990). Similar to our finding
of three patients with the same mutation occurring at
a CG site, two other mutations at the ADA locus that
result in SCID - i.e., the mutations Ala329-to-Val and
Arg2t1-to-His-have each been reported in more than
one unrelated patient, and both also occur at CG sites
(Akeson et al. 1987; 1988; Markert et al. 1989). The
Ala329-to-Val mutation has been shown to have occurred independently on two different chromosomal
backgrounds. Determination of haplotypes for the
Gly216-to-Arg mutation reported here was compatible
with the possibility of a common ancestor. This, however, cannot be stated with a high degree of certainty,
since the mutations were found on a haplotype accounting for 62% of normal chromosomes. It would
seem likely that both GM 2436 and the Amish index
patient derive the mutation from a common ancestor,
since GM 2436 is Swiss and since the easternPennsylvania Amish immigrated from the canton of
Bern in Switzerland (V. McKusick, personal communication). Their common background raises the possibility that the Gly216-to-Arg mutation, although not
found in 38 normal Caucasian chromosomes, could be

884
a normal polymorphism unique to the inbred Swiss/
Amish population. Such an interpretation is unlikely,
since the third patient who bears the mutation derived
from west Texas, was not Amish, and had no known
Swiss ancestry. More to the point, the site of the mutation, in the region of the highly conserved sequence
within the catalytic site (Chang et al. 1991; Wilson et
al. 1991), would further argue that the Gly216-to-Arg
mutation is responsible for the disease.
