Benzoxazinorifamycin reacted with various secondary amines to yield various 5'-substituted aminobenzoxazinorifamycin derivatives. The derivatives exhibited potent activities against gram-positive bacteria and mycobacteria. The antimicrobial activities of these compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium intracellulare were superior to those of rifampicin. Some of these compounds showed good plasma levels after oral administration in rats.
