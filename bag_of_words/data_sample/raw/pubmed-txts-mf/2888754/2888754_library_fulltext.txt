Surface hydrophobicity, stability, solubility, and kinetics of polymerization were studied using hemoglobins with four different
amino acids at theB6 position:
Hb A (GluB'), Hb C ( L y p ) , Hb Machida (GlnB'), and Hb
S (Val*'). The surfacehydrophobicity increased in the
order of Hb C, Hb A, Hb Machida, and Hb S, coinciding
with the hydrophobicity of the amino acid at the 06
position. Solubility of the oxy-form of these hemoglobins decreased in relation to increases intheir surface
hydrophobicity, suggesting that the solubility is controlled by the strengthof hydrophobicity of the amino
acid at the 86 position. The solubility of the oxy-form
of these hemoglobins is always higher thanthat of the
deoxy-form. There isa similar linear relationshipbetween the solubility and surfacehydrophobicity among
deoxyhemoglobins A, C, and Machida. However, the
solubility of deoxy-Hb S deviated significantly from
the expected value, indicating that the extremely low
solubility of deoxy-Hb S is not directly related to the
hydrophobicity of the 86 valine.
Kinetic studies on the polymerization of deoxy-Hb
Machida revealed a distinct delay time prior topolymerization. This confirms our previous hypothesis that
86 valine isnot responsible for the delay time prior to
gelation. The kinetics of the polymerization of 1:l
mixtures of sickle and non-sickle hemoglobins were
similar tothose of pure Hb S, suggesting that only one
of the two 86 valines is involved in an intermolecular
contact. In mixtures of equal amounts of Hb S and Hb
A, Hb C, or Hb Machida, half of the asymmetricalAS,
SC, and S-Machida hybrid hemoglobins behaved like
Hb S during nucleation, while the other half behaved
like thenon-sickle hemoglobin.

kinetics of gelation and crystallization as well as thesolubility
of hemoglobin after these reactions (3, 4). More recently, we
established a method to measure the surface hydrophobicity
of proteins using the elution pattern of hemoglobins from a
TSK-GEL-SW type column in high phosphate buffer (5).
Using these methods, we studied the effect of the amino acid
at the j36 position on the solubility, stability, surface hydrophobicity, and the polymerization of Hb A (Glue6), Hb C
(Lyss'), Hb Machida (Gin@), and Hb S (Val&).
EXPERIMENTALPROCEDURES

Hemoglobins A, C, and S were purified from hemolysates containing hemoglobins AS, SC, and S by chromatography on CM-Sephadex
as described elsewhere (6). Hb Machida was discovered in Japan and
purified by the isoelectrofocusing method (7). The concentration of
hemoglobinwas determined spectrophotometrically by the use of
millimolar extinction coefficient of d m= 50 for deoxyhemoglobin
and mEw = 53.6 for carbonmonoxyhemoglobin (8).
Surface hydrophobicity was determined by the elution volume of a
hemoglobin from a TSK-G-2000 SW column a t 25 "C (4). A Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography system composed of a P500 pump, an LCC-500 controller, a UV-1 monitor, and an MV-7
valve was used. The detector was set ateither 405 or 280 nm.
Kinetic studies on the polymerization of hemoglobins were carried
out in2.1 and 1.8 M phosphate buffers at 30 "C as described elsewhere
(3, 5, 6). Samples of mixtures of sickle and non-sickle hemoglobins
containing hybrid hemoglobin wereprepared by mixing the hemoglobins in 20 D M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, under aerobic conditions
and keeping the mixture in solution for at least 12 h. An aliquot of
the mixture was injected into an anaerobic cuvette containing deoxygenated 1.8 M phosphate buffer and Na2S2O4.Because the hemoglobins were converted to thedeoxy-form immediately, the hybrid hemoglobin stabilized (9). To prepare mixtures wherein hybrids were not
formed, a small volume (10 p l ) of non-sickle hemoglobin solution in
the oxy-form was first injected into an anaerobic cuvette containing
Na2S20, (10 mg) and 2 ml of 1.8 M phosphate buffer at 0 "C, and
A single amino acid substitution can change solubility, then the same volume (10pl) of oxy-Hb S solution was added to the

Comparative Studies of Hbs Mutated at the @6 Position

Polymerization of deoxy-Hb Machida-Previously we reported that oversaturated solutions of deoxyhemoglobins A,
C, and S polymerized with a delay time, suggesting that Val
at the p6 position is not necessarily essential for nucleidependent polymerization (3, 4). We found that deoxy-Hb
Machida (Glu41nSB)polymerized with a distinct delay time
(Fig. 4). The polymers of deoxy-Hb Machida melted quickly
upon cooling to 0 "C, as did those of deoxyhemoglobins A, C,
and S (3, 6). The relationship between the log of reciprocal
delay time uersus that of total hemoglobin concentration was
linear. The slope, an n-value, for the delay time in 2.1 M
phosphate buffer was 1.3. The n-value for deoxy-Hb Machida
depends on phosphate molarity, as with deoxyhemoglobinsA,
S, and C (3, 5, 6).
The solubility of the oxy- and deoxy-forms of Hb Machida
in 2.3 M phosphate buffer at 30 "Cwas compared with that of
hemoglobins A, C, and S (Table I). The solubility depends on
the phosphate concentration: the lower the phosphate concentration, the higher the solubility. The solubility of deoxyHb Machida is lower than that of deoxy-Hb A but approximately 50 times higher than thatof deoxy-Hb S. The solubilities of deoxy-Hb Machida and deoxy-Hb S were compared
in 1.8and 2.3 M phosphate buffers, since deoxy-Hb S is salted
out completely in phosphate buffers with concentrations
higher than 1.9 M at 30 "C (4).The solubilities of the oxyand deoxy-forms of Hb A, Hb C , Hb S, and Hb Machida are
summarized in Table I. It is noteworthy that the relative
solubilities of oxyhemoglobins decrease with increases in the
hydrophobicity of the amino acid at the86 position. It should
also be noted that the solubility of a hemoglobin differs,
depending on whether it is measured after gelation or crystallization. For instance, the solubility of deoxy-Hb C after
gelation is about 130 mg/dl and after crystallization is 0.8
mg/dl.
Polymerization and Solubility of the Mixtures of Sickle and
Non-sickleHemoglobins Mutated at the p6 Position-The
effect of the p6 amino acid on the kinetics of polymerization
was studied using equimolar mixtures of Hb S and Hb A, Hb
C, or Hb Machida (Fig. 5). When two hemoglobins are mixed
in the oxy-state, the tetramersrapidly dissociate into dimers,
which reassociate randomly to form hybrid hemoglobin molecules (9). The formation of hybrid hemoglobins from AS
mixtures in the deoxy-form in 1.8 M phosphate buffer was
proven to follow a binomial expansion using hydrophobic
interaction chromatography with a TSK-2000-SW column in
1.8 M phosphate buffer. The kinetics and solubilities of the
equimolar mixtures of SA, SC, and S-Machida under hybridforming conditions are similar (Figs. 5 and 6). The lines for

DISCUSSION

Relationship between Hydrophobicity of Individual Amino
Acids and Surface Hydrophobicity of Hemoglobin MutantsThe configuration and solubility of proteins are determined
by their amino acid composition (15, 16). The surface hydrophobicity of a protein naturally is determined by the type of
amino acid on the surface of the molecule. We investigated
the effect of the p6 amino acid on the solubility, surface
hydrophobicity, and the ease of gelation and crystallization
using hemoglobins with various mutations at thep6 position.
To determine the degree of hydrophobicity of an amino acid,
we used the values measured by the free energy of transfer
from an aqueous environment to organic solvent (17,18). The
hydrophobicities expressed in kcal/mol for valine, glutamine,
glutamic acid, and lysine are -1.5, 0.2, 2.5, and 3.0, respectively (18). Hydrophobicity of hemoglobin wasdetermined by
measuring the elution volume of hemoglobins by hydrophobic
interaction chromatography (5, 19, 20). The capacity factor
of hemoglobin wascalculated by Equation 1in this paper. We
found that the stronger the surface hydrophobicity of the @6
amino acid, the greater the elution volume of the mutant.
The plots of the capacity factor of these mutants in 1.8 M
phosphate buffer versus hydrophobicity of free amino acids
at the @6position show a linear relationship (Fig. 7A). This
indicates that the surface hydrophobicity of these hemoglobins, whichhave various mutations at the (36 position, is
determined by the hydrophobicity of the free amino acid.
Relationship between Surface Hydrophobicity and Solubility
of Hemoglobin-The plots of the log of the solubility of
oxyhemoglobins A, C, Machida, and S showed a linear relationship with their capacity factors (Fig. 7, A and B). A similar
linear relationship was shown for deoxyhemoglobins A, C,
and Machida but not for deoxyhemoglobin S (Fig. 7B). The
extremely low solubility of deoxy-Hb S may be attributed to
the stereospecific protein-protein interaction between Valm
of one molecule and Phew and Leuom of the neighboring
molecule in the U-shaped EF region (21).
The concentration and chemical nature of salt are known
to affect the salting-out phenomenon and the elution volume
of proteins when using hydrophobic interaction chromatography (20). For various salts at high concentrations, the
retention timeon the column and solubility of a given protein
usually parallels the Hofmeister series (20, 22-24). The solubility of proteins correlates with the electrostatic and hydrophobic effects of salts in the solvent. There is an inverse
relationship between these two effects (25). At sufficiently
high salt concentrations, the hydrophobicity of protein will
be the principal determinant of solubility. Melander and
Horvath (20) proposed a simple theoretical framework to
account for the dual role of saltin hydrophobic affinity
chromatography and solubility of proteins. They studied the
relative surface hydrophobicity of proteins andsuggested that
the salting outof protein is not only useful in thequantitative
analysis of hydrophobic interactions but also in the measurement of hydrophobic properties of proteins. Our present results support thisconclusion.
With hydrophobic interaction chromatography, the hydrophobic amino acids which are located on the surface of the
protein molecule form hydrophobic bonds with nonpolar

FIG. 7. Relationship between the hydrophobicity of amino
acid and solubility and capacity factor. The values for hydrophobicity of amino acids were assigned byHopp and Woods (18).The
solubilities of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobins ( B ) were measured in 2.3
and 1.8 M phosphate buffers, respectively. The hydrophobicity calculated by the capacity factor (A) was determined by Equation l in
the text. The experimentalconditions for the elutionvolume of
hemoglobins are the same as those described in Fig. 1.
chains on the gel matrix. The amino acid at j36 is one of the
external residues on the hemoglobin molecule, therefore, its
hydrophobicity greatly influences surface hydrophobicity and
the solubility of hemoglobin. As described in another report
(4), the elution volumes of the oxy- and deoxy-forms of various
hemoglobins are the same, indicating that the p6 position at
the A-helix is unaffected by the R and T transition. In
contrast, the solubility of deoxyhemoglobin is always lower
than that of oxyhemoglobin, indicating that the R and T
transition of hemoglobin affects protein-protein interaction.
The ease of polymerization and the extremely low solubility
of deoxy-Hb S cannot be explained by the hydrophobicity of
ValSG (Fig.8). It appears that the stereospecific interaction
between Valm and Pheaa and Leum plays a predominant role
in stabilizing the supermolecular structure of deoxy-Hb S
polymers.
Role of the Amino Acida t the p6 Position during Polymerization-Early studies of Allison (26) and Murayama (27)
indicated that thepolymerization of sickle hemoglobin molecules involves hydrophobic bonding. Later studies showed
that electrostatic and hydrogen bonds are also involved in the
polymerization of deoxy-Hb S (21, 28-30). Thus, the formation of the sickle polymers is complex and must involve
various chemical interactions. It has been shown that oversaturated solutions of deoxyhemoglobins A, C, and S in high
and low phosphate buffers form gels after a delay time (3, 4,
6). The critical point for gelation depends on phosphate
concentration. Our previous kinetic studies using various oxyand deoxyhemoglobinsdemonstrated that theValae indeoxyHb S is not responsible for the delay time prior to gelation
but simply decreases the critical concentration for gelation

(3, 4, 6). Our present results on the polymerization of Hb
Machida further support this concept.
Incorporation of Non-sickle Hemoglobins in Hb S Polymers-Bunn et ~ l (31)
. reported that there is no significant
difference in the kinetics of polymerization and solubility
between hemoglobinSA and SC mixtures in 0.15 M phosphate
buffer. Bookchin and Balazs (32) made a similar observation
in buffers with ionic strengths higher than 0.08 M phosphate
buffer. Our present results on the kinetics and solubility of
SA and SC mixtures in 1.8M phosphate buffer were consistent
with the results obtained in low phosphate buffer regardless
of whether experiments were done under hybrid-forming or
nonforming conditions. This can be explained by the fact that
only one of the two /36 valines is involved in polymer formation
as suggested by previous studies (31, 33). As shown by x-ray
analysis, one Valo6makes a lateral contact,mainly with PheDa
and LeuSSsof the opposite /3 chain. Therefore, 50% of the
hybrid hemoglobin will behave as Hb S while the other 50%
behaves as non-sickle hemoglobin. In other words, in a 1:l
mixture of Hb S and Hb A, all of the Hb S and half of
asymmetrical hybrid hemoglobin can participate in nuclei
formation while Hb A and the other
half of hybrid hemoglobin
are completely excluded. This explains why variations in the
amino acid at the/36 position do not affect the kinetics of the
nucleation prior to polymerization of these mixtures. It also
explains the similarity of results obtained for the kinetics of
polymerization under hybrid-forming and non-hybrid-forming conditions using mixtures containing50% Hb S and 50%
non-sickle hemoglobin. This result indicates that therelative
Lya*Or )nI'
and
probabilities for nucleation of

If this assumption can be applied to both nucleation and
polymerization steps, polymers should contain 25% non-sickle
hemoglobin under hybrid-forming conditions. However, we
found that the polymer phase contained 35 38% of nonsickle hemoglobin if the percentage of non-sickle hemoglobin
was determined by the filtration method. Whether non-sickle
hemoglobins are incorporated into thepolymer phase or those
in the polymer phase are contaminated by non-sickle hemoglobins in the solute phase is unknown. Previous workers
reported that under non-hybrid forming conditions, about
20% non-sickle hemoglobin was incorporated in the polymer

phase (34, 35). This is consistent with the present result
obtained in high phosphate buffer from the direct analysis of
the polymer phase. These results conflict with recent results
obtained by solubility experiments (31, 36). For instance, in
experiments with SA and SC mixtures, solubility analysis
suggested no copolymerization of Hb A or Hb C with Hb S
polymers (31, 36). More detailed analysis using a theoretical
model in which there is copolymerization of the hybrid tetramers cy2p@
and a~/3'/3*but no copolymerization of a& and
/3&$ molecules best fits actual solubility data (31).
We studied the possibility of copolymerization of non-sickle
hemoglobins from determinations of solubility of mixtures
under hybrid-forming conditions in 1.8 M phosphate buffer
(Fig. 6). Assuming that thesolubility of deoxy-Hb S in 1.8 M
phosphate buffer is 20 mg/dl (dotted line in Fig. 8) and that
20% of non-sickle hemoglobin and 50% of AS hybrid hemoglobin copolymerize with Hb S, the solubility of 1:l mixtures
of sickle and non-sickle hemoglobins should follow line B in
Fig. 8. In contrast, if only Hb S and half of the hybrid
hemoglobin polymerized, results should be as shown by line
A in Fig. 8. Our actual results confirmed the latterhypothesis,
indicating that non-sickle hemoglobins may not be incorporated inthe polymer phase. The non-sickle hemoglobinsfound
in the polymer phase (-20%) may represent contamination
by the solution phase. This assumption can explain why we
obtained similar results in kinetic experiments done under
hybrid-forming and nonforming conditions.
Recently, Ferrone et QZ. (37) proposed a double nucleation
mechanism, in which polymerization is initiated in the bulk
solution phase (homogeneous nucleation), followed by polymer formation on the surface of existing polymers (heterogeneous nucleation). According to thistheory, once even a small
amount of Hb S polymerizes, additional polymers are formed
rapidly by the heterogeneous nucleation process. As a result,
the delay time depends on both the rateof nucleation and the
rate of polymerization (37, 38). If non-sickle hemoglobins do
not participate in nucleation or polymerization, the kinetic
results under non-hybrid-forming conditions should be similar to those obtained under hybrid-forming conditions (Fig.
5). These results suggest that the kinetics of polymerization
in high phosphate buffer also follows the double nucleation
mechanism proposed by Ferone et ~ l (37).
