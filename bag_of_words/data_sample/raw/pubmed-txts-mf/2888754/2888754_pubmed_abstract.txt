Surface hydrophobicity, stability, solubility, and kinetics of polymerization were studied using hemoglobins with four different amino acids at the beta 6 position: Hb A (Glu beta 6), Hb C (Lys beta 6), Hb Machida (Gln beta 6), and Hb S (Val beta 6). The surface hydrophobicity increased in the order of Hb C, Hb A, Hb Machida, and Hb S, coinciding with the hydrophobicity of the amino acid at the beta 6 position. Solubility of the oxy-form of these hemoglobins decreased in relation to increases in their surface hydrophobicity, suggesting that the solubility is controlled by the strength of hydrophobicity of the amino acid at the beta 6 position. The solubility of the oxy-form of these hemoglobins is always higher than that of the deoxy-form. There is a similar linear relationship between the solubility and surface hydrophobicity among deoxyhemoglobins A, C, and Machida. However, the solubility of deoxy-Hb S deviated significantly from the expected value, indicating that the extremely low solubility of deoxy-Hb S is not directly related to the hydrophobicity of the beta 6 valine. Kinetic studies on the polymerization of deoxy-Hb Machida revealed a distinct delay time prior to polymerization. This confirms our previous hypothesis that beta 6 valine is not responsible for the delay time prior to gelation. The kinetics of the polymerization of 1:1 mixtures of sickle and non-sickle hemoglobins were similar to those of pure Hb S, suggesting that only one of the two beta 6 valines is involved in an intermolecular contact. In mixtures of equal amounts of Hb S and Hb A, Hb C, or Hb Machida, half of the asymmetrical AS, SC, and S-Machida hybrid hemoglobins behaved like Hb S during nucleation, while the other half behaved like the non-sickle hemoglobin.
