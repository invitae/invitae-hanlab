ABSTRACT
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD;
D-glucose-6-phosphate:NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.49)
A(-) is a common variant in Blacks that causes sensitivity to
drug- and infection-induced hemolytic anemia. A cDNA library
was constructed from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cells from a male who was G6PD A(i-). One offour
cDNA clones isolated contained a sequence not found in the
other clones nor in the published cDNA sequence. Consisting of
138 bases and coding 46 amino acids, this segment of cDNA
apparently is derived from the alternative splicing involving the
3' end of intron 7. Comparison of the remaining sequences of
these clones with the published sequence revealed three nucleotide substitutions: C33 _) G, G202-. A, and A376 -. G. Each
change produces a new restriction site. Genomic DNA from five
G6PD A(-) individuals was amplified by the polymerase chain
reaction. The base substitution at position 376, identical to the
substitution that has been reported in G6PD A( +), was present
in all G6PD A(-) samples and none of the control G6PD B( +)
samples examined. The substitution at position 202 was found
in four of the five G6PD A(-) samples and no normal control
sample. At position 33 guanine was found in all G6PD A(-)
samples and seven G6PD B(+) control samples and is, presumably, the usual nucleotide found at this position. The
finding of the same mutation in G6PD A(-) as is found in
G6PD A( +) strongly suggests that the G6PD A(-) mutation
arose in an individual with G6PD A(+), adding another
mutation that causes the in vivo instability of this enzyme
protein.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; D-glucose-6phosphate:NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.49) is an X
chromosome-linked enzyme that, in humans, is subject to
enormous genetic variability. The normal enzyme is designated G6PD B(+). In West Africa and among American
Blacks two mutant enzymes are very prevalent, G6PD A( +)
and G6PD A(-). Both of these enzymes have the same
electrophoretic mobility in standard systems, and 25 years
ago Porter et al. (1) suggested that both were due to the same
structural mutant, differing only in a closely linked regulatory
gene. At the time we pointed out that this probably would not
prove to be the case (2) because of emerging evidence that
subtle differences existed between the residual enzyme in
G6PD A(-) and G6PD A(+) individuals. More recently
Babalola et al. (3) conducted detailed kinetic studies of G6PD
A( +) and G6PD A( -) and suggested that the latter variant
might have been derived from the former.
Yet the very similar, or identical, electrophoretic properties of these two common variants and the strong correlation
that exists between the frequency of the GdA and GdAgenes in African populations (4) (the locus for these alleles is
now designated G6PD) has remained a tantalizing puzzle that

could not be approached directly until development of the
modem techniques of molecular cloning. We now describe
the molecular cloning and sequence analysis of cDNA for
G6PD A(-)* and show that this common variant has been
derived from G6PD A(+) as a result of an additional,
superimposed mutation. Moreover, we find that, presumably
as a result of alternative splicing, there is considerable
heterogeneity among different G6PD cDNAs. An abstract of
some of these investigations has been published (5).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials. Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcrip-

tase was obtained from Molecular Genetic Resources
(Tampa, FL). Oligo(dT)12.18, oligo(dT)-cellulose and EcoRI
linkers were from Pharmacia. 32P-labeled nucleotides were
purchased from New England Nuclear. Taq DNA polymerase was obtained from Perkin Elmer Cetus (Norwalk, CT),
and restriction endonucleases and other enzymes were from
New England Biolabs. Other reagents used were of analytical
grade.
Construction of cDNA Library. An Epstein-Barr virustransformed lymphoblastoid cell line was established from
peripheral lymphocytes from a Black male that is G6PD
A(-). Authenticity of the G6PD variant was verified by
G6PD activity assay and starch gel electrophoresis (6, 7).
Two x 108 cells were harvested, and the total RNA was
extracted by the guanidine thiocyanate method (8). Poly(A) +
RNA was prepared by oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography (9).
Beginning with 20 ,Ag of poly(A)+ RNA, cDNA was
prepared by a standard method (10) slightly modified by
adding Escherichia coli DNA ligase during second-strand
synthesis (11). Long cDNAs were selected by fractionation
on a Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) column and then ligated to
EcoRI-cleaved, dephosphorylated AgtlO DNA (Promega Biotec, Madison, WI). In vitro packaging was done using
commercially available packaging extracts, Gigapack Plus
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).
Isolation of cDNA Clones and DNA Sequencing. Approximately 1.0 x 106 recombinant phages from the unamplified
library were screened by plaque hybridization (12) with a
900-base-pair (bp) cDNA probe and a synthetic oligonucleotide probe (17-mer). The cDNA probe (which contains 620
bp of coding sequence) was obtained from a fibroblast cDNA
library from a G6PD B( +) individual using a 20-mer oligonucleotide probe. Positive phage clones were amplified by a
large-scale liquid culture (10) and digested with EcoRI. The
inserts were purified by electrophoresis and subsequently

inserted into the EcoRI-cleaved Bluescript M13 + vector
(Stratagene).
Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method (13) using 7-deaza-2'deoxyguanosine triphosphate (7-deaza-2'-dGTP) instead of
dGTP (14). The circular single-stranded DNA serving as
template of the reaction was prepared by denaturation of
double-stranded DNA by alkali. In addition to primers for
each T3 and T7 promoter site in Bluescript DNA, 19 different
17-mer oligonucleotides corresponding to various unique
sequences in G6PD cDNA were used as primers. The
sequence obtained was compared with the published normal
human G6PD cDNA sequence (15, 16). The position of a base
was indicated by the numbering system in the sequence
published by Persico et al. (16) (Table 1).
Analysis of Genomic DNA. Genomic DNA from five G6PD
A( -) and seven normal males was isolated from white blood
cells (17). Four of these G6PD A(-) subjects were American
Blacks and one was Mexican. The diagnosis of G6PD A( -)
was based upon enzyme activity, electrophoretic mobility,
and ethnic origin. Appropriate DNA sequences were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (18) with Taq DNA
polymerase (19) according to a protocol by Chehab et al. (20).
The synthetic oligonucleotide primers used for polymerase
chain reaction are summarized in Table 2. For sequencing
some oligonucleotide primers were labeled with 32P at the
5'-end by means of the polynucleotide kinase reaction. The
amplified DNA samples were digested with the appropriate
restriction endonuclease according to the supplier's conditions. The digested and undigested DNA fragments were
separated by 10 or 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and visualized by silver staining (21) or autoradiography. The
authenticity of amplified DNA sequences was verified by the
direct sequencing by the method of Maxam and Gilbert (22).

RESULTS
Isolation of cDNA Clones. A cDNA library prepared from
poly(A) + RNA derived from lymphoblastoid cells with G6PD
A( -) transformed by Epstein-Barr virus was screened using
a cDNA probe. Eighteen positive clones were obtained in the
first screening. Two successive screenings were done with
the same probe to isolate homogeneous positive plaques.
Finally, 15 positive clones were isolated. Of these 15 positive
clones, four clones hybridized with an oligonucleotide probe
corresponding to the midpoint sequence of coding region of
normal human G6PD cDNA. The insert sizes of these four
clones designated A-7, A-19, A-12, and A-15 were estimated
at 2.3, 2.2, 1.9, and 1.5 kilobase pairs (kbp), respectively, by
agarose gel electrophoresis.
Nucleotide Sequence. All of the four positive clones were
subcloned into Bluescript M13 + vector, and the nucleotide
sequence of both strands was determined as shown in Fig. 1.
The longest clone, A-7, had an entire coding and 3' noncoding
region and a short 5' noncoding sequence that consisted of 14
nucleotides. Clone A-19 also contained the entire coding and
a short 5' noncoding sequence with a 3' noncoding region
slightly shorter than that of clone A-7. Both A-12 and A-15
clones contained only a partial coding sequence. Surprisingly, the coding regions of A-7 and A-19 clones were found
to be of different lengths. Although clone A-19, consisting of

1548 bases, was exactly the same length as that previously
recorded for the normal G6PD cDNA (16), clone A-7 had an
extra 138 bases located just after G770. An open reading frame
was maintained through this extra sequence, coding 46
additional amino acids and extending part way into the intron
(23) (Fig. 2). Neither of the two clones, A-12 and A-iS,
possesses such extra bases.
The sequences of 3' noncoding regions of the four cDNA
clones are almost identical with that presented by Persico et
al. (16).
When compared with the published sequence (16) the
coding region of A-7 had three base substitutions, located at
nucleotide positions 33, 202, and 376. As summarized in
Table 1 each results in an amino acid substitution.
Analysis of Genomic DNA. To verify that the altered
sequence in G6PD A(-) was a consequence of the base
substitutions in the genomic DNA and to examine additional
subjects, genomic DNA was amplified and examined by
restriction endonuclease analysis and/or direct sequencing.
Positions 202 and 376 were examined in DNA samples from
five G6PD A(-) and five control G6PD B(+) individuals
(two Whites, two Blacks, and one Oriental). Position 33 was
examined in DNA from these and from two additional
Whites.

amplified with 5'-labeled primer 3 and

Fig. 3A shows a typical autoradiogram of this analysis: The
amplified DNA from two G6PD A( -) subjects was cleaved
to 46-bp and 63-bp fragments (the latter is not visible because
of its lack of labeled 5' end). The existence of this base
substitution was also confirmed in three G6PD A( -) subjects
by direct sequencing of the amplified DNA. Three of the four
Black G6PD A(-) subjects and the Mexican G6PD A(-)
subject were found to have this substitution.

58-bp and 32-bp fragments that were not seen in normal DNA
samples (the latter is not visible).
The base substitution C33 -> G was analyzed using 70-bp

DISCUSSION
The structure of normal human G6PD has been extensively
studied in recent years. Complete amino acid sequence (15)
and nucleotide sequence of both cDNA (15, 16) and of a
portion of genomic DNA (23) have already been elucidated.
Very little is known about the structure of G6PD variants.
However, Yoshida (24) and Takizawa et al. (25, 26) have
determined the molecular abnormality of G6PD A(+) as a
single-amino acid substitution of

Asn

to

a

single-base change of adenine to guanine.
In the present study, we isolated G6PD A(-) cDNA and
found three base substitutions in the coding sequence when
compared with published data (16). Great care must be taken
in interpreting an altered sequence in cDNA because irrelevant genetic polymorphism or cloning artifacts could cause a
base change. Therefore additional genomic DNA samples
from five unrelated G6PD A( -) subjects were examined, and
we

Because the low enzyme activity of A( -) variant is considered to be due to low stability in red cells (27, 28), this
mutation probably causes the instability of the enzyme
protein. The expected very slight change of net charge of a
G6PD molecule caused by this amino acid change might
correlate with the similar electrophoretic mobilities of G6PD
A(+) and G6PD A(-). That G6PD A(+) and G6PD A(-)

contain the same mutation strongly suggests that the latter
occurred in a carrier of the former mutation as predicted by
Babalola et al. (3).
The existence of a Black individual with G6PD A(-)
encoded by genes in which the A376 -- G substitution is
present but the G202 - A mutation is absent suggests the
possibility of this individual having undergone another mutation that caused instability and thus deficiency of the
electrophoretically rapid enzyme. We have not yet been able
to verify the biochemical characteristics of the G6PD of this
individual. Modiano et al. (29) reported the existence of two
types of G6PD B(+) and G6PD A(+), respectively, and
speculated that two types of G6PD A(-) might also exist.
Probably the mutation in G6PD A(+) (A376 - G) has an
ancient origin, and several different superimposed mutations
could have subsequently occurred in the G6PD A( +) population.
The third base substitution found in G6PD A(-) cDNA,
C33 -) G, was also found in all other DNA samples, both from
G6PD A(-) and G6PD B(+). Although there is still the
possibility that this base substitution is related to a widely
distributed polymorphism, it might, rather, be derived from
the base alteration in Persico's original cDNA sequence (16)
due to a polymorphic base substitution or a cloning artifact.
Discrepancy between the amino acid sequences of the
amino end of normal G6PD determined directly from peptides
(15) and that deduced from nucleotide sequence (16) is an
unsolved puzzle. Another discrepancy is also recognized in
the 3' noncoding sequence of cDNAs reported from two
laboratories: 3' noncoding sequence reported by Takizawa et
al. (15) is more than two times longer than that reported by
Persico et al. (16). Considering that the reported sequences
were determined from different tissues, these heterogeneities
are probably due to alternative splicing of G6PD mRNA in
different tissues. The existence of additional bases coding an
extra 46 amino acids in clone A-7 is of great interest in
considering such alternative splicing. Because this extra
sequence is located precisely between the sequences derived
from exons 7 and 8 and the nucleotide sequence of the 3' end
is identical with the published partial sequence of intron 7
(23), we concluded that the extra bases are derived from the
3' end of that intron. Existence of the extra sequence by such
alternative splicing in only one cDNA clone of four different
clones suggests that this phenomenon is unrelated to the
abnormal function of G6PD A(-) variant; more likely, it
represents the existence of multiple forms of G6PD molecule
in lymphoblastoid cells. More detailed studies of this alternative splicing will be reported elsewhere.
Note Added in Proof. It has now been possible for Dr. Josef Prchal
(University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL) to obtain an additional
blood sample from the southern United States Black male whose
DNA was normal at nucleotide 202. We confirmed the sequence data
on a new DNA sample from this subject, and Dr. Prchal again showed
that enzyme deficiency was present and that the residual red cell
enzyme was electrophoretically indistinguishable from G6PD A( -).
However this individual's G6PD differed from G6PD B(+) and
G6PD A( -) in its deamino NADP utilization, pH-activity curve, and
thermal stability. Meanwhile, we have examined four other putative
G6PD A( -) DNA samples, and all have had the nucleotide G202 -.
A substitution. In view of these additional findings it is possible that
the one subject that did not conform to the nucleotide pattern found

Proc. NaM Acad Sci. USA 85 (1988)
in the other G6PD A( -) individuals represented a sporadic mutation
occurring in a G6PD A(+) gene; it is not yet clear whether G6PD
A( -) is actually polymorphic at the DNA sequence level.
We thank Dr. Josef Prchal for making available to us DNA from
some G6PD A( -) individuals. This work is supported by National
Institutes of Health Grants HL-25552 and RR00833. This communication is publication 5147BCR from the Research Institute of Scripps
