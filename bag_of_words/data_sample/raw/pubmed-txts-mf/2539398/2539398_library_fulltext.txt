Abstract
Fabry disease, an X-linked recessive disorder of glycosphingolipid catabolism, results from the deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, a-galactosidase. Southern hybridization
analysis of the a-galactosidase gene in affected hemizygous
males from 130 unrelated families with Fabry disease revealed
six with different gene rearrangements and one with an exonic
point mutation resulting in the obliteration of an Msp I restriction site. Five partial gene deletions were detected ranging in
size from 0.4 to > 5.5 kb. Four of these deletions had breakpoints in intron 2, a region in the gene containing multiple Alu
repeat sequences. A sixth genomic rearrangement was identified in which a region of about 8 kb, containing exons 2 through
6, was duplicated by a homologous, but unequal crossover
event. The Msp I site obliteration, which mapped to exon 7,
was detected in an affected hemizygote who had residual enzyme activity. Genomic amplification by the polymerase chain
reaction and sequencing revealed that the obliteration resulted
from a C to T transition at nucleotide 1066 in the coding sequence. This point mutation, the first identified in Fabry disease, resulted in an arginine356 to tryptophan3% substitution
which altered the enzyme's kinetic and stability properties.
The detection of these abnormalities provided for the precise
identification of Fabry heterozygotes, thereby permitting molecular pedigree analysis in these families which revealed paternity exclusions and the first documented new mutations in
this disease.

Introduction
Fabry disease, an X-linked recessive disorder, results from the
deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, a-galactosidase
(a-galactosidase; EC 3.2.1.22) (1). The enzymatic defect in
this lysosomal storage disease leads to the accumulation of
glycosphingolipids with terminal a-linked galactosyl moieties, the primary substrate being globotriaosylceramide (galactosyla 1 -l 4galactosylB1- 4glucosylB1-- 1' ceramide) (2).
In affected hemizygous males, the progressive glycosphingolipid deposition, primarily in the plasma and in lysosomes of
the vascular endothelium, leads to the major clinical manifestations of the disease, including angiokeratoma, acroparestheAddress reprint requests to Dr. Desnick, Division of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Fifth Avenue at

sias, and vascular disease of the kidney, heart, and brain (1).
Before the advent of renal dialysis and transplantation, many
affected males did not survive past the fourth decade oflife (3).
In contrast, most heterozygous females are clinically asymptomatic or have minimal symptomatology and live a normal
life span (1).
Biochemical confirmation of clinically suspect hemizygous
males can be accomplished definitively by demonstration of
deficient a-galactosidase activity in various sources including
plasma, leukocytes, tears, and cultured cells (4-6). Prenatal
diagnosis of at-risk male fetuses can be made reliably by demonstration of the enzymatic defect in fetal cells obtained by
amniocentesis or chorionic villi sampling (e.g., 7, 8). In contrast, enzymatic identification of female carriers of the Fabry
gene is less reliable inasmuch as heterozygotes can express
levels of a-galactosidase activity ranging from essentially zero
to normal owing to random X-chromosomal inactivation (9,
10). In fact, obligate heterozygotes have been reported with
normal levels of a-galactosidase activity and the absence of the
characteristic keratopathy (1 1, 12), which has been observed
by slit-lamp microscopy in 70% of obligate heterozygotes
(1). In addition, recent evidence suggests that inactivated Xchromosomal genes may become reactivated as a result of
aging and decreased levels of 5-methyldeoxycytidine (13-15).
Thus, the demethylation and subsequent reactivation of Xchromosomal genes may explain the not infrequent observation that older obligate heterozygotes have levels of a-galactosidase activity in the high end of the heterozygote range or
within the normal range (D. F. Bishop and R. J. Desnick,
unpublished results). Clearly, this recently recognized aging
phenomenon may further obscure precise enzymatic diagnosis
of heterozygotes.
Human a-galactosidase is a homodimeric glycoprotein
with a mature subunit molecular weight of 46 kD (16-19).
Biosynthetic studies using polyclonal antibodies produced
against the purified human enzyme indicated that the a-galactosidase subunit is normally synthesized as a precursor glycopeptide of 50 kD. After cleavage of the signal peptide and
carbohydrate modifications in the Golgi and lysosomes, mature enzyme subunits of 46 kD form the active, homodimeric
enzyme (20, 21). In Fabry disease, early studies revealed the
presence of nonfunctional, immunologically cross-reactive
enzyme protein in some classically affected hemizygotes (with
essentially no detectable enzymatic activity), while others had
no detectable enzyme protein (22, 23). Rare, atypical variants
with residual a-galactosidase activity and milder phenotypes
had enzyme protein (24-28), however, the amounts were not
quantitated. More recent studies of a-galactosidase biosynthesis in fibroblasts from unrelated Fabry hemizygotes demonstrated the occurrence of several types of enzyme defects (21).
These included: (a) no detectable synthesis of the enzyme precursor, (b) synthesis of an unstable precursor protein, and ab-

sence of the mature enzyme, (c) synthesis of a mutant precursor of normal size followed by abnormal processing of the
mutant enzyme subunit to the mature lysosomal form, and (d)
normal precursor synthesis and processing of the mutant enzyme protein. These findings suggested the occurrence of a
variety of mutations including gene rearrangements and point
mutations which affect a-galactosidase synthesis, maturation,
and stability, as well as subunit association and/or kinetic
properties.
Recently, the full-length cDNA and genomic sequences
encoding human a-galactosidase have been isolated and characterized (29, 30). The full-length cDNA encodes a precursor
peptide of 429 amino acids including a signal peptide of 31
residues. The genomic sequence is approximately 12 kb in
length, contains seven exons ranging in size from 92 to 291 bp
(30), and has been mapped to the region Xq2 1.33 a Xq22 by
in situ hybridization (V. R. Potluri et al., unpublished results).
In this communication, we describe the use of the full-length
cDNA and genomic restriction maps (30) to identify the first
molecular lesions in the ca-galactosidase gene which cause
Fabry disease. Evaluation of 130 unrelated Fabry families revealed six gene rearrangements and an exonic point mutation,
the latter resulting in the obliteration of an Msp I restriction
site in this X-linked housekeeping gene.

Methods
Cell lines. Skin biopsies and peripheral blood samples were obtained
from Fabry family members with informed consent. Cultured fibroblast lines were established using standard techniques and were grown
in Weymouth's media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco,
Grand Island, NY). Lymphoid cell lines were established with Epstein-Barr virus, using cyclosporin A to increase the efficiency of
transformation (31), and maintained in RPMI 1640 media containing
10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 1% penicillinstreptomycin (Gibco).
Enzyme studies. The enzymatic diagnosis of affected hemizygotes
and of heterozygotes for Fabry disease in each family was determined
by assaying the 4-methylumbelliferyl-a-galactosidase activity in
plasma, isolated granulocytes and lymphocytes, or cultured fibroblasts
and lymphoblasts as previously described (4-6) with the following
modifications. The standard reaction mixture consisted of 25 Ail of
enzyme source and 150 Ml of substrate solution which contained 5 mM
4-methylumbelliferyl-a-D-galactopyranoside (Koch-Light, Haverhill,
England) and 117 mM N-acetylgalactosamine (U.S. Biochemical
Corp., Cleveland, OH) in 0.1 M citrate/0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH
4.6. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 15 min (cell extracts) or 2 h
(plasma) and was terminated by the addition of 2.33 ml of 0.1 M
ethylenediamine. Studies of the residual a-galactosidase activity in the
plasma ofaffected hemizygotes from Family C included determination
of the apparent Km value and thermostability when preincubated at
40°C and pH 4.6 in 0.1 M citrate/0.2 M phosphate buffer, or at 40°C
and pH 7.4 in N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonate (Calbiochem-Behring Corp., La Jolla, CA) buffer. Aliquots were removed
for assay at time points during the 6-h preincubation period.
Southern hybridization analysis. For each subject, DNA was isolated from mixed peripheral leukocytes (from 20 ml of whole
blood), cultured fibroblasts or lymphoid cells (at least 106 cells) by the
method of Aldridge et al. (32), and was digested with Hind III, Msp I,
Pvu II, Sac I, or Taq I (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Accurate
quantitation of restriction-digested DNA samples was crucial for determining the nature and extent of the gene rearrangements in Families B and D. This was accomplished by the method of Brunk et al.
(33), as modified by Aldridge et al. (32), using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Accurate Chemical and Scientific, Westbury, NY).

Digested DNA samples were electrophoresed in 1% agarose, transferred to Zetabind transfer media (AMF-Cuno, Meriden, CT) or BioTrace RP charge-modified nylon 66 binding matrix (Gelman Sciences,
Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) by the method of Southern (34), and analyzed
with the a-galactosidase cDNA, which was nick-translated using Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs) and [a-32P]dATP, [a-32P]dGTP, [a-32P]dCTP, and [a-32P]dTTP (3,000 Ci/mmol;
Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL; 1 mCi = 37 GBq) (35). Nylon
membranes were exposed to film (XAR; Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) with intensifying screens (Cronex Lightening Plus; Dupont
Co., Wilmington, DE) at -760C for 1-6 d. Densitometric comparison
of hybridization signals was accomplished using a model GS 300 scanning densitometer with a Hewlett-Packard 3390A integrator (Hoefer
Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA).
Genomic amplification and sequence determination. Sense and
anti-sense oligonucleotide primers were synthesized on a model 380B
DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to regions
flanking the Msp I site in exon 7. The anti-sense oligonucleotide was a
29-mer (TCTAGAGGATCCTCACAGGGAGGAGCTGT) constructed complementary to 17 bases of exon 7 sequence (nucleotides
[nt]' 1155-1171) and contained an additional 12 nt which included a
Bam HI site. The sense oligonucleotide also was a 29-mer (GATTACGAATTCTGCTTGATAGTTCTGAC) which contained 17 nt of intron 6 sequence and an Eco RI site. Amplification of genomic DNA
from Family C hemizygotes or normal individuals was achieved by the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Taq polymerase (Cetus Corp.,
Emeryville, CA) using a modification of the method of Saiki et al. (36).
The amplification reaction mixture contained 2 Mig of denatured genomic DNA in 100 Ml of 67 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 16.6 mM (NH4)2SO4,
6.7 mM MgCl2, 10% dimethylsulfoxide, 10 mM fl-mercaptoethanol,
33 MM each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP, 170 Mg/ml bovine
serum albumin (Pentax fraction V; Miles Laboratories Inc., Naperville, IL), and 0.6 Mg each of the sense and anti-sense primers. The
reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 15 min to allow annealing
of the primers to genomic DNA, then Taq I polymerase (1 U) was
added and polymerization was carried out for 5 min at 60°C. Subsequent cycles were performed by denaturation at 90°C for 60 s, cooling
at room temperature for 60 s to allow for primer reannealing and
polymerization at 60°C for 5 min. This was repeated 25 times with
additional Taq polymerase (1 U) added at cycles 10 and 20. After
phenol and chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the amplified DNA was digested with Eco RI and Bam HI, ligated into linearized M13 (37), and used to transform competent JM109 cells.
Clones containing the amplified fragment were identified by Southern
hybridization using a 17-mer oligonucleotide constructed to an internal sequence in exon 7 (nt 11 18-1134) and sequenced by the dideoxy
chain termination method (38) with a 17-mer oligonucleotide primer
(TGCTTGATAGTTCTGAC) corresponding to the intron sequence
used for amplification.
Computer-assisted analysis of hydropathy and local secondary
structure. Hydropathic indices for both the normal and mutant enzymes were determined by the algorithm of Kyte and Doolittle (39)
and local secondary structure was predicted by the method of Chou
and Fasman (40) using the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group software developed by Wolf et al. (41). A region of 40
amino acids surrounding the site of the Arg356 to Trp356 amino acid
substitution (i.e., residues 336-376) was used for the analysis of regional secondary structure.

Results
Southern hybridization analysis of genomic DNA from 130
unrelated Fabry hemizygotes identified six gene rearrangements including five different partial gene deletions and one

partial gene duplication. Each gene rearrangement was detectable with the four restriction enzymes routinely employed for
screening genomic DNA (i.e., Msp I, Pvu II, Sac I, and Taq I).
These mutations resulted in the absence of any detectable agalactosidase activity in plasma and/or cell sources from the
affected hemizygotes, all of whom manifested the classical disease phenotype. In addition, an Msp I restriction site obliteration was observed in genomic DNA from a seventh unrelated
Fabry family. The fact that this affected hemizygote had residual a-galactosidase activity initially suggested that the Msp I
site alteration was in the coding sequence. For further characterization of these lesions, cultured lymphoid or fibroblast
lines were established from all available family members and
DNA was isolated for molecular pedigree analyses.

Partial gene deletions
Fig. 1 shows the structural organization of the a-galactosidase
gene, the restriction fragments which are detectable by Southern hybridization analysis using the full-length cDNA as a
probe, and the relative positions of each of the partial gene
deletions. It is notable that in four of these families (Families
A, B, E, and F) a deletion breakpoint was mapped to intron 2,
a region of the a-galactosidase gene which contains multiple
Alu repeat sequences (Fig. 1). In the Southern hybridization
analyses shown for each deletion (Figs. 2-6), a restriction enzyme was selected to clearly distinguish the mutant allele for
molecular pedigree analysis.
Family A. Pvu II-digested DNA from the two affected
hemizygotes (I-1 and 1-5) had the normal 3.6- and 2.3-kb fragments and lacked the normal 6.9-kb fragment, the latter replaced by a unique 2. 1-kb fragment (Fig. 2). These findings,
together with those from restriction analyses with the other
enzymes (data not shown), indicated a partial gene deletion of
4.8 kb at the 5' end of the gene (Fig. 1). In this family, the
unique 2. 1-kb Pvu II fragment in female members would definitively identify heterozygotes for the mutant allele. The near

Family E. As shown in Fig. 4, the normal 2.5-kb Sac I
fragment was replaced by a unique 2.1-kb fragment in the
affected hemizygote (III-1), indicating a partial gene deletion
of 400 bp (Fig. 1). The presence of both the normal 2.5-kb
and unique 2.1-kb Sac I fragments in the proband's mother
(II-2) was consistent with heterozygosity for the partially deleted allele. The fact that the proband's sister (III-2) had a
normal Sac I profile excluded the possibility that this woman
carried the mutant allele. Of note was the observation that the
proband's maternal grandmother also had a normal Sac I profile and that her husband had expired at age 64 yr from carcinoma of the stomach. Since survival of a Fabry hemizygote
beyond 60 yr has not been reported (1), it is likely, but not
certain, that the mutation in this family arose de novo in the
germ-line of one of the maternal grandparents.

normal levels of a-galactosidase activity in the two obligate
heterozygotes (II-1 and II-2, the daughters of affected males),
were initially presumed to reflect random X-chromosomal inactivation (9, 10). However, the absence of the diagnostic 2.1kb Pvu II fragment in their DNA provided molecular evidence
for paternity exclusion. Nonpaternity for II-1 and 11-2 was
confirmed by HLA haplotype analyses.
Family B. In this family, Southern hybridization of Pvu
II-digested DNA was most informative. The normal 6.9-, 3.6-,
and 2.3-kb Pvu II fragments were not detected in genomic
DNA from the affected hemizygote, 11-2 (Fig. 3). Only a
unique 8.0-kb fragment (derived from the 5' portion of the
normal 6.9-kb fragment) was observed indicating a partial
gene deletion of> 5.5 kb including the 3' end of the a-galactosidase gene and extending an undetermined distance into the
3' flanking region (Fig. 1). The presence of the unique 8.0-kb
fragment, and hybridization signals for the normal 2.3- and
3.6-kb Pvu II fragments consistent with dosage for one normal
and one mutant allele, permitted the precise molecular identification of heterozygotes (I-1, II-4, 11-5, 111-2, 111-4).

Figure 2. The partial gene deletion in Fabry Family A. Southern hybridization analysis of Pvu II-digested DNA demonstrated the absence of the normal 6.9-kb fragment and the presence of a unique
2.1-kb fragment in the affected hemizygotes (I-1 and 1-5). Note that
the daughters (II- I and II-2) of the affected hemizygotes did not have
the unique 2. 1-kb fragment or dosage for the 6.9-kb fragment. These
findings indicated nonpaternity.

identified readily by the absence of the normal 4. 1-kb Hind III
fragment and the presence of a unique 2.4-kb fragment (Fig.
5), consistent with a partial gene deletion of 3.2 kb (Fig. 1).
Heterozygotes for the mutant allele were detected definitively
by the presence of both the mutant 2.4-kb and normal 4. 1-kb
fragments (I-5, II- 1). In addition, the inheritance of the mutant
allele in the other at-risk females (1-7, 1-8, 11-4, II-5) was excluded by the absence of the unique 2.4-kb fragment.
Family J. Based on Southern hybridization analyses with
all four restriction endonucleases, the gene rearrangement in
the affected hemizygote deleted 1.5 kb of the 3' end of the
a-galactosidase gene and possibly extended into the 3' flanking
region (Fig. 1). Molecular pedigree analysis in this family was
best accomplished using Hind III-digested DNA (Fig. 6). The
affected hemizygote (IV-1) had a unique 7.6-kb Hind III fragment which replaced the normal 5.7-kb and 4. 1-kb fragments.
The presence of the unique 7.6-kb fragment identified his
mother (111-2) and sister (IV-2) as heterozygotes. Of particular
note was the fact that neither maternal grandparent (II- 1, 11-2)
had the mutant allele; nonpaternity of the maternal grandfather was excluded by HLA typing of cultured lymphoid lines
and by the analysis of restriction fragment length polymor-

applied to the gel and visualized after ethidium bromide staining

the molecular documentation of a new mutation in this family, which was suggested previously on the basis of enzyme
assays (42).
A partial gene duplication
As shown in Fig. 7, the affected hemizygote (11-4) had a unique
5.5-kb Pvu II fragment in addition to all of the normal fragments. Similarly, an additional 4.0-kb fragment was detected
in Sac I-digested DNA from the affected hemizygote (not

Sac I
Figure 4. The partial gene deletion in Fabry Family E. Southern hybridization analysis of Sac I-digested DNA revealed the absence of
the normal 2.5-kb fragment and the presence of a unique 2. 1-kb
fragment in the affected hemizygote (III- 1). The proband's mother
(11-2) had both the normal 2.5- and unique 2. 1-kb Sac I fragments
consistent with heterozygosity, while the maternal grandmother (I-1)
did not, suggesting that this deletion arose de novo. The maternal
grandfather expired at age 64 of stomach cancer and samples were
not available for analysis.

definitively identified heterozygotes in this family. In addition
to the unique 5.5-kb Pvu II fragment, densitometric analysis
revealed a disproportionately increased autoradiographic signal for the 2.3-kb Pvu II fragment in the Fabry hemizygote.
Compare the signal intensities for affected hemizygote II-4 and
his normal brother II-5 (Fig. 7). Densitometry of the autoradiographic signals for obligate heterozygotes (II-1 and II-2)
suggested triple dosage of the 2.3-kb Pvu II fragment compared
to that in normal males. These data and similar data for Sac I
indicated the occurrence of a gene rearrangement in this family resulting from the duplication of exons 2-6, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 8.
An exonic point mutation
Characterization of the defective enzyme in various sources
from affected hemizygotes in Family C revealed residual a-galactosidase activity with altered kinetic and stability properties
(Table I). The 4-methylumbelliferyl-a-D-galactosidase activity
was 30% of normal in plasma whereas the activity in cells
ranged from 1% to 3% of normal mean values. Compared to
the activity in normal plasma, the residual plasma activity
from the affected hemizygotes had a fourfold higher apparent
Km value and was five times more thermostable at 40°C and
pH 7.4, accounting for the presence of significant residual activity in the circulation. In contrast, the residual enzyme had a
half-normal thermostability at 40°C and pH 4.6, consistent

with the low activity in cells presumably due in part to the
instability of the enzyme at lysosomal pH.
Southern hybridization analyses of DNA from affected
hemizygotes digested with Taq I, Sac I, and Pvu II demonstrated normal profiles, whereas Msp I-digested DNA revealed
the presence of a unique 2.0-kb fragment and the absence of
the normal 1.5- and 0.51-kb fragments (Fig. 9; IV-l and IV-4).
The presence of the unique 2.0-kb Msp I fragment permitted
the molecular diagnosis of heterozygotes for the mutant allele.
In contrast, the enzymatic diagnosis of family C heterozygotes
in plasma was difficult due to the enzyme's increased half-life,
and in cells primarily due to random X-chromosomal inactivation. For example, routine a-galactosidase assays of plasma
from heterozygotes I-1, III-2, and IV-3 revealed levels of 10.6,
18.7, and 6.6 nmol/h per ml, respectively, which were within
the normal range (n = 64) of 6.2 to 28.5 nmol/h per ml. The
a-galactosidase activities in peripheral lymphocytes isolated
from heterozygotes III-2 and IV-3 were 30.0 and 63.6 nmol/h
per mg, respectively, also within the normal range (n = 20) of
21.5-48.9 nmol/h per mg.
Since only one Msp I site was present in the full-length
cDNA (29), recently localized to exon 7 (30), it was reasoned
that the obliterated Msp I site was the mutation which resulted
in the residual defective a-galactosidase activity in Family C
hemizygotes. To test this hypothesis, a genomic DNA region
which included the Msp I site in exon 7 was amplified by the
PCR technique using Taq polymerase. After 25 cycles of amplification, the 264-bp genomic fragment was subcloned into
Ml 3 for sequencing. As shown in Fig. 10, a C -- T transition
was identified at nt 1066 of the coding sequence (30) which
resulted in an arginine to tryptophan amino acid substitution

nor father (II- 1) of heterozygote 111-2 had the 7.6-kb fragment, indicating the occurrence of a new mutation in this family. Nonpaternity

was not found in any
other unrelated Fabry hemizygote, nor in 174 normal alleles
examined (43, 44); therefore, this base substitution was not a
polymorphism. Computer-assisted analysis of the region surrounding the amino acid substitution (residues 336-376) revealed a marked increase in hydrophobicity and predicted an
altered local secondary structure with an increased tendency to
form an a-helical conformation (Fig. 1). These structural
changes presumably altered the kinetic and stability properties
of the residual mutant enzyme.

Discussion

Southern hybridization analysis of the a-galactosidase gene in
130 Fabry families revealed seven genetic lesions, of which six
or 4.6% were gene rearrangements. Compared with other Xlinked disease genes, the frequency of gene rearrangements in
the a-galactosidase gene was similar to the 6% values reported
for the ornithine transcarbamylase and factor VIII genes
(45-47), less than half the 11% in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene (48, 49), and much lower than the
40-80% of mutations in the genes for factor IX and dystrophin
(50-52).
Of the human gene rearrangements identified to date, the
precise breakpoint junctions have been characterized in relatively few (e.g., 53-59). However, a notable finding has been
the occurrence of Alu repeat sequences at the breakpoint junctions, suggesting that these sequences may be mechanistically
involved in the generation of these rearrangements. Approxi-

Figure 7. Identification of a partial gene duplication in Fabry Family
D. Southern hybridization of Pvu Il-digested DNA revealed the presence of a unique 5.5-kb fragment in addition to all the normal fragments in the affected hemizygote (11-4). Analogously, Sac I-digested
DNA revealed an additional unique 4.0-kb fragment in affected hemizygotes (not shown). The presence of the 5.5-kb Pvu II or the 4.0-kb
Sac I fragments identified heterozygotes in this family (1-3, II- 1, 11-2,
11-6). Note that the molecular studies confirmed the prenatal diagnosis of a normal male fetus (arrow), which had been diagnosed by
the a-galactosidase activity in amniotic fluid cells. The occurrence of
the unique fragments, in addition to all normal fragments and the
densitometric demonstration of dosage for the 2.3-kb Pvu II fragment (compare affected hemizygote II-4 to his normal brother II-5)
indicated a partial duplication (see Fig. 8).

Figure 10. Sequence analysis of point mutation in Fabry Family C.
After amplification of the target sequence by PCR, the 264-bp sequence containing the Msp I restriction site at bp 1065-1068 was
subcloned into M 13 and sequenced by the dideoxy chain-termination method of Sanger et al. (38). In contrast to the normal sequence
at this site (CCGG; left), which encodes an arginine residue, a C -o T
transition at nt 1066 (CTGG; right) results in a tryptophan substitution at residue 356 in the mutant enzyme in Family C.

in the chromatin structure such that they are more likely than
unique sequences to undergo homologous, but unequal, crossover events (63). In fact, the proportion of Alu sequences per
kilobase may indicate the frequency of rearrangements expected for a given gene. In this regard, it is of interest that
intron 2 in the human a-galactosidase gene has multiple Alu
repeats (R. Kornreich, unpublished results). Thus, the localization to intron 2 of the breakpoint junctions for four of the
five partial a-galactosidase gene deletions is consistent with the
concept that Alu repeats are "hot spots" for gene rearrangement events, possibly because of their propensity to misalign
during meiosis. Further understanding of the mechanistic role
of the Alu repeats in the generation of human gene rearrangements may be gained by sequencing the breakpoint junctions
in the rearranged a-galactosidase alleles.
The first molecular demonstration of a point mutation in
the a-galactosidase gene, initially detected as an Msp I restriction site obliteration, was identified as a C -- T transition
using PCR to amplify a region of genomic DNA from the
Family C hemizygote for sequencing. CpG dinucleotides are
known mutational hot spots because cytosine in this position
can be methylated and then deaminated to thymidine (64).
Genes on the X-chromosome may be more susceptible to C -)
T transitions since methylation and demethylation of certain
CpG dinucleotides appear to be important for maintaining
X-inactivation in females (65-67). Point mutations resulting
from C -. T transitions have been documented in the Xlinked deficiencies of factors VIII and IX (68, 69) as well as in
autosomal disorders (70-74). Therefore, Msp I and Taq I were
chosen for the initial screening of genomic DNA from the
Fabry families. The finding of the Msp I site obliteration was of
particular interest since previous studies of affected hemizygotes in Family C revealed residual enzymatic activity (Table
I). In addition to the kinetic defect, the residual enzyme was
more thermolabile at lysosomal pH and more thermostable at
pH 7.4. The decreased lysosomal stability was consistent with
the disease phenotype whereas the increased stability at pH 7.4
accounted for the presence of the defective enzyme in plasma
at levels that could have led to a misdiagnosis ofaffected males
if only this enzyme source had been assayed.
Due to the C -- T transition, a tryptophan replaced the
normal arginine at residue 356. Compared to arginine, the

ity to accurately detect heterozygotes in these families led to
the molecular exclusion of paternity in two instances in Family A. The detection of nonpaternity was confirmed by HLA
typing in both cases. Thus, molecular pedigree analyses in
these seven families permitted precise heterozygote detection
which led to the identification of the first documented new
mutations in this disorder as well as paternity exclusions. Until
the specific mutations in the other Fabry families are identified, improved heterozygote detection can be accomplished by
the use of two polymorphic sites in the a-galactosidase gene
(43, 44) as well as by the use of closely linked random RFLPs

analysis of amino acid residues 336-376 in the normal (upper) and
Fabry Family C (lower) a-galactosidase subunits is shown. The Arg356

to form an a-helical conformation. R and W indicate the position of

aromatic tryptophan residue is bulkier, more hydrophobic,
and uncharged. Computer-assisted analyses of this amino acid
substitution predicted alterations in the hydropathy profile
and secondary structure in this region of the protein, presumably accounting for the unique properties of this mutant enzyme. To date, PCR analysis of other a-galactosidase exons in
Family C hemizygotes has not revealed the presence of another
lesion, supporting this C-T transition in the a-galactosidase
coding sequence as the site of the disease-causing mutation.
The identification of these seven a-galactosidase mutations
by Southern hybridization analysis permitted molecular pedigree analyses in these families. Since precise heterozygote
identification by analysis of gene product quantity or function
is difficult in X-linked recessive disorders due to random Xchromosome inactivation (9, 10), the ability to detect the mutant allele obviates this problem. Thus, it was possible to determine the ancestry of the mutant allele in Families E and J,
permitting the first demonstration at the molecular level of de
novo mutations in Fabry disease. In each of these families, the
mutations could be traced to a heterozygote whose mother and
father each had normal a-galactosidase alleles based on DNA
analyses and/or by the demonstration of normal a-galactosidase levels in plasma and cell sources. Nonpaternity was excluded in Family J; however, in Family E, the proband's maternal grandfather had expired at age 64, so paternity could not
be documented. These findings suggest that the mutant alleles
in each of these families arose either sporadically in a gamete
of one of the proband's normal maternal grandparents or that
one of the maternal grandparents was a germinal mosaic for
the mutant allele. Similar molecular pedigree analyses to determine the origin of deletions in the factor VIII (47) and
hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (48) genes indicated
that new mutations in X-linked disorders could arise in the
gametes of either maternal grandparent. In addition, the abil-
