Abstract
Sandhoff disease is caused by mutations affecting the (3 subunit
of lysosomal fl-hexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52) and displays a
wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes. We report a 57-year-old
patient with a very mild phenotype, although residual hexosaminidase A activity in his cultured fibroblasts was < 3% of
normal activity, a level observed in juvenile onset patients.
Northern and Western blot analyses confirmed a similar low
level of d subunit-mRNA and mature fl-protein, respectively.
Two mutations of the HEXB gene were identified in this patient, a partial 5' gene deletion (a null allele), and a C -- T
transition 8 nucleotides downstream from the intron 10/exon
11 junction affecting the splicing of the (3 subunit-mRNA. In
their homozygous forms, the 5' deletion has been previously
shown to result in a severe infantile phenotype, and the C -0 T
transition in a juvenile phenotype. The genotype and the low
level of residual hexosaminidase A activity would be expected
to produce a juvenile Sandhoff phenotype in this patient, as
well as in four of his six clinically normal siblings. The biochemical basis of his mild phenotype is uncertain, but may result
from genetic variations in the RNA splicing machinery. (J.

Introduction
There are two major (-hexosaminidase isozymes in normal
human tissues, hexosaminidase A (af) and hexosaminidases B
(33). Tay-Sachs disease is caused by mutations in the HEXA
gene which encodes the a subunit unique to hexosaminidase A.
Sandhoff disease results from HEXB gene mutations which
affect the common a subunit. Thus, patients with Sandhoff
disease have deficiencies of both isoenzymes. The small
amount of residual enzyme activity (< 1%) in tissues of these
patients is from the labile a homodimer, (3-hexosaminidase S
(aa) . The stored substrate responsible for the severe neurological disorders characteristic of hexosaminidase A deficiencies is
GM2 ganglioside. The a subunit supplies the catalytic site for

GM2 hydrolysis (assayable with the artificial substrate 4-methylumbelliferone-(3-N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate [4-MUGS])
(1 ), and the (3 subunit confers stability to the active dimer. The
(3subunit also contains an active site that is primarily responsible for hydrolyzing neutral substrates; e.g., oligosaccharides
(assayable with the artificial substrate 4-methylumbelliferone-

fl-N-acetylglucosamine [4-MUG]) ( 1 ) which are stored and/
or excreted in elevated amounts only in Sandhoff disease (reviewed in [2, 3]).
Like other lysosomal storage diseases, Sandhoff disease presents a wide range of clinical phenotypes, from the most severe
infantile form (reviewed in [2 ]) to an adult form in which the
primary symptoms are progressive motor neuronopathy (4)
(Table I). Sandhoff suggests that as little as 10% of the normal
level of hexosaminidase A is compatible with a normal life; i.e.,

it represents the "critical threshold" of activity necessary to
prevent GM2 storage, and that patients with the infantile onset
form lack any residual activity towards GM2 ganglioside. Variations within the 1-10% range ofnormal activity may be responsible for the majority of the less severe phenotypes (2, 5, 6).
There have been more than a dozen mutations in the
HEXA gene described (reviewed in [3, 7]). However, only a
few HEXB mutations have been characterized. Surprisingly,
one of these, a 16-kb deletion of the 5' end, accounted for 27%
of the Sandhoff alleles we analyzed (8). This deletion allele is
incapable of transcription due to the absence of the 5' promoter
region, and in the homozygous form (line GM 294, Table I)
produces a severe infantile phenotype (9). A patient with the
juvenile phenotype (line GM 2094, Table I) was found to be a
genetic compound of the deletion mutation (8) and a G -) A
transition in intron 12. The latter creates an alternate splice site
and the inframe insertion of eight codons; i.e., 24 nucleotides
(10, 11 ). A third mutation, found in an asymptomatic individual with low enzymatic activity, involves a duplication of a
region encompassing the junction of intron 13 and exon 14.
This defect generates an alternate splice site and an inframe
insertion of six codons ( 1). In the juvenile and asymptomatic
individuals, a low level of properly spliced (3 subunit-mRNA
(which would produce preprofl-polypeptides with the normal
(3-primary structure), produces 3-6% and 9-10% of normal
hexosaminidase A activity, respectively ( 11).
Recently, a novel splicing mutation has been identified in a
Japanese patient with juvenile Sandhoff phenotype (Japanese
patient, Table I). The patient, whose parents were first cousins,
was shown to be homozygous for a C -) T transition in exon
1. Abbreviations used in this paper: CRM, cross-reactive material;

11. This mutation, located eight nucleotides downstream from
the intron IO/exon 11 junction, impaired mRNA splicing.
Two abnormally spliced transcripts were characterized and
shown to produce premature stop codons, which are presumably responsible for their instability ( 12). A small amount of
normally spliced mRNA was detected in the patient's cells.
Because of the C - T transition, the resulting polypeptide
contained an amino acid substitution, Pro417 -> Leu. A second
mutation was also found, an A -* G transition in exon 2. This
mutation, which results in conversion of Lys121 - Arg, was
thought to be a benign polymorphism, for COS cell expression
of a fl-cDNA encoding both the Lys,212 Arg and the Pro417 -O
Leu substitutions produced levels of intracellular hexosaminidase B activity similar to that of the wild type cDNA. The
authors concluded that the splicing mutation (intron IO/exon
11 C -- T transition) alone is responsible for the observed
clinical phenotype ( 12).
In this report, we describe a patient with a very mild disease
(line 2557, Table I) whose genotype and low residual enzymatic activity was considered predictive of much more severe
juvenile Sandhoff disease. We demonstrate that the patient is a
genetic compound of the infantile 5' deletion mutation (8) and
the juvenile intron IO/exon 11 C - T mutation. The patient's
fibroblasts contain < 10% of normal # subunit-mRNA levels
and are totally deficient in hexosaminidase B activity; however,
they retain 2% of normal hexosaminidase A activity. Despite
these data, this individual is 57 years old and has few clinical
symptoms. Enzyme analysis of the patient's six clinically unaffected siblings indicated that four of them (ages 51-62 yr) are
also genetic compounds for the same two Sandhoff alleles. The
variable phenotype associated with the intron 10/exon 11 C -*
T transition indicates that other unidentified factors determine
the pathological outcome of this mutation. We speculate that
the severity of the effect of the mutation on the levels of properly spliced f subunit-mRNA may be determined by individual variations in the RNA splicing machinery.

Methods
Case report. The subject was a 57-yr-old non-Jewish French-Canadian
who presented in 1986 with a 9-yr history of severe watery diarrhea,
intermittent moderate and diffuse abdominal pain, 17-kg weight loss
over a 7-yr period, and increasing weakness. Cholecystectomy was
carried out 6 yrs previously without any improvement.
The only other abnormalities found during physical examination
were lower limb hyperreflexia and impaired thermal sensitivity of legs
and arms. The patient also reported a few episodes of faintness and
dizziness, usually improving in the supine position but occasionally
leading to syncope, intolerance to warm weather due to impaired
sweating, impaired sexual function since 1975 and complete impotence since 1978, and mild urinary incontinence. These findings suggested some impairment of the autonomic nervous system.
Extensive investigations of the gastrointestinal tract carried out between 1980 and 1984 (six hospitalizations), including upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy with biopsies, retrograde cholangiopancreatography, barium studies of the upper gastrointestinal tract,
abdominal ultrasound and computed tomographic scan, and extensive
hormonal work up, were all normal. [14C]Cholylglycine breath test
suggested accelerated intestinal transit speed. '4C excretion peaked
early (3 h after ingestion; normal 4-6 h), and its total excretion was
9.3% of the ingested dose (normal 4%).
A rectal biopsy taken at the H6pital Saint-Lazare, Paris, France in
1986, and reviewed by Pr. Modigliani, showed the presence of membranous cytoplasmic bodies (MCBs) in the intestinal neurons. The

patient was referred to the Service de Genetique Medicale, H6pital
Sainte-Justine, Universite de Montr6al, for further study.
The patient (II-7, Fig. 1 ) is one of seven siblings. One of his sisters,
age 58 (11-3, Fig. 1), has also complained of diarrhea for the last 10 yr
and of postural dizziness for 5 yr. Clinical investigations similar to
those described above were carried out with normal results. There has
been no reported change in the state of our patient or any ofhis siblings
during the past 5 yr.
Measurements of residual hexosaminidase isozymes and urinary
oligosaccharides. Fibroblasts (three T-75 flasks) derived from normal
individuals and patients with Sandhoff disease were harvested and
lysed in buffer that contained 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 4M DTT,
10-3M EDTA, and 5% glycerol within 3 wks of reaching confluence.
Protein was determined by the method of Lowry. Separation of the
fl-hexosaminidase isozymes (Hex B, Hex A, and Hex S) was accomplished by chromatofocusing and the hexosaminidase activity in each
fraction determined by assay with 4-MUG as previously reported (4,
9). Alternatively, hexosaminidase A (aB) and B ((3j3) were separated
from hexosaminidase S (aa) by immunoprecipitation with sheep anti# antiserum coupled to Protein G Sepharose (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Div. of Pharmacia Inc., Piscataway, NJ) as previously described
( 13 ). The hexosaminidase A bound to the beads was assayed directly
using the a-specific substrate 4-MUGS ( 14). The total precipitated
hexosaminidase activity (A and B) was assayed with the common 4MUG substrate. The hexosaminidase isozymes in plasma and leucocytes were assayed with 4-MUG by the thermodenaturation assay
method ( 15). Oligosaccharides in a 24-h urine collection were determined by thin-layer chromatography ( 16).

Western blot analysis. Samples ofcell lysates (Table I) were individually mixed with sample buffer containing 3% SDS and 25 mM DTT,
and incubated at 60'C for 15 min. The proteins in each sample were
separated by SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli gel system ( 10% gel) ( 17 ).
The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose overnight ( 13 ). Nitrocellulose was blocked by exposure to 5% skim milk in Blotto (10 mM
Tris base, 150 mM NaCI, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5) for 4 h with gentle
shaking, then incubated with a 1:800 dilution ( 1% skim milk in Blotto)
of rabbit anti-# IgG, overnight. Nitrocellulose was washed 4x with 1%
skim milk in Blotto and incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution ( 1% skim
milk in Blotto) of goat anti-rabbit IgG/horse radish peroxidase conjugated (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) for 1 h. The nitrocellulose
was then washed 4X 15 min with 1% skim milk in Blotto, quickly
rinsed with Blotto (no skim milk), and dried between filter papers. It
was then incubated in equal volumes of Detection reagent 1 and Detection reagent 2 (ECL system; Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL)
for precisely 1 min, dried briefly on filter papers, covered with Saran
wrap, and exposed to Hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham) for 1 min.
Cell culture. Fibroblast cells were cultured in a-minimal essential
medium (MEM; Flow Laboratories) supplemented with streptomycin,
penicillin (100 mg/I each), and 10% fetal calf serum at 370C under
5% CO2.
Preparation of genomic DNA. Cultured fibroblast cells, grown to
confluency in 6 X 150 cm2 culture dishes, were harvested in PBS by
scraping with a rubber policeman. The cells were centrifuged at 2,000
rpm for 10 min and the pellet resuspended in 2 ml TE buffer (10 mM
Tris-HCI, pH 8/1 mM EDTA). An equal volume of TE/0.2% SDS
was added and the tube inverted gently to lyse the cells. The DNA was
extracted with phenol, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in
distilled H20 to 0.5% ughld for amplification by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR).
Preparation of whole cell RNA. Total cellular RNA was prepared
from cultured fibroblast cells by the guanidinium isothiocyanate
method ( 18) followed by CsCl ultracentrifugation. Northern blot analysis was carried out as previously reported (4, 9).
Reverse transcription ofRNA. Single-stranded cDNA was prepared
from 6 ,g total cellular RNA by incubation at 420C for 60 min with 25
U of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT; Bethesda Research Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), 5 U of RNAguard' (Pharmacia. LKB Biotechnologies) and 0.5 gg oligo-dT in 50

mM f3-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM each offour dNTP's. The cDNA was
precipitated by the addition of 1/ 10 vol 3 M sodium acetate (pH 4.8)
and 2 vol of absolute ethanol, vacuum desiccated, and resuspended in
50 Ml sterile distilled H20 for amplification by PCR.
PCR. Amplification of exonic and intron/exon junctions from genomic DNA, and cDNA segments was performed by the PCR procedure, using the oligonucleotide primers as described previously (12).
The reactions were performed in 100 Ml vol containing 0.1-0.5,Mg genomic DNA or 2 Ml cDNA, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5
mM MgCl2, 0.0 1% gelatin, 200,uM each offour dNTP's, 0.5 Mg of each
primer and 2.5 U AmpliTaq. Taq polymerase. Amplification was
achieved by incubation in a DNA Thermal Cycler" (Perkin Elmer
Cetus Instrs., Norwalk, CT) for 30 cycles, each consisting of a denaturation step at 94°C for 30 s, an annealing step at 55°C-65°C (usually at
5°C below the melting temperature (Tm) of the primers) for 30 s and
an extension step at 72°C for 1.5-3 min (depending on the length of
DNA to be amplified). 1 / 10th of the amplified products were analyzed
by agarose gel electrophoresis. All splice junctions and exonic sequences of the HEXB gene from cultured fibroblasts of patient 2557
were amplified and sequenced.
The region around exon 11, found to be heterozygous for the
Pro417 -* Leu mutation in genomic DNA was amplified by PCR using
oligonucleotides "528" (3' intron 9, sense; 5'-CACCTCTCAAAATGCAAGAA-3') and "529" (5', intron 11, antisense; 5'-AATGGTTGCTTCACTTACCA-3'). Oligonucleotide "52" (5'-CTCCAATCTTGTCCATAGCT-3') was used as a primer for direct
sequencing. A fragment of cDNA containing this region ofexon 11 was
amplified by PCR using primers " 18" (sense; 5 '-TGTTGGGAATCAAATCCAAAA-3') and "13" (antisense; 5'-CAGTCTGT-

Al vol of 0.1 M Tris-HCI (pH 8.3), 140 mM KCl,

CATAGGCGTCAT-3').
Genomic DNA from fibroblasts of a normal control and the subject
was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides "2- 1 " (3' intron 1, sense;
5'-GAGTTAACTACAATGTTACTAG-3') and "2-2" (5', intron 2,
antisense; 5'-GGAAGCTTAATAGGAATCATAAACTC-3'; a Hind
III site in the primer is underlined) in the region of exon 2 where the
Japanese patient was previously reported to have a second Lys121 -0
Arg substitution, as well as the same Pro417 -- Leu mutation (12) we
now report in our patient, 2557 (see Results). The product was sequenced directly using oligonucleotide 2-1 as primer. An area in exon 6
of genomic DNA from our patient, line 2557, was amplified and directly sequenced with primers "891" (3', intron 5, sense; 5'-AGACATATGGAAGGAATTCCAA-3'; an EcoRI site in the primer is underlined) and "892" (5', intron 6, antisense; 5'-AACTTGTAATGAAACTATACCCA-3'). cDNA was amplified in this region by PCR with
primers "15" (sense; 5'-GGTTTCTACAAGTGGCATCA-3') and
"10" (antisense; 5'-ATGTTGTATTCAGAGTAGGG-3').
Direct sequencing. In preparation for sequencing, DNA amplified
by PCR was purified from unincorporated primers and extraneous
bands by electrophoresis in an 8% polyacrylamide gel. The DNA was
excised and eluted overnight with shaking incubation at room temperature in distilled H20. DNA was freed of traces of acrylamide by passage
through siliconized glass wool and precipitated twice by addition of
1 / 10 vol sodium acetate (pH 4.8) and 2 vol absolute ethanol.
DNA was resuspended in 10 Ml distilled H20. Direct sequencing
was performed on 2-5 M1 samples with [ a 35SIdATP using a modification of the Sequenase" protocol (United States Biochemical Corp.
Cleveland, OH), by supplementing all buffers with 10% DMSO and 50
MM NaCl, as described by Winship (19). Samples were electrophoresed
in 6% polyacrylamide/ urea gels.

Results
The identification of MCBs in the patient's intestinal neurons
led to the investigation of residual hexosaminidase levels (by
the standard thermodenaturation assays [ 15 ]) in plasma (Fig.

total plasma hexosaminidase activity, and the percent of the activity
that is heat stable, (i.e., hexosaminidase B) is given for each family
member. Based on these assays, each individual is assigned a status,
i.e., normal (open symbol), carrier of one mutant HEXB allele
(striped symbol), and carrier of two mutant HEXB alleles (solid
symbol). The mother of our patient (1-2) is deceased, but is assumed
to have been a carrier, thus the different striped pattern. Normal
mean = 822 nmol/h per ml (total plasma hexosaminidase activity,
4-MUG); and 26% hexosaminidase B; normal range = 552-1374
nmol/h per ml, and 18-31% hexosaminidase B (by thermodenaturation).

lings, had total hexosaminidase levels within the range of patients with Sandhoff disease. Of these siblings, only II-3 has
shown some symptoms similar to those of our patient (see case
report); the others were asymptomatic.
The above activity data led to a more quantitative evaluation of the hexosaminidase isozymes in fibroblasts (line 2557)
from our patient, as well as an estimation of the relative steady
state level of mature (i.e., lysosomal, fi subunit protein [Western blot]). These data were compared to those obtained from
the fibroblasts of other patients with known genotypes and phenotypes (GM 2094, juvenile; 2400, adult; 2399, adult; and GM
294 infantile; Table I). The chromatofocusing separation of
the hexosaminidase isozymes from four of these cell lines
(2557, GM 294, GM 2094, and 2400) is shown in Fig. 2. The
isozyme pattern from our patient's cell lysate was virtually
identical to that of cell line GM 2094 from the juvenile Sandhoffpatient. Both of these lines clearly produced more residual
hexosaminidase A than did the infantile/deletion line, GM
294, and less than the cell line from the adult Sandhoff patient,
2400. The quantitation of the enzymatic activity levels is presented in Table II (Chromatofocusing). These results were corroborated by a solid state assay that selectively immunoprecipitates hexosaminidase A and B, but not hexosaminidase S (aa),
with an anti-,B antiserum (20), and then quantitates both isozymes using the common 4-MUG substrate, or quantitates
hexosaminidase A alone using the a-specific 4-MUGS as a substrate (Table II, Immunoprecipitation). Mature fl subunits
contained in lysates from all four patients' fibroblasts were undetectable when compared with similar amounts of total protein from a normal cell lysate (data not shown). However,
when the amount of lysate protein loaded from the patients'
cells was increased 20-100-fold over that loaded from the normal cell lysate, mature f, protein in the 28-kD range (13) was
detectable (Fig. 3). As was the case with the enzymatic activity,
when the variation in total protein load was taken into account
similar amounts of f protein were present in lysates from our
patient's cells and those from line GM 2094, larger amounts

deletion line GM 294.
The enzymatic and Western blotting data indicated the
presence of mutation(s) in the patient's HEXB gene. In order
to predict the type of mutation(s) that could be present we
determined the levels of a and is subunit-mRNA in the patient's fibroblasts by Northern blotting. Fig. 4 (panels "(3Hexosaminidase, a-chain" and "fl-Glucuronidase") demonstrates that levels of a-mRNA transcribed by the HEXA gene
and the control mRNA (encoding fl-glucuronidase (21) were
similar in the patient's cell line (lane 4), those of the normal
control (lane 1), and those from two sisters with adult onset
Sandhoff disease (lines 2399 and 2400; lanes 2 and 3) (4).
However, the level of ft subunit-mRNA in our patient's cells
was decreased to less than 10% of normal levels (Fig. 4, fl-Hexosaminidase, ,8-chain, lane 4). We initially determined that our
patient (line 2557) and the adult Sandhoff patients are heterozygous for the common partial 5' end deletion mutation (8).
As we have noted (8), Northern blotting at the level of exposure seen in Fig. 4 cannot detect differences in levels . 50% of
normal mRNA; i.e., the adult-onset patients appear to have

normal levels of (3 subunit-mRNA. However, the severely reduced level of( subunit-mRNA in our patient's cells, which is
similar to the levels of residual enzymatic activity and fl-crossreactive material (CRM), suggest that his second allelic mutation primarily exerts its detrimental effect by lowering the level
of( subunit-mRNA.
In order to identify the patient's second HEXB gene mutation, all exons and intron/exon junctions from his genomic
DNA were amplified by PCR and the resultant DNA sequenced directly. Only two changes from the normal sequence
were found, both in a heterozygous form. The first was a C G transition in the codon for Ser243 in exon 6, which would
result in its substitution by Cys (data not shown). The second
was a C -. T transition in the codon for Pro417 in exon 11 (Fig.
5). This transition was the same mutation found in a homozygous form in cells from the Japanese juvenile Sandhoff patient
with reduced (3 subunit mRNA levels (Table I). We suspected
the intron 10/exon 11 C -- T transition to be directly responsible for the lower (3 subunit mRNA levels in our patient. The
C -- G transition in exon 6 could result in a silent polymorphism or be present on the exon 1-5-deleted allele.

the C -. T transition in exon 11 were transcribed, we analyzed
the nucleotide sequences of our patient's cDNA in the regions
of the two substitutions. Amplification of the region encompassing the exon 6 transition produced a single fragment of the
expected length (data not shown). Direct sequencing of this
fragment showed that it contained only the nucleotide needed
to code for the wild type Ser residue (data not shown). Thus,
the C -* G transition is not transcribed and must reside in exon
6 of the partially deleted allele. On the other hand, amplifica-

similar in size to the two abnormally spliced ,B subunit-mRNA
species described in fibroblasts from the Japanese patient ( 12).
P1 was confirmed to be normally spliced subunit-mRNA by
direct sequencing. Its sequence contained only the mutant "T"
nucleotide at the codon for Pro417 (Fig. 7 A). As was the case
with the Japanese juvenile Sandhoffpatient ( 12 ), P2 displayed
a sequence corresponding to exon 10 spliced to a cryptic site
mid-way in exon 11 (a TGA premature stop codon is generated
six nucleotides after the junction (Fig. 7 B) and P3 displayed
the sequence of exon 10 spliced directly to exon 12 (Fig. 7 B) (a
premature stop codon would be generated 171 nucleotides
after the junction).
The cloned genomic DNA from the Japanese juvenile
Sandhoff patient was also reported to contain a point mutation

mal polymorphism ( 12). To determine if our patient also harbored this mutation, we amplified genomic DNA from line
2557 and from normal control leukocytes in the affected region
of exon 2. As shown by the sequence analysis in Fig. 8, DNA
from our patient contains only the normal Lys codon 121 (Fig.
8, Patient). Surprisingly, one of the HEXB alleles from a normal control was found to contain the Arg codon substituted at
position 121 (Fig. 8, Normal). Fresh serum and leukocytes
were isolated from the blood of the control individual (R.T.),
and they both were tested for total hexosaminidase activity and
percentage of hexosaminidase B (of the total) by the thermodenaturation assay (22, 23). The results from both sources of
enzyme were in the normal range (Table III). These data confirm that the Lys121 -> Arg substitution is a normal polymorphism. Furthermore, they suggest that the intron 10/exon 11
C -- T transition mutation in our patient's and the Japanese
patient's HEXB genes have arisen independently.

these we previously reported to be the common Sandhoff 5'
deletion allele which is not transcribed (8). Direct sequencing
of PCR fragments from genomic DNA and cDNA revealed
that the mutation in our patient's second HEXB allele is a C ->
T transition 8 nucleotides downstream from the intron 10/
exon 11 junction (Fig. 5). This mutation in the homozygous
form was shown to impair ,3 subunit-mRNA splicing in a Japanese patient with juvenile onset Sandhoff disease (12). The
accompanying amino acid substitution, Pro4,7 -. Leu was
shown to be a neutral change. It was demonstrated to have no
detrimental effects on hexosaminidase B activity in transfected
COS cells, and quantitation of the fl-mRNA (8% of normal)
correlated with the residual 8% activity level found in the Japanese patient's fibroblasts ( 12). However, amplification of this
region of our patient's cDNA produced three fragments (Fig.

the anti-sense sequences obtained for cDNA; from a normal individual (normal, A) with the three cDNA species obtained from patient
2557 (largest = 425 bp, A; middle = 313 bp, B; and smallest = 255
bp, B). The amplified product from normal cDNA was 425 bp, as
expected. The products were acrylamide gel-purified and sequenced
directly. The largest cDNA from patient 2557 displays a C -* T transition at the codon for Pro4,7 in exon 11 (indicated by * as a G A transition in the antisense sequence). This results in the substitution of a codon for Leu. In this product, exon 10 is correctly spliced
to exon 11 (A). The two smaller products display anomalous splicing.
2557 middle shows exon 10 spliced to a cryptic site midway in exon
11 (at Asp452), resulting in a frame-shift with a stop codon. 2557
smallest shows exon 10 spliced to exon 12, to the exclusion of exon
1 1. This also results in a frame-shift, which introduces a stop codon
171 bases downstream (A).

gested that it does not affect the transport or function of hexosaminidase B ( 12). Furthermore, in this report, we showed that
the Lys121 -- Arg substitution is present in the normal population. However, we cannot totally rule out the possibility that
this seeming polymorphism may exert a very small detrimental
effect on the binding the GM2 activator protein/GM2 ganglioside complex that is only significant in combination with the
Pro417 Leu substitution; i.e., a cis effect, resulting in the phenotype of the Japanese patient being more severe. This possibility
seems unlikely as the residue in question, Lys,2,, is not present
in the mature polypeptide (27), amino terminus Thr,22 (28),
and a Lys - Arg substitution should not affect proteolytic
processing. It should also be noted that the pro-hexosaminidase
A is fully active (29), thus GM2 ganglioside hydrolysis can occur with or without the presence of Lys121 in the 13 subunit.
Genomic DNA from our patient did not contain the above
Lys12, -- Arg substitution. This demonstrates that the intron
1O/exon 11 C - T mutation is present in two different genetic
backgrounds and, therefore, probably arose independently in
the Japanese and Caucasian populations. The observation that
this C -- T transition affects splicing in exactly the same novel

manner in two HEXB alleles from different genetic backgrounds supports the conclusion that this is indeed the cause of
the splicing error (thereby precluding the involvement of some
other unidentified substitution elsewhere in the allele).
The remaining anomaly is the delayed and mild course of
the disease in our patient. On the basis of comparison with the
Japanese patient, one would expect our patient to have a more
severe phenotype. Biochemical comparisons, such as residual
isozyme activities and fl-CRM in cultured fibroblasts were also
predictive of a juvenile onset phenotype. The only clinical evidence of Sandhoff disease in our patient was some indication of
disturbance of the autonomic nervous system. However, there
was direct evidence for GM2 ganglioside storage in the observation of MCBs in his intestinal neurons. The same type of MCBs
were noted in the Japanese juvenile ( 12) and the French-Canadian adult onset patients; e.g., cell line 2400(4). However, the
Japanese patient and the adult onset patients had additional
clinical symptoms indicating neurological and/or motor neuron involvement (Table I). Furthermore, our patient was not
found to excrete detectable amounts of neutral oligosaccharides (data not shown). Both the Japanese patient and the
adult Sandhoff patients were shown to excrete large amounts of
these compounds (4, 12) (Table I). As with 4-MUG hydrolysis, oligosaccharide hydrolysis is primarily accomplished by the
active site of the /3 subunit in hexosaminidase A and B ( 1).
Thus, it is even more surprising that our patient does not excrete oligosaccharides given the substantially lower residual
hexosaminidase activity and fl-CRM levels found in his fibroblasts, as compared to fibroblasts from the adult onset Sandhoff patient (Table II). These data suggest that our patient may
express variable levels of residual activity in different tissues;
i.e., above the critical threshold in most tissues including the
brain, kidney, and liver, but below the threshold in others, such
as intestinal and other autonomic neurons, and fibroblasts.
The reason for the above variations in phenotypic expression is unclear. One possibility is that tissue-specific differences
in our patient, and the overall clinical differences between him
and the Japanese patient, could result from small variations in
the level of properly spliced /3 subunit-mRNA. The splicing of
mRNA involves a large number of gene products (reviewed in
[30 ]) and this mutation is at a site not previously thought to be
part of the consensus sequence for splice junctions. It has also
been documented that the normal nucleotide sequence at the
intron 10/exon 11 junction in the HEXB gene does not fully
conform to the consensus sequence for a splice junction ( 31 ).
This is consistent with the observation of some (0.6%) abnormally spliced A subunit mRNA; i.e., P2, in amplified cDNA

from normal fibroblasts ( 12). Many examples of tissue-specific
differential splicing of mRNAs have been documented (reviewed in [32]) and it is therefore conceivable that different
tissues are able to splice mRNA with this novel substitution
better than others. Similarly, there may be small differences in
the overall splicing machinery between individuals or between
different racial groups. Whereas such differences may normally
produce only small variations in a given mRNA level, in this
circumstance, their effects could be amplified by the presence
of an unconventional splicing mutation coupled with a very
small critical threshold of normal /3 subunit translation, > 1020%, necessary to avoid the expression of a Sandhoff phenotype.
Our observations suggest caution to diagnosticians and genetic counselors dealing with lysosomal storage diseases. Resid-

ual enzyme activity values in plasma or individual tissues may
accurately reflect the general in vivo activity, particularly
when a partial mRNA splicing abnormality is the underlying
cause of the decrease in activity. In these cases, even the determination of the patient's genotype may not result in an accurate prediction of the ultimate phenotype.
