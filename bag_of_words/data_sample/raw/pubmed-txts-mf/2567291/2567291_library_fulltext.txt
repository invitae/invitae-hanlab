The S-type a1-antitrypsin (alAT) deficiency allele
differs from the normal M1(ValaI3)allele by a single
amino acid substitution ( G ~+uVal).
~ ~To~evaluate the
molecular pathophysiology responsible for thereduced
serum levels of alAT associated with the S-type
allele,
alAT gene expression was examined in blood monocytes, cells which normally produce alAT, as well as
murine fibroblasts modified by retroviral gene transfer to express the S-type and normal “type
human
a1AT genes. Northernanalysisand
S 1 protection
analysisdemonstrated that monocytes of M and S
homozygotes both express 1.8-kilobase a1AT mRNA
transcripts in comparable levels and similar in structure. Pulse-chase labeling studies demonstrated that
both M and S monocytes synthesized and secreted a
52-kDa protein, but theS monocytes secreted significantly less. The cellular lysatesof both M and S monocytes contained a newly synthesized 50-kDa precursor
form of alAT, but the S monocytes contained reduced
amounts. Pulse-chase labeling in the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of core oligosaccharide addition,
demonstrated that S monocytes exhibited a selective
inhibition of secretion of 45-kDa nonglycosylated
alAT not observed in M monocytes. Consistent with
these observations, murine fibroblastsmodified by retroviral gene transfer tocontain an integratedhuman
S-type alAT cDNA demonstrated reduced secretion of
alAT compared with fibroblasts containing an integrated human M-type a1AT cDNAand also reproduced
the abnormality of alAT biosynthesis observed with
S-type monocytes. Furthermore, in the presence of
leupeptin, an inhibitor of cellular proteinases, the S type modified fibroblasts demonstrateda selective augmentation of human alAT secretion not observed for
the “type. Together, these observations are consistent with theconcept that thesingle A + T mutation of
the S-typealAT gene results in reduced cellular secretion of alAT because the newly synthesized S-type
a l A T protein is degraded intracellularly prior to secretion.

duced by hepatocytes and mononuclearphagocytes, serves as
the major inhibitor of neutrophil elastase in the lower respiratory tract (I,2). In its secreted form,a l A T is composed of
394 amino acids and three carbohydrateside chains of the N linkedasparaginyltype
(3-5). Itsprincipalfunction is to
inactivate neutrophil elastase, a powerful serine protease capable of degrading the major components of the connective
tissue matrix (5, 6). When serum levels of a l A T are below
35%of normal, as occurs in the hereditary disorder a1AT
deficiency, there areinsufficient amounts to protect the
lower
respiratory tract from its burden
of neutrophil elastase, placing the affected individual at high risk for the development
of pulmonary emphysema (1, 2, 7, 8).
a l A T is coded for by a highly pleomorphic, single
copy gene
of 12.2 kb on chromosome 14 at q31-32.3 (2, 9). T h e a l A T
phenotype is determinedby codominant expression of the two
parental alleles (10-12). In USA Caucasians, the most common normal a l A T variants are those of the “family (combined allelic frequency, >go%) and the most common deficiency variants are the S-type (frequency 0.02-0.04) and the
Z-type (frequency 0.01-0.02) (1,2, 3, 10, 12, 13-17).
Unlike the Z variant, in which the mechanism responsible
for the deficiency state is understoodto result from intracellular aggregation of the aberrant molecule causing reduced
a l A T secretion (4, 18, 19), little is known as to why the S
allele is associated with reduced serum levels of a1AT. It is
known, however, that the coding exons of S-type a l A T gene
differ from the common normal Ml(Val2l3)-type a1ATgene
byasinglebase
(M1(Va1213)GAA + S GTA) causing the
amino acid substitution G ~ Z Vu a l ~(20-22).
~ ~ This knowledge, together with the observations that the S-type protein
has a normalserum half-life(23) and an association rate
constant for neutrophil elastase that is close to normal (24),
has led to the assumption that the GIuzfi4t o Val mutation
causes a deficiency in a l A T biosynthesis, resulting in deficient secretion of a l A T by a l A T synthesizing cells (4, 18).
To evaluate this concept, we have examined a l A T mRNA
transcripts and a1AT synthesis in mononuclear phagocytes
recovered from individuals homozygous for the S-type a1AT
gene. Then, using retroviral gene transfer to establish permanent murine fibroblast lines expressing the S-type and
normal M1(Va1213)-typehuman a l A T genes, we have reproduced the abnormalities observed in the alAT synthesizing
cells of the S homozygotes. Together, the observations are
consistent with the concept that the singleA
T mutation
in the S-type a1AT gene causesa serum a l A T deficiency
because the newly synthesized a l A T is degraded in a l A T
synthesizing cells prior tosecretion.
MATERIALSANDMETHODS

Source of al-Antitrypsin Synthesizing Cells-Blood monocytes,
cells that synthesize and secrete alAT (25, 26), were obtained from

normals ("type homozygotes),S-type homozygotes, and, ascontrols,
2-type homozygotes. The determination of the M, S, and Z states was
made by a combination of measurement of serum a l A T levels determined by radial immunodiffusion (Calbiochem), a l A T typing by
isoelectric focusing of serum, and family studies (1, 2, 10-12). The
normal individuals (n = 7) all wereof phenotype MM (i.e. various
combinations of the normal alleles M1(Va1'13), Ml(Ala2l3),M2, and
M3) (12) and had normal a l A T serum levels (295 35 mg/dl)." The
homozygous S-type alAT-deficient group included five individuals
with a l A T serum levels of 142 +_ 40 mg/dl. The homozygous Z-type
a l A T deficient group included two individuals with a l A T serum
levels of 34 & 6 mg/dl. The monocytes were isolated utilizing adherence purification of mononuclear cells obtained by monocytapheresis
as described previously (26).
RNA Analysis of Monocytes-alAT mRNA transcripts of the Stype and M-type monocytes were evaluated by Northern analysis, S1
nuclease protection analysis, and quantitative dotblot analysis. Total
cellular RNA was prepared from purified blood monocytes by guanidine hydrochloride extraction and CsCl centrifugation (26).
Northern analysis was carried out with agarose gel electrophoresis
under denaturing conditions, transfer to nitrocellulose filters, and
hybridization utilizing a 3ZP-labeledfull length human a l A T cDNA
plasmid probe (pPBO1). Exposure of the autoradiograms was for 48
h a t -70 "C.S1 nuclease analysis was carried out using total cellular
RNA hybridized under denaturing conditions for 3 h at 56 "C to a
1.4-kb single strand anti-sense a l A T cDNA probe complementary to
the protein coding regions of the a1AT gene. Digestion with S1
nuclease (200 units/ml; Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc.) was for
30 min at 37 "C. The resulting protected fragments were electrophoresed under alkaline conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose filters,
and detected by hybridization to a 32P-labeledfull length a l A T cDNA.
The resulting autoradiograms were exposed for 48 h a t -70 "C.
Quantification of steady state a l A T mRNA levels was performed
using dot blot hybridization (26). Total cellular RNA was denatured
and applied to nitrocellulose filters with a minifold apparatus
(Schleicher & Schuell) in serial dilutions of10-1.25pg. The filters
were hybridized as described above and the amount of specific hybridization determined by densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms with results expressed as densitometric units of a l A T mRNA/
pg total RNA.
Synthesis and Secretion ofalAT by Monocytes-The synthesis and
secretion of alAT by the monocytes was evaluated using [35S]methionine as a label and anti-human a1AT antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) immunoprecipitation of the supernatants and cell lysates for
the presence of 35S-labeleda1AT asdescribed previously (26).
Modification of Oligosaccharide Side Chain Addition and Processing-Modification of steps inoligosaccharide side chain addition and
processing of the a l A T synthesized by the monocytes was accomplished by adding tunicamycin, an inhibitor of oligosaccharide side
chain addition (27-33) (10 pg/ml, Boehringer Mannheim), or swainsonine, an inhibitor of the distal oligosaccharide processing enzyme

during the 12-h period prior to the [35S]methionine labeling and
during the pulse labeling and chase periods. Immunoprecipitation,
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-gel electrophoresis, and fluorography
were as described previously above.
Retroviral Gene Transfer of Human M-type andS-type a l A T
cDNAs to Murine Fibroblasts-Murine fibroblasts were modified to
contain the human alAT cDNAs of M-type or S-type utilizing a
retroviral vector as described previously (33). Briefly, the N2 vector
(36) was modified to contain M-type or S-type a l A T cDNAs (pN2alAT-M and pN2-alAT-S, respectively) by standard procedures.
Sequence analysis confirmed that pN2-alAT-S differed from pN2alAT-M exclusively by the single nucleotide mutation corresponding
to the S mutation. Integration of pN2-alAT-M and pN2-alAT-S
into the genome of $2 cells (37), a helper virus-free packaging cell
line, was by calcium phosphate transfection (38). Supernatants of
individual $2 clones transfected with pN2-alAT-M or pN2-alAT-S
(clones referred to as $2/alAT-M and $2/alAT-S,
respectively) were
titered for infectious retrovirus and used to generate polyclonal populations of infected NIH-3T3 cells. In the context that theretroviral
vector randomly integrates single copies of the provirus, and with the
knowledge that individual clones with the integrated a l A T cDNA
produce a1AT at different levels (39), polyclonal populations (rather
than individual cell populations) were used to ensure that the NIH-

3T3 fibroblasts with integrated M- and S-type a1AT cDNAs would
represent average populations of these cells.
Analysis of Modified Murine Fibroblasts Containing M-type and S type alAT cDNAs-Confirmation of integration of the full length
human a l A T cDNAs of M-type and S-type into
the genome of mouse
fibroblasts modified by the retroviral transfer was carried out by
Southern analysis using a 32P-labeleda l A T cDNA probe (33, 40).
Human a l A T mRNA transcripts were identified in the NIH-3T3/
alAT-M and NIH-3T3/alAT-S cells by Northern analysis (33).
Quantification of total cellular RNA for steady state human a l A T
mRNA levels was as described above for M- and S-type monocytes.
The secretion of human a l A T by NIH-3T3/alAT-M and NIH3T3/alAT-S cells was evaluated by [35S]methionine pulse-chase
labeling followed by immunoprecipitation of secreted labeled a l A T
as described previously (33). The effect of modification of oligosaccharide side chain addition and processing on secretion of human
a l A T by the cells was accomplished by incubating the cells for 6 h
with tunicamycin (10 &g/ml) or swainsonine (5 pg/ml) prior to pulse
labeling and during pulse labeling and chase periods.
Modification of Intracellular Proteolysis by Inhibition of Cellular
Proteinases-The effect of inhibition of intracellular proteinases on
the secretion of human a l A T by NIH-3TB/alAT-M and NIH-3T3/
a1AT-S cells was examined utilizing leupeptin (Boehringer Mannheim), abroad spectrum inhibitor of cellular proteinases (41-47). The
cells were plated as before with incubation in the presence of leupeptin
(0.5 mM) for 24 h prior to analysis and during pulse labeling and
chase period. The dose of leupeptin was based on previous studies in
fibroblast cell systems (46). Pulse labeling, immunoprecipitation, gel
electrophoresis, and fluorography were as described above.
RESULTS

Evaluation of the Form of S-type alAT mRNA Transcripts
in Monocytes-The A -+ T substitution of the S mutation not
only causes an amino acid change (G1uZa+ Val) but asnoted
by Schindler et al. (48),also creates a region within exon 111
of the S-type alAT gene with a high degree of homology to
the consensus 5' donor splice site, thus creating a potential
aberrant donor splice site (Fig. lA). Inthis regard, it is
conceivable that the pathogenesis of the serum deficiency of
alAT associated with the S mutation results from abnormal
d A T mRNA processing, causing a truncated form of a1AT
mRNA, andaresultantabnormal
protein. Three lines of
evidence, however, suggestthat thisputative splice donor site
is not recognized. First, Northern blot analysis of RNA of Mtype and S-typemonocytes demonstrated alAT mRNA transcripts of identical size (1.8 kb) in both cell types (Fig. 1B).
Second, evaluation of the exon I11 region of the alAT mRNA
transcripts utilizing S1protection analysis with a 1.4-kb single
strand anti-sense a l A T cDNA probe demonstrated that this
region of the alAT mRNA transcripts of S-type monocytes
was identical to that of normal "type monocytes (Fig. IC).
In contrast, if the potential aberrant 5' donor splice site in
exon I11 had been utilized, fragments of 0.9 and 0.5 kb would
have been observed (see Fig. lA).Third, comparison of the
amounts of alAT mRNA in S-type and"type alAT monocytes demonstrated equal levels of alAT transcripts ( p > 0.3)
(Fig. 2).
Secretion of alAT by S-type Monocytes-Evaluation of the
form of alAT synthesized and secreted by S-type monocytes
demonstrated a 52-kDa protein, identical to that of normal
"type monocytes (Fig. 3A). In thisregard, pulse labeling for
1 h in the presence of [35S]methioninefollowed by a 2-h chase
period revealed a 52-kDa mature form of a1AT that was
specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-a1AT antibody from
the supernatants of S-type monocytes, similar to that of the
normal "type monocytes and, as an additional control, Ztype monocytes. However, assessment of the relative amount
of newly synthesized alAT secreted by the S-type monocytes
showed that it was less than that secreted by normal "type
monocytes. Following a 1-h pulse with [35S]methionine,the

directed toward preserving the established nomenclature(22) for the coding exons (11-V) but to include the recent
observations (71) of additional noncoding exons (IA,IB) 5' to theoriginal exon I (nowIC)(22). The single nucleotide

Theoretically, thissequence could be recognized as a splice donor site. If this occurs, instead of the normal 1.8-kb
a l A T mRNA observed with "type alAT, the S-type mutation would result in a premature splice, with the
60 base pairs ( b p ) of exon I11 3' to the S mutation site lost. An
consequence of a truncated a1AT mRNA with the

DISCUSSION

I

Together, the data in the present study suggest that the
pathogenesis of reduced serum levels of alAT associated with
the a1AT S allele results from exaggerated intracellular degradation of newly synthesized alAT resulting in reduced
secretion of a1AT. This conclusion is based on several lines
of evidence, including the following. 1) Utilizing peripheral

+

S-type a1 -Antitrypsin Deficiency
the concept derived in the present study that the observed
deficient level of serum alAT seen in association with the S
homozygous state results from exaggerated intracellular degradation of the newly synthesized alAT.
One possible explanation of the apparentreduced synthesis
of alAT of S-type compared to "type monocytes is that
there is reduced expression of the a1AT gene at the level of
mRNA processing. In this regard, analysis of the sequence of
the S-type alAT gene has lead to the hypothesis that the S
mutation generates an area within the 3"terminal region of
exon I11 that has a high degree of homology to theconsensus
5' splice donor sequence (48). If recognized as a splicing site
during mRNA processing, a truncated alAT mRNA would be
generated which, if stable, would result in an altered translation reading frame and premature terminationof an abnormal
protein. Alternatively, an abnormal spliced mRNA might be
unstable, resulting in reduced levels of alAT mRNA transcripts in a1ATproducing cells. However, the demonstration
of a correctly processed alAT mRNA product of the S-type
allele as well as normal levels of steady state alAT mRNA
associated with the S homozygous state excludes the possibility that the potential aberrant splice site is recognized or, if
it is recognized, excludes its pathophysiologic relevance.
Oligosaccharide side chains serve an important function in
conferring protein stabilization during biosynthesis of many
secretory and membrane glycoproteins (53, 54). For example,
in theabsence of their normal complement of oligosaccharide
side chains, fibronectin (55), acetylcholine receptor (47), human chorionic gonadotropin receptor (56), and the lymphocyte cell surface protein CD4 (57) are all degraded within the
cell. Interestingly, the finding of secretion of near-normal
amounts of"type
alAT in the presence of blockade of
oligosaccharide addition suggests that oligosaccharide side
chains are not obligatory for the structural stabilization or
secretion of the normal form of a1AT (30-33). In marked
contrast, however, the ability of the newly synthesized S-type
alAT to remain intact and be secreted by the cell was critically dependent upon the presence of oligosaccharide side
chains. One explanation of this finding is that the S-type
protein is less stable than the "type
protein, a disparity
which is exaggerated through loss of the stabilizing effect of
oligosaccharide side chains, i.e. the S-type protein is more
dependent on the conformational stabilization afforded by the
alAT.
oligosaccharide side chains than the normal "type
Consistent with this concept, crystallographic analysis has
shown that the S mutation ( G ~ u -+
' ~Val)
~ results in the loss
of an intramolecular salt bridge with Lys3s7(50). Since this
interaction is likely critical to the tertiary structure of the
protein, it is reasonable to conclude that theS-type mutation
would have profound consequences on the conformational
stability of the alAT molecule. Inthis regard, abnormal
proteins with perturbations of tertiary conformation have
been shown to be more susceptible to intracellular proteolysis
in studies with incorporation of amino acid analogues (46,58)
and in naturally occurring mutations (59, 60). Therefore, the
demonstration of a selective increase in secretion of S-type
a l A T from synthesizing cells treated with a broad spectrum
inhibitor of cellular proteinases suggests that intracellular
proteolysis contributes to the abnormal pattern of biosynthesis of a1AT associated with the S-type allele and that this
proteolysis likely occurs because the S-type alAT molecule is
conformationally unstable. Importantly, the fact the abnormality of biosynthesis is reproduced in murine fibroblasts
modified with the S-type a1AT cDNA strongly argues that
the S-typemutationrenders
the protein intrinsically less
stable within the cell, independent of the synthesizing cell.

Multiple mechanisms of intracellular protein degradation
have been characterized (61-64). In this context, both lysosomal and non-lysosomal pathways have been implicated in
the degradation of abnormal proteins within the cell (46, 62,
65-67). The partial reversal of the S-type defect by treatment
with a broad spectrum inhibitor of cellular proteinases confirms that intracellular degradation of the protein is participatory in the aberrant biosynthesis of alAT associated with
the Glu264+ Val mutation. The proteinase inhibitor utilized
in these studies, leupeptin, has been demonstrated to inhibit
lysosomal proteinases such as thethiol proteinases cathepsin
B and cathepsinL (42,43) as well as various serine proteinases
(68). In addition, this agent hasinhibitory activity against the
calcium-dependent proteinases, calpains, which comprise a
component of the non-lysosomal pathway of intracellular
degradation (44, 45,69). It is thus not possible, based on this
limited analysis, to characterize the specific intracellular
pathways of protein degradation involved in the proteolysis
of the S-type alAT. In addition, the fact that the rescue of
the S-type alAT from proteolysis was only partial suggests
that additional degradative pathways not inhibitedby leupeptin, such as the ubiquitin pathway (67, 70), may becontributory.
