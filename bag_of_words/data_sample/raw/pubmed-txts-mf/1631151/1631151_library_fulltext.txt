ABSTRACT
Point mutations in the p53 gene have been
detected in a variety of human cancers; the mutations are
clustered in four "hot-spots" located in the coding region of
exons 5, 7, and 8, which coincide with the four most highly
conserved regions of the gene. We report the finding of a
heterozygous G-'C mutation at codon 280 (exon 8), position 2,
of the p53 gene in a nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell line,
originating from Guangdong, a province in the People's Republic of China that leads the world in NPC incidence. A survey
of nasopharyngeal tissues and NPC biopsies revealed that 1 out
of 12 NPC samples from Hunan, another province in the
People's Republic of China with high NPC incidence, had the
same heterozygous mutation at codon 280 of p53, and none of
10 biopsies from Taiwan showed a mutation within exons 5-8
of the p53 gene. No other alteration of gene structure, including
gross rearrangement or loss of heterozygosity or abnormality
of gene expression was detected in NPC cell lines or NPC
biopsies. We conclude from this study that mutational or other
ngeal
alterations of the p53 gene are not common in n
carcinogenesis and that a codon-280 mutation of p53 may be
involved in <10% of NPC cases. This result contrasts with the
relatively high frequency of p53 mutations assodated with
several other human carcinomas and suggests the importance
of other genes in NPC genesis.

in diverse human cancers both in vivo and in vitro (ref. 10 and
the references cited therein). The point mutations were found
clustered in four "hot-spots" located in exons 5, 7, and 8,
which coincide with the four most highly conserved regions
of the gene (11); the frequency of these mutations varies in
different cancers. Because p53 protein can form a complex
with several different DNA tumor virus genes, including the
simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (12), the E1B 55-kDa
protein from adenovirus type 5 (13), and human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 E6 protein (14), and because NPC is
associated with the EBV, and another EBV-associated malignancy, Burkitt lymphoma, has shown frequent p53 mutations (15, 16), the question may be raised as to the role of p53
in NPC pathogenesis. We report here a G-'C heterozygous
point mutation at codon 280 in NPC cell line(s) and in 1 out
of 12 NPC tissue sections from Hunan, China, but not in 10
NPC biopsies from Taiwan. Thus, a subset of NPC might
arise from gene cooperation involving EBV genes, one or
more specific oncogenes (9), and mutated p53.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines and Tumor S es. Four Chinese NPC cell lines,
designated CNE1, CNE2 (from Guangdong), HNE-1, and
HONE-1 (from Hunan), were originally established from the
tumors of four different patients (17-20). Although the tumors
were EBV positive, neither EBV-encoded nuclear antigens
nor EBV DNA repeated sequences were detected in the cell
lines after several passages in culture (7). The NPC cell lines
were grown-in culture, and nude mice tumors were generated
as described (7, 17-20). Human epidermal keratinocytes
(Rhek) and primary human embryonal kidney cell line (293)
were cultured as described (21, 22). During this study we
discovered through three independent measurements that all
four NPC cell lines supplied to us had arisen from a single
individual corresponding to CNE1 or CNE2.
Nasopharynx tissue was obtained from subjects biopsied at
MacKay Hospital in Taipei, for histological diagnosis of
NPC. Biopsy samples were obtained from the lesions of 10
histopathologically confirmed NPC cases, 4 adjacent normal
tissues, and 8 preneoplastic lesions (3 of chronic inflammation and 5 of lymphoid hyperplasia). All biopsy samples were
embedded in optimal-cutting-temperature compounds
(Miles) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Twelve paraffinembedded NPC tissue sections (5 ,um) were obtained from
Hunan Cancer Institute, Hunan. All tissue sections were
histopathologically confirmed as low-differentiated squamous carcinoma.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NP) occurs in many areas,
although the highest incidence is in Southern China and
Southeast Asia (1). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and
dietary and environmental factors (i.e., salted fish and medicinal herbs) have been associated with the disease (2-4). It
has been proposed that NPC initiation requires EBV expression, but induction of preneoplastic events and maintainance
of tumor-cell phenotype require critical cellular genes (5, 6).
Previously, we reported the detection of promotion sensitivity and transforming activity after introducing NPC DNA into
mouse JB6 cells (7, 8). Recently, we have isolated a transformation-associated sequence from CNE2 cells that showed
measurable transforming activity (9). According to current
theories on the origin of human cancer, both activation of
oncogenes and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes are
believed to be important in multistage human carcinogenesis.
To our knowledge, no investigations on the inactivation of
tumor-suppressor genes in NPC have been reported. We
therefore investigated the involvement of p53, a potent
tumor-suppressor gene, in NPC pathogenesis.
Alteration of the p53 gene (point mutation, deletion, or
rearrangement) and/or of its expression have been observed

RNA Isolation and Single-Stranded cDNA Synthesis. Total
RNA was extracted from two immortalized human cell lines
(Rhek and 293), cultured NPC cell lines (CNE1, CNE2,
HNE-1, and HONE-1), and nude mice tumors derived from
CNE cells by using RNAzol solution (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Single-stranded cDNAs were synthesized by avian
myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Seikaguku America, Rockville, MD) as described (23) and amplified by PCR.
Genomic DNA Isolation, PCR Amplification, and Direct
Sequencing. Genomic DNA from CNE cells and nude mice
tumors derived from them was isolated through CsCl purification (9). The isolation of genomic DNA from biopsies and
NPC paraffin section and the subsequent PCR amplificationdirect sequencing is detailed elsewhere (24). Briefly, ground
biopsies or paraffin-embedded NPC tissue sections were
digested in lysis buffer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA) followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol
precipitation of DNA. Five hundred nanograms to 2 ,ug of
genomic DNA (-50 ng for NPC tissue section) was used for
each standard PCR amplification. A sample of amplified
fragment was analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% NuSieve
(FMC)/1% agarose gels, and the remaining product was
purified with Centricon 100 (Amicon) and subjected to singlestranded DNA amplification by using only the excess primer.
Amplified single-stranded DNA was purified with Centricon
30 and subjected directly to dideoxynucleotide chaintermination sequencing (24).
Primers. Primers P1 and P2 (11) were used for PCR
amplification of the entire coding region of p53. The remaining primers were designed based on the published sequence
of p53 (25, 26) and synthesized by Operon Technologies
(Alameda, CA). These primers are listed in Table 1.

RESULTS
Normal Expression of p53 mRNA in NPC Cells. To examine
whether p53 mRNA was expressed at normal size in NPC cell
line(s) CNE1 and CNE2, we analyzed with reverse transcriptase-PCR using two primers (P1 and P2) flanking the entire
p53 coding region (11). Fig. 1 shows that these cell lines
generated fragments of 1.3 kilobases (kb), the size expected
for the wild-type open reading frame (11) (lanes 2 and 3).
When two pairs of primers flanking mutation hot-spot regions
A and B (SHSO1/SHS02) and regions C and D (SHS03/
SHS04), respectively, were used, fragments showing the
expected sizes of 250 and 272 base pairs (bp) according to
wild-type sequence (25), were detected (lanes 4 and 5; 6 and
7). Fig. 2 shows the four mutation hot-spot regions as well as
the locations and directions of each primer. Northern (RNA)
analysis revealed a 2.5-kb transcript in CNE cells with

Gross Structural Alteration of the p53 Gene in NPC Cell Lines

the DNA level, we examined possible gross deletion or
rearrangement of the p53 gene by Southern analysis. Genomic DNA (15 ug for cell lines and 10 ,ug for biopsies) was
digested to completion with Bgl II on CNE cell lines and nude
mice tumors derived from them, biopsies of eight NPCs,
three lymphoid hyperplasias, three chronic inflammations,
and three adjacent normal tissues. In all samples, two polymorphic bands of9 kb and/or 12 kb (26) were detected as well
as three restriction fragments of 43 kb, 16 kb, and 2.8 kb. No
gross deletion or rearrangement was found (data not shown).
Due to the limited amounts of DNA isolated from the small
NPC biopsies, we could perform Southern analysis on only
the six largest samples. When these samples [three from NPC
biopsies, two from CNE cell line(s), and one from normal

human placenta] were digested with EcoRI, BamHI, or
HindIII, all samples showed the same genomic p53 hybridizing fragments as the normal control (data not shown). Thus,
no gross deletion or rearrangement of the p53 gene could be
detected in NPC cell line(s) or in NPC biopsies.
LOH in the p53 gene has been reported for various tumors
(27). We examined whether loss of heterozygosity in the p53
gene occurred in NPC biopsies by analysis of codon 72 and
Bgi II polymorphisms. Codon 72 (Arg/Pro) polymorphism of
the p53 gene can be detected by PCR amplification of
genomic DNA with primers GD09/GD10, yielding a 310-bp
fragment, followed by BstUI (New England Biolabs) digestion. BstUI cleaves the CGC (Arg) allele, yielding two
fragments of 175 bp and 135 bp but does not cleave the CCC
(Pro) allele. Fig. 3 shows that DNAs of two NPC biopsies
showed heterozygosity at codon 72; the remaining samples
showed homozygosity with either CGC or CCC. However,
when the DNA of lymphocytes from all eight corresponding
NPC patients was analyzed, the digestion pattern was identical (data not shown). These results were further confirmed
by PCR-direct sequencing of the 310-bp fragment. The absence of LOH in NPC biopsy 2 (Fig. 3, lane 2) was verified
by Bgi II polymorphism when compared with adjacent normal tissue from the same patient (data not shown). These
results indicated no LOH of the p53 gene in two informative
NPC biopsies. Thus, alteration of p53 genomic structure is
not seen in NPC cell line(s) or NPC biopsies.

at codon

280, position 2 (within hot-

spot region D, exon 8) was detected in the CNE cell lines (Fig.

4 Lower Left). Indeed, this is the only mutation detected in
CNE2 cells after sequencing the entire 1.3-kb coding region of
p53. When region D ofcDNA from two normal control human
immortalized cell lines, Rhek and 293, was sequenced, only
wild type (AGA) was detected (Fig. 4 Upper). The observed
mutation causes a base substitution of the basic amino acid
arginine by the neutral amino acid threonine and also a
predicted loss of Bsa I or BsmAI sites, a prediction confirmed
by PCR amplification of exon 8 followed by Bsa I digestion
(data not shown). The detection of wild-type sequence at
codon 280 indicated that one allele was mutated, the other
allele was retained as normal, and both alleles were expressed.
If the mutation were important for tumorigenesis, it should
be selected for in nude mice tumors derived from these NPC
cell line(s). We sequenced these same regions in the nude
mice tumors derived from CNE1 and CNE2 and found the
same

280. The wild-type sequence was also detected (Fig. 4 Lower
Right). Throughout this study, both strands were sequenced.
In each case, the mutation detected was confirmed by a
repeat experiment in which a second sample of cDNA was
used as a PCR template and, again, both strands were
sequenced. Although differences in morphology, in karyotype, and in degree of tumorigenicity were seen, we discovered [by isozyme phenotypic profile, c-Ha-ras/BamHI polymorphism and microsatellite (A31-69)/Hinfl polymorphism
(28)] that all four NPC cell lines had arisen from the same
individual, corresponding to CNE1 or CNE2. Thus, we conclude that one out of one NPC cell line from Guangdong
showed the codon-280 mutation.
The finding of the codon-280 mutation in NPC cell line(s)
stimulated us to ask whether the same mutation was also
present in NPC tumor biopsies and whether it might be
involved in nasopharyngeal tumorigenesis. We, therefore,
sequenced all of exons 5, 7, and 8 of 22 nasopharynx biopsies
from Taiwan (10 histopathologically confirmed NPCs, 4
samples of paired adjacent normal tissues, 8 samples of
nasopharyngeal lesions) and found no mutation in any samples. In addition, we sequenced exons 4 and 6 in the 10 NPC
biopsies, and again no point mutation was revealed. Due to
limited amounts of NPC tissue section available from Hunan,
only exon 8, which contains codon 280, was sequenced. Fig.
G -+ C heterozygous point mutation at
5 shows that the
codon 280 was detected in 1 out of 12 Hunan NPC tissues
(Left). For comparison with a negative sample, another NPC
biopsy from Hunan, having wild-type sequence, was also
included (Fig. 5 Right). We considered three potential
sources of error: (i) Contamination from NPC cell line DNA
or RNA could have occurred. This possibility can be excluded because neither NPC cells nor cell line nucleic acids
were handled during the period in which the Hunan biopsies
were analyzed. Furthermore codon-280 mutation was seen in
1 out of 12 biopsies, not 12 out of 12, which would be expected
were PCR primers or buffers contaminated. (ii) Normal tissue
might contaminate biopsies. Because biopsies contain contaminating normal tissue that would dilute a mutant p53 if
same

present, we conducted a mixing experiment to determine the

sensitivity of our assay for the point mutation. When 90%o
codon-280-negative biopsy DNA from Taiwan was mixed with
10%o codon-280-positive DNA from CNE2 for PCR-direct
sequencing, we reproducibly detected the codon-280 mutation. Thus, we conclude that any biopsy consisting of as little
as 10%o of mutant p53-containing epithelial cells from the NPC
would have been detected. (iii) The apparent codon-280 mutation seen in an NPC cell line from Guangdong and in an NPC
biopsy from Hunan could represent polymorphism rather than
a mutation. This possibility was rendered unlikely by observed
loss of growth-suppressor function of p53-Thr2m when overexpressed in recipient cells (data not shown) and by the failure
to detect codon p53-Thrm in any of 14 non-NPC samples
measured by us and in any of -50 normal tissues measured by
others. Taken together, the above observations indicate that

genesis that occurs in <10o of NPC tumors. To ascertain
whether the 8% (1/12) frequency in NPCs from Hunan and the
0%o (0/10) frequency in NPCs from Taiwan differ significantly
by statistical analysis would require more samples.

DISCUSSION
We report here the detection of a heterozygous G C point
mutation at codon 280 of the p53 gene in an NPC cell line that
originated from Guangdong province in southern China. This
mutation is the only one detected within the entire 1.3-kb
coding region of the p53 gene in the NPC cell line CNE2. It is
also the only mutation within exon 8 in one of 12 NPC tissues
from Hunan. Although p53 gene mutations have been found in
diverse human cancers (10, 11), a mutation at codon 280 has
been reported in only one breast cancer cell line with a
nonidentical site of mutation (29). Osborne et al. (30) recently
-*

reported

an

identical G -) C homozygous

point mutation

at

codon 280 in a primary breast tumor. This tumor also bore a
second mutation at codon 285 (30). Recently we have learned
(personal communication) that C. Spruck, Y. Tsai, D. Huang,
A. Yang, W. Rideout, and P. Jones have independently
measured codon 280 mutation of p53 in CNE1 and CNE2 cells
obtained from Guangzhou, China.
The observation of two p53 alleles with one allele mutated
has been reported for a variety of human cancers including
carcinomas of the colon (11), lung (31), esophagus (32), liver
(33, 34), and ovary (35) as well as in leukemias (23), even
when the sample was composed of 100% cancer cells (35).
The mutant p53 gene product has been postulated to override
wild-type function by a dominant negative mechanism (36),
as indicated by direct inactivation of the wild-type protein by
mutant p53 protein through oligomer formation (37, 38), or by
conformational adoption of the mutant form (39). In other
studies, however, when both wild-type and mutant p53
cDNA constructs were cotransfected into cells, the wild-type
form appeared dominant (40, 41). Recent findings in our
laboratory (Y.S., K. Nakamura, E. Wendel, unpublished
work) show that overexpression of p53 Thr280 in mouse JB6
cells harboring endogenous wild-type p53 causes progression
to tumor cell phenotype, suggesting mutant dominance for
progression.

The G -- C point mutation at codon 280 causes an amino
acid substitution of arginine by threonine. Because p53 is
phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues (42, 43), the
Arg -* Thr substitution may increase the possibility for
phosphorylation of the p53 protein. It has been speculated
that, like in retinoblastoma, phosphorylation of p53 causes the
loss of its tumor-suppressor function (44). Computer secondary-structure prediction of p53 protein shows that the surface
probability of codon 280 is very high according to the Emini
method (45), implying easy access to molecular interaction,
and that the Arg -- Thr substitution causes the loss of a turn
in the protein secondary structure according to the GarnierOsguthorpe-Robson method (46) (data not shown), implying a
conformational change. Thus, this mutation appears to be in a
conformationally significant domain.
We did not detect any point mutations in the 10 NPC
biopsies from Taiwan when exons 4-8 of the p53 gene were
sequenced, although we cannot rule out mutations in other
regions. The possibility for gross gene rearrangement in NPC
biopsies as well as cell line(s) was excluded by multiple
restriction enzyme digestion followed by Southern analysis.
Overexpression or alternative splicing of the genes was also
excluded by reverse transcriptase-PCR/Northern analysis in
CNE cell line(s). Although the number of informative NPC
biopsies was limited, we found no LOH. Overall, we conclude that p53 gene alteration occurs with a low frequency in
nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis, with <10% of cases showing
the codon-280 mutation. This result distinguishes NPC from
such carcinomas as breast, colon, lung, and esophagus
(which show a high p53 mutation frequency), putting them in
a class with thyroid carcinoma (which shows a low p53
mutation frequency) (47). Whether the high-frequency and
low-frequency classes of carcinomas can be distinguished on
the basis of dietary or environmental exposure remains to be
established. Because p53 mutation is not common, the question is raised whether other genes, such as EBV genes and the
recently reported NPC-transforming sequence (9), are important in the genesis of NPC.
The genesis of the G -- C transversion in p53 probably does
not involve spontaneous mutation, such as deamination of
5-methylcytosine (48). It seems likely that this particular
codon-280 mutation of the p53 gene was induced through
exposure to environmental carcinogens, such as nitrosamines (4) present in the diet or cigarette smoke but was not
induced by aflatoxins that would be expected to produce G
-* T transversion in codon 249 (33, 34). Further understanding ofthe possible functional significance of this p53-Thr8 in
carcinogenesis awaits evidence of its oncogenic activity in a
human model or its activity in antagonizing wild-type p53
tumor-suppressor function.
