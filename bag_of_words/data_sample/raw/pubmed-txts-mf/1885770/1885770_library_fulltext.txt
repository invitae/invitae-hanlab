Abstract
Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease both result from the
deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, acid sphingomyelinase (E.C. 3.1.4.12). Type A Niemann-Pick disease is a severe neurodegenerative disorder of infancy which leads to death
by three years of age, whereas Type B disease has a later age at
onset, little or no neurologic involvement, and most patients
survive into adulthood. To investigate the molecular basis for
the remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity, the nature of the mutations causing Type B Niemann-Pick disease in Ashkenazi
Jewish patients was determined. The entire acid sphingomyelinase coding region from an Ashkenazi Jewish Type B patient
was polymerase chain reaction-amplified, subcloned, and completely sequenced. A three-base deletion was identified of nucleotides 1821-1823 in the cDNA which predicted the removal
of an arginine residue from position 608 of the acid sphingomyelinase polypeptide (AR608). The other cDNA clones from
this patient had the R496L mutation previously identified in
Type A Niemann-Pick disease patients. Both Ashkenazi Jewish Type B patients were heteroallelic for the AR608 mutation,
whereas this allele was not present in 15 unrelated non-Jewish
Type B patients, with the notable exception of one mildly affected patient of Arabic descent who was homoallelic for the
AR608 mutation. These results indicate that the AR608 mutation predicts the Type B Niemann-Pick disease phenotype,
even in the presence of the R496L Type A allele, thereby providing the first genotype/phenotype correlation for this lysosomal storage disease. Although only two patients have been
studied, it appears that the AR608 mutation occurs frequently
in Type B Niemann-Pick disease patients of Ashkenazi Jewish
descent. (J. Clin. Invest. 1991. 88:806-810.) Key words: lysosomal storage disease * heteroallelism- genotype/phenotype

Introduction
Niemann-Pick disease, an inborn error of sphingomyelin catabolism, results from the deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, acid sphingomyelinase (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase; E.C.3.1.4.12) (1, 2). Two allelic forms of this autosomal
recessive disorder have been delineated based on their distinct

phenotypes (2-6). Type A Niemann-Pick disease is a severe
neurodegenerative disorder ofinfancy characterized by progressive psychomotor retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, and death
by three years of age. In contrast, Type B Niemann-Pick disease is a nonneuronopathic disorder characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, respiratory involvement, and survival into adulthood. In addition, a third form of Niemann-Pick disease, Type
C, has been described (5). However, since most of the patients
with Type C Niemann-Pick disease have a defect in cholesterol
esterification, it is unlikely that this form of the disease results
from primary lesions in the acid sphingomyelinase gene. The
clinical course of patients with Type A disease is quite uniform,
whereas the severity among Type B patients is more variable.
In fact, some mildly affected Type B patients may survive into
the sixth decade of life (5). Both types occur more frequently
among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (- 1/40,000)
than in the general population (7); however, mass screening for
carrier detection in this population has been precluded due to
the marked overlap of acid sphingomyelinase activities in leukocytes from obligate heterozygotes and normal individuals.
To date, biochemical investigations into the genetic heterogeneity underlying the neuronopathic Type A and nonneuronopathic Type B phenotypes have been limited since acid sphingomyelinase is difficult to purify, the commonly used enzymatic assays are insensitive and labor intensive, and
monospecific antibodies have been difficult to produce (8-10).
In general, Type A Niemann-Pick disease patients tend to have
slightly lower residual activities in crude cell and tissue homogenates than Type B patients; however, the residual activities
have not been well characterized (2, 5, 11, 12). Similarly, all of
the Type A and B Niemann-Pick disease patients studied to
date have had cross-reactive immunologic material in crude
cell homogenates; however, accurate estimates of the amount
of enzyme protein have not been determined (13, 14).
In contrast, investigations into the molecular nature of the
genetic heterogeneity in Niemann-Pick disease have been facilitated by the recent isolation and characterization of the fulllength cDNA encoding human acid sphingomyelinase (15, 16).
The 2347-bp cDNA contained an open reading frame of 1890bp which encoded a 629-residue polypeptide containing six
potential N-glycosylation sites. The availability of the cDNA
permitted the localization of the acid sphingomyelinase gene to
the chromosomal region 1 lpl 5.1-15.4 by the use of somatic
cell hybrids and in situ hybridization techniques (17). Studies
also have been undertaken to determine the nature of the genetic lesions causing Type A Niemann-Pick disease. By sequencing polymerase chain reaction (PCR)'-amplified acid

sphingomyelinase cDNAs from a Type A patient of Ashkenazi
Jewish descent, a single, exonic G to T transversion was identified which predicted an arginine to leucine substitution in position 496 of the acid sphingomyelinase polypeptide (designated
R496L) (18). The R496L mutation was found in about onethird of the Ashkenazi Jewish Type A Niemann-Pick disease
alleles studied; in contrast, only about 6.0% of the alleles from
non-Jewish Type A patients had this mutation. Some Type A
patients were homoallelic for the R496L mutation, while
others were heteroallelic, indicating the occurrence of other
acid sphingomyelinase mutations that caused the Type A phenotype. Interestingly, the R496L mutation also was detected in
one of the two Ashkenazi Jewish Type B patients studied.
Thus, efforts were undertaken to determine the molecular lesion in the other acid sphingomyelinase allele ofthe Ashkenazi
Jewish Type B patient who was heteroallelic for the R496L
mutation.
In this communication, we report the identification of a
three-base deletion in the acid sphingomyelinase coding region
from this Type B Niemann-Pick disease patient (proband 2)
that results in the deletion of codon 608, which encoded an
arginine residue (designated AR608). Notably, both of the
unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish Type B patients analyzed were heteroallelic for the AR608 mutation and one of the 15 unrelated
non-Jewish Type B patients studied was homoallelic. The absence of the AR608 mutation in 67 Type A Niemann-Pick
disease alleles suggested that the AR608 lesion resulted in the
Type B phenotype, even when heteroallelic with the R496L
Type A mutation, thus providing the first genotype/phenotype
correlation for Niemann-Pick disease.

Methods
Cell lines. Primary cultures of fibroblasts and lymphoblasts were established from skin biopsies and peripheral blood samples obtained with
informed consent from Niemann-Pick disease patients and family
members, and from normal individuals. Niemann-Pick disease lines
GMOO1 12A, GM00165, GM00370, GM00406, GM00559, GM02895,
and GM03252 were obtained from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell
Repository, Camden, NJ. Cell lines 444X.FO1, 534R.F03, 556X.FO1,
888V.F01, 2789X.FO1, 4293Q.E02, 4774Z.F01, 5113C.L01, 5115E.F01, and 679 1M.FO1 were obtained from the Service de Biochimie,
Hospice de Lyon, Lyon, France. Cell lines DMN 83.126, DMN 84.135,
DMN 84.87, DMN 86.49, DMN 87.71, DMN 87.99, DMN 88.12,
DMN 88.9, and RNS were provided by Dr. Peter Penchev, Developmental and Metabolic Neurology Branch, National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke. The cells were
grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 1% penicillin, and 1 mg/ml streptomycin by standard procedures (18). The diagnosis of Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease was
based on clinical criteria (e.g., age at onset, presence of neurologic involvement, etc.) and by demonstration of markedly deficient acid
sphingomyelinase activity in cultured cells (8). Clinical data on probands 1 and 2 have been published (3, 19), and information on proband 3 was provided by Dr. M. Vanier, Department of Biochemistry,
Faculte de Medecine, Lyon, France.
Enzyme and protein assays. Acid sphingomyelinase activity was
determined in cultured fibroblasts obtained from Niemann-Pick disease patients and normal individuals using the fluorescent natural substrate, [N- 12(l -pyrenesulfonyl)amido dodecanoyl] sphingomyelin
(PSA12-sphingomyelin) as previously described (8). 1 U of activity
equals that amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 nmol of substrate per
h. Protein determinations were performed by a modified fluorescamine assay (20).

cDNA and genomic amplification and sequencing. For acid sphingomyelinase cDNA amplification and sequencing, total RNA was isolated from cultured cells by standard procedures (21). First-strand
cDNA was synthesized with reverse transcriptase from - 5 Ag of total
RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim Corp., Indianapolis, IN). The acid
sphingomyelinase cDNA (- 10%l6 of the total reaction) was PCR-amplified (22) with Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT)
using the previously described oligonucleotide primers (18). PCR was
performed for 30 cycles, each consisting of denaturation for 1 min at
940C and annealing and extension for 4 min at 720C. After amplification, the PCR products were isolated from agarose gels and subcloned
into either Bluescript KS (+) (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) or pGEM
9Zf (-) (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) vectors. For each amplified
product, from 4 to 10 independent subclones were sequenced in both
orientations by the dideoxy method (23).
To confirm the candidate mutation, genomic DNA was isolated
from the proband (21) and a 567-bp genomic fragment containing
the mutation was PCR-amplified using sense (5'-AGTAGTCGACATGGGCAGGATGTGTGG-3') and antisense (Y-AGTAGTGTCGACTTGCCTGGTTGAACCACAGC-3') primers synthesized on a
DNA Synthesizer (model 380B; Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City,
CA) (24). The amplified genomic fragment was isolated, subcloned,
and sequenced as described above for the PCR-amplified acid sphingomyelinase cDNAs.
Dot-blot analysis ofthe mutant alleles. For detection of the AR608
mutation in other Niemann-Pick disease patients, their parents and
relatives, as well as normal individuals, total genomic DNA was isolated, PCR-amplified as described above, and the 567-bp acid sphingomyelinase product was analyzed by dot-blot hybridization using Zetabind nylon membranes (AMF-Cuno, Meriden, CT) and a dot-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). Hybridizations ofthe
PCR product with the normal allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO)
(5'-CTCTGTGCCGCCACCTG-3') or with the AR608 ASO (5'GCTCTGTGCCACCTGAT-3') were performed for at least 3 h at
39°C. 5' end-labeling of the ASOs with T4 polynucleotide kinase and
[y-32P]ATP (> 5,000 Ci/mmol) was performed by standard procedures
(21). After hybridization, the blots were washed at room temperature
for 15 min in 6X SSC containing 0.1% SDS, and then for 2 h in the
same solution at either 54°C for the normal ASO or 50°C for the
AR608 ASO. Dot-blot analysis of the R496L mutation was performed
as previously described (19).

Results
Identification of the AR608 mutation in an Ashkenazi Jewish
patient with Type B Niemann-Pick disease. Previous studies of
an Ashkenazi Jewish Type B Niemann-Pick disease patient
(proband 2; cell line MS 1271) indicated that he had - 5-8%
residual acid sphingomyelinase activity and that he was heteroallelic for the R496L mutation (19). To identify the molecular
lesion in his other acid sphingomyelinase allele, total RNA
from the proband was reverse-transcribed, the acid sphingomyelinase coding region was PCR-amplified, and the PCR
products were subcloned into plasmid vectors for DNA sequencing. A three-base deletion (CCG) of nucleotides 18211823 in the full-length acid sphingomyelinase cDNA (16) was
identified which predicted the removal of a single arginine residue at position 608 of the acid sphingomyelinase polypeptide
(designated AR608). The authenticity of this deletion was determined by genomic sequencing (Fig. 1) and by dot-blot hybridization of PCR-amplified genomic DNA from proband 2
and other family members using an ASO specific for the
AR608 mutation (Fig. 2). In addition, dot-blot hybridizations
confirmed the AR608/R496L genotype of proband 2, and demGenetic Heterogeneity in Types A and B Niemann-Pick Disease

onstrated that the AR608 and R496L mutations were transmitted from his father and mother, respectively. Proband 2's
brother did not receive either mutant acid sphingomyelinase
allele. The AR608 mutation was not identified in over 100 acid
sphingomyelinase alleles from normal individuals, indicating
that the deletion was not a polymorphism.
Occurrence of the AR608 mutation in types A and B Niemann-Pick disease. Table I shows the occurrence ofthe AR608
mutation in the acid sphingomyelinase alleles of other patients
and obligate heterozygotes with Types A and B Niemann-Pick
disease, as determined by dot-blot analysis of PCR-amplified
genomic DNA. Interestingly, a second, unrelated Ashkenazi
Jewish Type B Niemann-Pick disease patient was heteroallelic
for the AR608 mutation and another, unknown mutant acid
sphingomyelinase allele. Of the 15 non-Jewish Type B patients
studied only one, an Arab from Algeria (proband 3; cell line
534R.F03), was homoallelic for this mutation. This 2 1-yr old
male has a mild Type B phenotype (Vanier, M. T., personal
communication). Of the 67 acid sphingomyelinase alleles from
Type A Niemann-Pick disease patients or obligate heterozygotes (26 and 19 unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish and non-Jewish
individuals, respectively), none had the AR608 mutation.

Comparison of the residual acid sphingomyelinase activities in Type A and B Niemann-Pick disease patients. Table II
shows the acid sphingomyelinase activities in cultured fibroblasts from probands 1, 2, and 3, which were determined using
the fluorescent natural substrate, PSA12-sphingomyelin. Normal individuals had a mean activity of46.3 nmol cleaved/h per
mg. In contrast, Type A proband 1, who was homoallelic for
R496L, had < 1% of normal activity. Type B proband 2, whose
genotype was R496L/AR608, had a residual activity of 5%
of normal, whereas proband 3 who was homoallelic for AR608
had - 13% of normal mean acid sphingomyelinase activity,
indicating that the AR608 allele expressed functional acid
sphingomyelinase activity in a dosage-dependent manner.

Discussion
In 1966, Brady et al. reported that the primary enzymatic defect in Type A Niemann-Pick disease was the deficient activity
of acid sphingomyelinase (1). In the following year, Schneider
and Kennedy demonstrated that acid sphingomyelinase activity also was markedly decreased in patients with the milder,
visceral form of Niemann-Pick disease now known as Type B
disease (2). Subsequent biochemical analyses of additional patients confirmed these findings (10-12) and somatic cell genetic studies demonstrated that the mutations causing Types A
and B disease were allelic (6). These findings stimulated investigators to speculate that the remarkable clinical heterogeneity
observed among Type A and B Niemann-Pick disease patients

was due to different mutations in the acid sphingomyelinase
gene which resulted in altered enzyme polypeptides that expressed varying amounts of residual activity (e.g., 13, 14). However, efforts to reliably predict either the disease subtype or the
severity of Type B patients by the amount of residual acid
sphingomyelinase activity have not been possible, in part due
to the inability of assay procedures to accurately distinguish
between patients with low levels of residual acid sphingomyelinase activity and/or the presence of the neutral sphingomyelinase activity in cell homogenates (25). In addition, the inability to reliably discriminate obligate heterozygotes for Types A
and B Niemann-Pick disease from noncarriers by the determination of acid sphingomyelinase activity in isolated leukocytes
has precluded carrier screening for Niemann-Pick disease.
The recent cloning and sequencing of the acid sphingomyelinase cDNA (15, 16) has permitted identification of the first
mutations which result in Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease. Previously, the R496L mutation, due to a single G to T
transversion, was found in 32% of the Ashkenazi Jewish Type
A Niemann-Pick disease alleles studied. In contrast, it was present in only 5.6% of the non-Jewish Type A alleles analyzed
(19). In addition, proband 2, an Ashkenazi Jewish Type B Niemann-Pick disease patient was found to be heteroallelic for the
R496L mutation. In our study, a three-base deletion (AR608)
in the acid sphingomyelinase gene was identified as the other
mutation in proband 2. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the three-base
deletion, CCG, removed the last nucleotide of codon Cys-607
(TGC) and the first two nucleotides of codon Arg-608 (CGC).
The new codon 607 formed by this deletion, TGC, also encoded a cysteine residue. Thus, the deletion resulted in the
elimination of a single codon, 608, which encoded an arginine

residue.
Detection of the R496L and AR608 mutations in patients
with Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease has permitted genotype/phenotype correlations and provided insights into the
function of the altered enzymes encoded by these mutant alleles (Table II). The homoallelic (R496L/R496L) Type A patient who expresses < 1 % of normal acid sphingomyelinase activity in cultured fibroblasts indicates that the R496L mutation
encodes an acid sphingomyelinase polypeptide with little, if
any, catalytic activity and/or markedly decreased stability,
thereby resulting in the neuronopathic phenotype. In contrast,
both heteroallelic (R496L/AR608) and homoallelic (AR608/
AR608) Type B patients express an enzyme with sufficient residual activity to prevent neurologic manifestations. These findings suggest that the substitution of an arginine for a leucine at
position 496 was more damaging to the enzyme's activity and/
or stability than the deletion of an arginine residue in position
608. It follows that Type B patients who are homoallelic for
AR608 would have a milder disease course than Type B patients who are heteroallelic for AR608 and a Type A mutation.
Notably, proband 3 had comparatively milder disease manifestations than proband 2 at the same age. Thus, these genotype/
phenotype correlations indicate that the more residual acid
sphingomyelinase activity expressed by the mutant alleles, the
milder the disease manifestations. Ideally, in vitro expression
would permit comparisons of the activity and stability of the
residual enzymes expressed by each mutant acid sphingomyelinase allele. However, it is likely that the residual activities
expressed by the mutant alleles would be too low to permit
biochemical characterization, particularly since eukaryotic ex-

pression systems (e.g., COS-l cells, CHO cells) have endogenous acid sphingomyelinase activity and prokaryotic systems
do not perform the posttranslational modifications (e.g., N-glycosylation) required for acid sphingomyelinase activity.
The occurrence of genetic heterogeneity resulting in dramatically different phenotypes is a hallmark of the lysosomal
storage diseases. A notable example in which the molecular
lesions have been correlated with distinct phenotypes is TaySachs disease (26, 27). Mutations causing the classic, infantile
form of Tay-Sachs disease have included deletions, insertions,
and splice site mutations in the fl-hexosaminidase A a-chain
gene that resulted in no detectable transcripts, whereas an exonic point mutation expresses sufficient enzymatic activity to
result in the adult or chronic type of GM2 gangliosidosis. Analo-

gously, identification of the R496L and AR608 mutations has
provided the first insights into the molecular lesions in the acid
sphingomyelinase gene underlying the remarkable phenotypic
heterogeneity in Niemann-Pick disease. Clearly, individuals
who are homoallelic for the R496L mutation will have a severe
neuronopathic phenotype and Type A Niemann-Pick disease.
The phenotype of patients heteroallelic for R496L will depend
on the genetic lesion present on their other acid sphingomyelinase allele. In contrast, patients who are either homo- or heteroallelic for the AR608 (e.g., probands 2 and 3) will most
likely have Type B Niemann-Pick disease. The identification of
additional mutations causing Types A and B Niemann-Pick
disease should permit reliable genotype/phenotype correlations and provide further insights into the functional organization of the acid sphingomyelinase polypeptide.
