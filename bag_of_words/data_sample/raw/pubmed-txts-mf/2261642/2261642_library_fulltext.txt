Muscle dystrophin
mRNAs from Duchenne (DMD) and
Becker (BMD) patients with internal deletion of the
DMD gene were quantitated
and sequenced.
In all
cases (eight DMD and three BMD), truncated mature
transcripts
were found, and their amount was correlated to the clinical phenotype
and to the reading
frame. We focused on four cases that were apparently
not in agreement
with the reading frame rule. In two
DMD casds, slightly
reduced amounts of in-frame
truncated
mRNA are present but no dystrophin
is
detected, suggesting
impaired translation
and/or instability of the protein. In two BYD patients with outof-frame deletions,
the presence of minor in-frame
alternatively
spliced mRNA species Is congruent with
the observed truncated dystrophin
and the mild phenotype.
Introduction
Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD and
BMD) are produced by allelic defects of the huge (>2000
kb) dystrophin gene (reviewed by Monaco and Kunkel,
1988; Worton and Thompson, 1988). The final product, a
427 kd protein mainly localized in muscle sarcolemma, is
encoded by a 14 kb mRNA. In about 60% of the cases,
the gene defect is a deletion of variable extent and location, resulting either in the severe DMD type of disease or
in the milder BMD type. Hoffman et al. (1988) showed that

the clinical phenotype correlates with the status of muscle
dystrophin, absent or drastically reduced (<3%) in DMD
patients, while present but reduced in amount (>lO%)
and/or size in BMD patients. Concomitantly, it was observed that the severe DMD phenotype is produced by deletions causing a disruption of the reading frame in the
gene, precluding any production of functional dystrophin;
conversely, the milder BMD phenotype is produced by deletions that do not alter the reading frame, resulting in the
production of a truncated dystrophin (Monaco et al., 1988;
Koenig et al., 1989).
However, exceptions to the reading frame theory, i.e,
DMD with in-frame deletions and BMD with out-of-frame
deletions (Malhotra et al., 1988; Gilgenkrantz et al., 1989),
are found in about 8% of the deletions (Koenig et al.,
1989). In previous studies, sensitive methods, such as in
situ RNA hybridization
(Oronzi-Scott et al., 1988) and
mRNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Chelly et al.,
1988; Muntoni and Strong, 1989), showed the presence of
dystrophin transcript even in cases with internal gene deletions. In these studies, however, the amount and the sequence of resulting truncated dystrophin transcripts have
not been investigated. Such analysis should help to check
the actual reading frame and to understand the molecular
basis of the cases that are in apparent contradiction with
Monaco’s rule.
In this study, PCR-amplified dystrophin transcripts are
investigated in muscle specimens from eight DMD and
three BMD patients with known internal deletions of the
DMD gene, with special emphasis on four cases (two
DMD and two BMD) that are apparently not in agreement
with the reading frame rule. Using appropriate combinations of primers amplifying across the predicted junction
point, we looked for alternative splicing patterns that might
explain these exceptions. The results are correlated with
the clinical phenotype, the reading frame deduced from
the gene deletion, and the dystrophin status.
Results
Detection and Quantitation
of Mature Transcripts
of the Dystrophin Gene in Muscle from DMD
and BMD Patients
We screened by PCR coamplification
three different portions of the dystrophin mRNA (see Figure la) from muscle
biopsy specimens: a 201 nucleotide segment in the 5’ region spanning nucleotides 1015-1216 on the cDNA sequence, as established by Koenig et al. (1988); a 170
nucleotide segment in the middle part of the transcript
(6365-6535);
and a 125 nucleotide segment in the 3’ region (9362-9487).
The relative amount of dystrophin
mRNA in each sample was determined as already described (Chelly et al., 1990). In this procedure a known
amount of exogenous mRNA (rat L-pyruvate kinase [L-PK]),
used as a standard, is added and coamplified along with
the dystrophin mRNA segments.

detected internal gene deletions (eight DMD and three
BMD), the three dystrophin mRNA segments were found,
except when one of the primers was in the deleted region
(Table 1 and Figure 1). in addition, in two DMD cases without any detected gene deletion, the three segments could
be amplified, indicating that the gene was not deleted in
the corresponding
region (patients 4 and 9; Table 1 and
Figure 1). Quantitative analysis in 13 muscle samples, performed (after 15 PCR cycles) in the exponential phase of
the amplification (prerequisite to do relative quantitation;
Chelly et al., 1990) showed that the dystrophin transcript
was diminished in the majority of cases, the decrease being approximately equivalent for the three segments in
each sample (Figure lb).
The amount of residual mRNA varied greatly, and two
categories could be defined: one with less than 10% dystrophin mRNA (eight DMD) (see, for example, Figures lb
and 2a, 15 cycles), the other with more than 25% dystrophin mRNA (two DMD and three BMD) (see Figures lb
and 5a). in the first group, all cases are DMD, six of which
with a known deletion that apparently disrupts the reading
frame, and two in which DNA had not been investigated.
In the second group, with significantly higher levels of dystrophin mRNA, there are two DMD cases with a known de-

Analysis of Dystrophin lkanscripts
in Cases
in Which the Phenotype (DMD or BMD) is
in Agreement
with the Reading
Frame Hypothesis
To investigate the truncated dystrophin mRNA, we used
primers flanking the deleted exons to amplify the transcript of muscle samples from two DMD and one BMD patient. In Figure 2, we show typical results obtained in a
DMD case with an internal out-of-frame deletion removing
exon 50 (patient 13; Table 1 and Figure 2). Using primers
in exons 49 and 52, we amplified, as expected, a fragment
of about 350 bp, which hybridized to the internal oligoprobes E52c2 and E49i2. Figure 2a shows that, after 15
cycles, the level of truncated dystrophin transcripts is very
reduced (<IO%); in contrast, after 30 cycles, the signal is
equivalent in the DMD and the control muscle because
the amplification has ceased to be exponential and the
PCR products have reached a plateau (Chelly et al., 1990).
As expected, this abnormal fragment was cut by Rsal
and Ddel (data not shown). Three independent
clones
were sequenced, giving the expected out-of-frame sequence and showing that exons 49 and 51 were precisely
abutted with a stop codon 30 nucleotides after the junction point (Figure 2~). In normal muscle, in addition to the
normally spliced transcript (450 bp), we observed, after 30
cycles only, an additional 120 bp species, corresponding
to an in-frame alternative splicing directly abutting exons
49 and 52 (Figure 2b). This minor species was not de-

(E52c.2 and E49i.2).
Added L-PK mRNA was used as an internal standard and hybridized
with an internal oligoprobe. In normal muscle, the fragment comprising
exons 49 to 52 is the 450 bp species. The additional 120 bp fragment
corresponds
to alternative splicing of exons 50 and 51. In the patient’s
muscle the 350 bp fragment corresponds
to the expected truncated
transcript
(exons 49-51-52).

tected in this patient (Figure 2a, 30 cycles). In this patient
no dystrophin was detected by Western blot analysis
using the “60 kd” antibody (see description in Experimental Procedures) (data not shown).
The same study was performed in two other cases: in
a DMD patient with a 7 to 13 exon deletion (case 7), we
found, after sequencing of the junction fragment, a precise splicing between exons 6 and 14 disrupting the reading frame; in a BMD patient with a gene deletion removing
exons 45 to 46 (case 12), the sequence of the segment of
transcript obtained after amplification
with primers in
exons 44 and 50 showed precise junction betwen exons
44 and 49 with a maintained reading frame (data not
shown).

Analysis of Dystrophin
Transcripts in Cases
in Which the Phenotype
(DMD or BMD) Is
in Contradiction
with the Reading
Frame Hypothesis
We have applied the same strategy to study truncated dystrophin transcripts in four exceptions to the reading frame
hypothesis (Monaco et al., 1966): two DMD cases and two
BMD cases.
Dystrophin
mRNA in DMD Patients
with an In-Frame Gene Deletion
The results obtained in two DMD cases with a gene deletion that apparently respected the reading frame (patients
1 and 2; Table 1) are shown in Figure 3. Patient 1 has a
severe DMD phenotype, and Southern blot analysis using
cDNA probes (9.7,30.2,30.1, and 47.4) showed a gene deletion removing unambiguously
exons 4 to 33. However,
owing to the presence of junction fragments detected with
the 9.7 and 47.4 cDNA probes, it was not possible to conclude about the reading frame since exons 3 and 34 might
be partially deleted. We therefore PCR amplified the truncated dystrophin transcript from muscle using primers located in exons 1 and 36. Two fragments hybridizing with
internal probes were obtained (Figure 3a). The major and
largest one, about 320 bp long, was purified and subjected to restriction by Maell and Xmnl. The resulting pattern was consistent with the presence of exon 2 (Xmnl site)
and exon 35 (Maell site) (Figure 3b). The sequence of this
fragment was determined after subcloning in Ml3 phage
and showed the precise junction between exon 2 and exon
35 (Figure 4~).
This shows unambiguously
that the genomic deletion in
this patient results in a truncated but in-frame dystrophin
mRNA, devoid of exons 3 to 34. The minor and smaller
fragment, about 140 bp long, was purified, subcloned,
and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence showed the
juxtaposition of exon 2 to exon 36, indicating that an alternative splicing of exon 35 had occurred (Figure 3d), without disruption of the reading frame. As already shown in
Figure lb, the amount of dystrophin transcript in muscle
is only slightly diminished in this large deletion (32 exons).
In this patient no dystrophin was detected (the expected
size is 243 kd) by Western blot analysis of a muscle biopsy
(Figure 4), using purified antibodies against either a proximal or a distal region of dystrophin. The 60 kd antibody
is directed against the 60 kd peptide encoded by nucleotides 1424-2647, which are contained in the 3-34 deletion; the P20 and DlO antibodies recognize a peptide corresponding
to nucleotides 5626-7141 and 9060-9791,
respectively, and are distal to the deletion.
Patient 2 (Table 1) is 11 years old and considered as
DMD, although he is still able to walk a few steps. Upon
Southern blot analysis of the dystrophin gene, exons 6 to
13 were found to be deleted. Using primers in exons 3 and
15, a single segment of dystrophin mRNA of about 300 bp
was PCR amplified from a muscle biopsy from this patient, but not from a normal control. This segment exhibited the expected restriction map (Figure 3e). Its sequence showed the precise juxtaposition of exon 5 to exon
14 (Figures 3f and 3g), with maintenance of the reading
frame. The relative amount of truncated dystrophin tran-

Two cases with a BMD phenotype and apparent out-offrame gene deletions were analyzed (patients 10 and 11;

deletion removing exons 3 to 7 (Gilgenkrantz et al., 1989).
script

To explore the expected truncated transcript as well as
other species resulting from conceivable alternative splicing, we amplified muscle RNA using two couples of
primers, located in exons 1 and 8 and 1 and 10, respectively. The results obtained after 15 cycles are shown in
Figure 5a. The major species (illustrated by a 155 bp fragment with the Eli-E8c primer couple, designated B in Figure 5a, and a 455 bp fragment with the Eli-ElOc primer
couple, designated A in Figure 5a) is the expected truncated transcript in which exons 2 and 8 are juxtaposed.
In addition, two minor species were detected: a 144 bp

cDNA fragments obtained in patient 10 after PCR amplification of muscle dystrophin mRNA were subcloned and
sequenced (data partially shown in Figure 5). The sequencing data showed that the different transcript species
correspond to different splicing patterns: between exons
2 and 8 (fragments A and B, Figure 5a), between exons
2 and 10 (fragment C, Figures 5b and 5d), and between
exons 1 and 8 (fragment E, Figure 5b). In each case the
exons were precisely spliced, without any sequence abnormality, other than the random errors due to the Taq
polymerase. Among the different splicing* patterns observed, only the juxtaposition of exon 1 with exon 8, and
exon 2 with exon 10, restores the reading frame.
After 30 PCR cycles (Figure 5b), the minor E and C species were clearly seen in the patient, and an additional 81
bp segment corresponding
to a 1 to 10 splicing (fragment
F, Figure 5b) was detected. Interestingly, after 30 cycles,
control muscle samples also exhibited the presence of the
four species B, C, E, and F (Figure 5b). This suggests that
these patterns of alternative splicing do occur even in normal muscle. After combining the results obtained after 15
cycles and 30 cycles, we can roughly estimate the relative
amounts of the different transcript species in patient 11:
2-8 >> 2-10 > 1-8 > l-10 (bold type indicating the in-frame
species). The 2-10 transcript is at least 10 times more
abundant in the patient than in the control muscle specimen. To estimate the level of dystrophin mRNA in this

fragments described in the first section, we have also amplified a segment contained between exons 49 and 5O,,distal to the breakpoint. It was found to be about 25% of the
normal specimen (fragment D, Figure 5a).
At the protein level, reduced amounts (about 10% of a
normal muscle sample) of a truncated dystrophin were
seen on Western blot analysis using 60 kd (Figure 6a),
DlO, and P20 antibodies (data not shown). The reduction
of size of this abnormal dystrophin (exons 3 to 7 correspond to 165 codons) is at least equal to two in-frame
BMD deletions removing 220 and 254 codons, respectively (deletions of exons 45 to 46 and of exons 45 to 49;
Figure Sa). However, at this level of molecular weight, it is
difficult to conclude that the observed size of the dystrophin corresponds precisely to the translation of the 2-10
alternatively spliced transcript (289 deleted codons). Immu-

nofluorescence assay using the 60 kd antibody showed a
reduced and patchy staining of the patient muscle sarcolemma (Figure 6d).
Patient 11 (Gilgenkrantz et al., 1989) is another patient
with a typical BMD phenotype and a deletion removing
exons 3 to 7 of the dystrophin gene that disrupts the reading frame. The dystrophin transcripts were explored in
muscle, using the same primers as in the preceding case.
Similar results were obtained, but in this case the species
corresponding
to the in frame 2-10 splicing was more
abundant than in patient 10, and the residual amount of
mRNA, estimated by amplification of a more distal segment (as in the case described above) was only slightly diminished (data not shown). Western blot analysis of muscle extracts showed the same qualitative results as in
patient 10 (Figure Sa).

Discussion
Consequences
of Genomic Deletions
on Muscle Dystrophin
mRNA Level
Mature dystrophin transcripts were detected in muscle
specimens from all the DMD patients investigated (ten individuals). This result is in agreement with previous data
(Oronzi-Scott et al., 1988; Chelly et al., 1988; Muntoni and
Strong, 1989). In this study, quantitative analysis shows
that the amount of transcript may be categorized into two
classes. In one class (eight patients), the amount of residual mRNA is drastically reduced (<lo%); in the other (two
patients), it is only slightly diminished. Interestingly, cases
with a frameshift deletion belong to the former group; conversely, the two DMD cases without frameshift belong to
the latter group. This suggests that there is a possible
impact of premature translation termination on the steadystate level of mRNA. This problem has already been considered, in particular in nonsense and frameshift mutations in the P-globin gene, where the presence of an early
translation termination
codon correlates unequivocally
with a decrease in the steady-state level of mRNA (Baserga et al., 1988). Although it is usually presumed that
premature termination of translation destabilizes the mRNA
released by polysomes, it has also been claimed that a
premature stop codon induces intranuclear instability of
the transcript and impairs its transport toward the cytoplasm (Takeshita et al., 1984; Humphries et al., 1984).
In contrast, in our three BMD patients muscle dystrophin mRNA was only slightly diminished. In one case (patient 12) the exon 45 to 48 deletion did not perturb the
reading frame. In the two others (patients 10 and 11) with
an out-of-frame deletion (exons 3 to 7), we found a predominant out-of-frame species (splicing between exons 2
and 8) plus two minor alternatively spliced in-frame species (exons 2 to 10 and 1 to 8 splicing). This is in apparent
contradiction with the above-mentioned
results obtained
in DMD. This finding suggests that, for the DMD gene, a
premature stop codon may not be sufficient per se to affect drastically the nuclear or cytoplasmic stability of the
dystrophin transcript. This is in line with the presence of
as much as 25% of the normal level of dystrophin mRNA
(Chamberlain et al., 1988; J. C., unpublished data) in muscle from mdx mice, which harbors a nonsense mutation
at position 3185 in the dystrophin cDNA (Sicinski et al.,
1989).
Possible Explanations
for DMD and BMD Cases
with Deletions Transgressing
the Reading Frame Rule
The reading frame rule proposed by Monaco et al. (1988)
was found applicable in 92% of the deletions investigated
in 258 DMD and BMD cases (Koenig et al., 1989). It was
also corroborated by studies at the protein level (Hoffman
et al., 1988). The remaining 8% are in apparent contradiction with the reading frame theory, either because an apparent in-frame deletion results in DMD, or, conversely, because an apparent out-of-frame deletion results in BMD.
Direct sequence analysis of and around the junction point
of truncated dystrophin mRNA helped us not only to deter-

mine the authentic reading frame, but also to look for additional alternative splicing patterns, which might explain
the exceptions to the reading frame theory.
We thus sequenced the dystrophin transcript across
the junction point in seven cases with internal deletions of
the dystrophin gene. In all cases but one, the sequence
of the single or major transcript corresponded precisely to
the one deduced from DNA analysis using cDNA probes.
In the remaining deletion, a DMD patient (patient 1; see
details in Results), the two exons corresponding
to the
junction fragments seen on Southern blots were absent
from the mature transcript that was in frame. In addition
to this case, three other cases, one DMD and two BMD,
represented apparent exceptions to the reading frame
rule.
In the in-frame DMD cases the following results were
obtained: by dystrophin cDNA probing of genomic DNA a
single deletion could be detected, which was apparently
in frame (cases 1 and 2); by cDNA PCR amplification
across the deletion, the expected in-frame truncated transcript was obtained; in both cases the relative amount of
residual transcript was almost normal; by Western blot no
truncated dystrophin was detected with polyclonal antibodies directed against nondeleted domains of the protein. We believe that the most likely hypotheses are that
in these cases, the truncated in-frame transcript is translated into an unstable protein (not detected by Western
blot analysis), or is not efficiently translated. Whereas in
one case (patient 1) the size of the deletion was very large,
removing 43% of the protein, in the other case (patient 2)
the deletion was much smaller, removing only 11%. This
indicates that, whatever the mechanism and probably
within certain limits (such as in-frame deletions 13-60 and
lo-53 reported by Koenig et al., 1989), the absence of the
protein is not necessarily correlated to the deletion size.
This lack of correlation is also suggested by recent reports
in which a deletion removing 46% (England et al., 1990)
or 21% (Gospe et al., 1989) of the protein in the repeat region was only responsible for a very mild form of BMD or
for myalgias, respectively.
We have found in the literature four other DMD cases
with an in-frame deletion in the Yregion of the gene (Koenig et al., 1989; den Dunnen et al., 1989). A comparison
of the extent and site of the deletion present in these cases
and in our two cases does not readily point to a specific
common region that would be critical for the protein stability or for the mRNA efficient translation. One may anticipate that the absence of a protein segment comprising the
distal part of the N-terminal (a-actinin-like) and the beginning of the spectrin-like domain would be critical. However, there are at least two cases reported with a deletion
in the same region, and which yet give rise to a BMD
phenotype (Koenig et al., 1989; den Dunnen et al., 1989).
These differences might be explained by a different impact on the final tertiary structure of the protein, affecting
ultimately the dimerization
and network formation that
have been recently suggested (Koenig and Kunkel, 1990).
The two BMD exceptions had an out-of-frame deletion
removing exons 3 to 7 (patients 10 and 11). This deletion
is the most frequent one in the 5’ region of the gene giving

Cell
1246

rise to BMD disease (Malhotra et al., 1988). We found in
both patients a major out-of-frame transcript with the expected truncation, i.8, containing exons 1, 2, and 8. In addition, three minor additional transcripts, resulting from alternative splicing, were also found in the two cases: two
of them, joining exons 2 and 10 and 1 and 8, respectively,
restore the reading frame, the third one, less abundant,
joins exons 1 and 10 and is still out of frame. These results
suggest that the milder BMD phenotype may be due to
translation of the minor in-frame transcripts, although they
approximately represent about 10/o-2% of the major outof-frame species. Noteworthy is the fact that the mature
dystrophin transcripts were only moderately diminished,
which indicates that the truncated primary transcript is
stable, thus enabling the alternatively spliced species to
be produced at a significant level.
This quantitative factor may be of paramount importance in the determination of the final phenotype. Indeed
in these BMD cases, on Western blots, a reduced amount
of a truncated dystrophin was seen, compatible with the
size predicted from the alternative splicing pattern. The residual amount of the shortened dystrophin was about
lo%, which classifies this patient between severe and
moderate BMD, according to Hoffman’s classification (Hoffman and Kunkel, 1989). The apparent discrepancy between the amount of in-frame transcripts and the amount
of truncated dystrophin could be due to the mRNA PCR
procedure. In fact, the partially different composition of the
two amplified sequences (155 bp corresponding
to l-2-8
spliced species and 144 bp correponding to l-2-10 spliced
species) and the use of different complementary
primers
might have resulted in a different yield of amplification
(Chelly et al., 1990), hampering the comparison of the amplified product amounts.
As shown in Figure 5, the same alternative transcripts
were also detected in normal muscle, at a much lower level
than in muscle from BMD with the 3 to 7 genomic deletion.
The 2-10 species, for instance, represents about 0.1% to
0.3% of the normal dystrophin transcript in normal muscle
(data not shown), i.e, at least 10 times less than what we
found in the muscle of these patients. The relative increase
of the in-frame alternatively spliced transcripts in the BMD
cases may be due to a facilitation of the rare splicing
events, due to the juxtaposition of exons 2 and 8 on the primary transcript. In fact, as emphasized by Malhotra et al.
(1988) similar 3 to 7 deletions may produce a variety of
phenotypes: DMD, BMD, or intermediate forms. We believe
that this heterogeneity may be explained by differences in
the amount of in-frame transcripts, due to differential impact of different intronic breakpoints on the stability of the
primary transcript. To check this hypothesis, we looked for
the alternatively spliced dystrophin transcript (2-10 species)
in muscle from three DMD patients (cases 4, 5, and 6)
whose dystrophin mRNA is normal in the region of exons
1 to 10. In those patients, the amount of dystrophin transcript is very low (Figure l), and as expected, the minor 2-10
alternatively spliced species are so scarce that they could
not be detected after 30 cycles (data not shown).
In addition, we investigated one DMD patient and one
BMD patient carrying apparently the same deletion of exon

50. In the DMD muscle sample (case 13) we found a reduced level of the expectedly spliced out&frame
dystrophin mRNA (4951) but we failed to detect the in-frame 49-52
minor alternatively spliced species that is found in normal
muscle (Figure 2a, 30 cycles). In the BMD patient (Lindldf
et al., 1989) the only material available was fibroblasts.
Through illegitimate transcription (Chelly et al., 1989) it
was possible to investigate dystrophin transcripts in these
cells. Using nested PCR, we found the expected out-offrame 49-51 transcript as a major species, and a minute
amount of the in-frame alternatively spliced 49-52 transcript (Chelly et al., unpublished data). Altogether these
results are consistent with the hypothesis that, besides
their qualitative effect on the reading frame, deletions exert an impact on the phenotype through differential quantitative effects on the dystrophin mRNA.
The alternative splicing pattern does not occur at random, since in the regions explored (exons 1 to 10, and
exons 43 to 52) we could not demonstrate any other species than the splicing between exon 2 and exon 8, exon
2 and exon 10, exon 1 and exon 8, exon 1 and exon 10 in
the 5’ region, and exon 49 and exon 52 in the more distal
part of the gene. In their search for normal alternative
splicing in the dystrophin gene, Feener et al. (1989) did not
report the minor spliced species that we found in the 5’region. This may be due to differences in experimental
procedures.
To explain the out-of-frame BMD exceptions, Malhotra et
al. (1988) suggested that molecular explanations
other
than alternative splicing might also be responsible for
restoring the reading frame beyond the breakpoint: reinitiation of translation, or usage of a putative promoter
located in the intron preceding exon 8. The latter hypotheses still remain speculative and await experimental support. The correction of the reading frame by reinitiation of
translation in exon 8 is not sufficient by itself to explain the
phenotypic heterogeneity observed for the 3 to 7 deletions, since the mature transcript is expected to be identical in DMD and BMD cases. Moreover, these hypotheses
would not apply to the more distal out-of-frame milder
forms, such as the above-mentioned
BMD case with an
out-of-frame deletion of exon 50. A definitive answer would
be provided by comparing the amount of dystrophin transcripts in DMD and BMD patients with a 3 to 7 deletion,
and also by immunological
characterization
of the truncated dystrophin with antibodies precisely directed against
exon-specific peptides.

Analysis

The patients were classified as DMD (wheelchair bound before age 12)
or BMD (wheelchair bound at age 16 or later). In all cases the diagnosis
was ascertained by serum CPK activity and muscle histological pattern. Deletion breakpoints in the dystrophin gene were mapped relative
to exons by Southern blot analysis of Hindlll digests of genomic DNA,
using cDNA probes covering 9 kb of cDNA dystrophin
(Koenig et al.,
1989). In some cases, additional studies included EcoRl and Bglll
maps and DNA amplification
of specific exons.

and was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis
followed by ethidium
bromide staining. The exogenous
RNA added for coamplification
was
rat liver ANA. Oiigonucleotide
primers were synthetized
according to
the dystrophin sequence published by Koenig et al. (1988). Nucleotide
sequence of primers complementary(c)
and identical (i) to mRNA sequence are indicated in figures and legends.
Coamplification
of several fragments
of the dystrophin
transcript
was performed
as described
in detail in Chelly et al. (1990). To 1-5 ug
of total RNA under investigation,
an exogenous
sample of reference
RNA (0.2 ug of total rat liver RNA) was added as a source of internal
standard mRNA (L-PK). cDNA was synthetized
by simultaneous
extension of different dystrophin-specific
primers (lOc, 44c, and 62~) and
L-PK-specific
primers (Chelly et al.. 1989). In some cases the cDNA
was synthesized
by random priming using hexanucleotide
primers as
a template to the reverse transcriptase
enzyme (MMLV; Bethesda Research Laboratories).
After this first step, coamplification
was carried
out with three couples of primers corresponding
to the dystrophin transcript (see Figure 1); L-PK primers were included in each vial for coamplification. After 15 cycles, half of the sample volume was removed
from each vial and the remainder was submitted to 15 further cycles
of amplification.
Reaction products (after 15 cycles) were subjected to
acrylamide
gel electrophoresis,
transferred
to nylon membrane,
and
hybridized
to labeled internal oligoprobes
or cDNA probes (see
figures). Relative quantitation
was achieved by densitometry
of autoradiograms
exposed for variable times, using L-PK signal as a standard (Chelly et al., 1989).
Truncated
transcripts
of the dystrophin
gene from DMD and BMD
patients were amplified by PCR using primers flanking the junction
point. With muscle RNA, 30 to 35 cycles of PCR amplification
were carried out to obtain sufficient
material. The amplified fragments
were
separated
by electrophoresis
in a low-melting
agarose
gel (4%
Nusieve, FMC) or in an acrylamide
gel (8% [w/v]). Gels were stained
with ethidium bromide, and the specific fragments that had been previously attested by specific hybridization
and restriction
map analysis
were cut out, purified, phosphorylated,
and ligated into Smal-digested
Ml3 mpl0 vector. Single-strand
Ml3 DNA from recombinant
clones
was sequenced
by the P-dideoxy method using [%]dATP
and T7
DNA polymerase
(Sequenase,
US Biochemical
Corp.). In each case,
at least three independent
clones were sequenced.
Dystrophin
Analysis
lmmunoblot analysis of total muscle extracts was performed
using purified antibodies as described
by Hoffman and Kunkel (1989) raised
in sheep against fusion proteins: the mouse 60 kd peptide corresponds
to amino acids 407-813 (nucleotides
1424-2647)
(Hoffman
et al.,
1987); the human 30 kd peptide corresponds
to amino acids 1181-1388
(nucleotides
3845-4372)
(Hoffman et al., 1987); the human DlO peptide corresponds
to amino acids 2897-3193
(nucleotides
90809791)
(Koenig and Kunkel, 1990); the human P20 peptide corresponds
to
amino acids 1750-2248
(nucleotides
5826-7l41;
I. B. Ginjaar et al.,

Indirect immunodetection
was performed on 5 pm transverse
frozen
cryostat sections
using the 60 kd polyclonal antibodies and fluorescein-labeled
rabbit anti-sheep
IgG.
