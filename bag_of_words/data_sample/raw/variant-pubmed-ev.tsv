Protein analysis demonstrated normal parental collagen. Mutation resulted in only a small decreased of collagen type I melting temperature, suggesting mild effect on helix structure. Fibroblast collagen production was not reduced relative to age-matched control fibroblasts and collagen secretion was not noticeably impaired. Patient O168: 7y/o boy with blue sclerae and DI, moderately short stature, well-aligned limbs, few fractures, and normal gait. Authors say that protein analysis of parental collagen suggests that the mutation was sporadic in this case, but there is no evidence the authors sequenced the parents to determine conclusively.

Because of the conserved nature of the zinc fingers between WT1 and Egr-1, WT1 presumably behaves in a similar manner. Important side chains involved in these contacts would include an arginine that immediately precedes an a helix and that hydrogen bonds with a guanine (highlighted in the Egr-1 recognition sequence: 5'-GCGGGGGCG-3') (see Figures 5A and 5B).

Identification of Yonago protein C molecular defect (p.ArgGly) and calcium experimental data. Yonago variant was identified in a prot C def case with recurrent thrombosis. Segregated in family (4 others with Prot C deficiency but no thrombosis). No other abnormal proteins in hemostatic biochem studies. Experiment using Yonago patient's plasma showed a 50% defect in adopted a calcium-dependent conformation of the GLA domain as evidence by binding to calcium dependent of independent monoclonal antibodies. Sanger sequencing of GLA domain identified molecular defect. I consider this WEAK experimental data.

[1986]) and a G>A polymorphism in exon 6 (position 629 of the cDNA). The mutation at position 1081 causes an amino acid substitution of valine for alanine at position 329 of the protein sequence. The polymorphism at position 629 does not affect the amino acid sequence. Analysis of the cDNA sequence around the 1081 mutation revealed that a new BalI restriction site had been formed. Patient LB and her parents were examined to determine whether she was homozygous for the mutation. Patient LB demonstrates only the abnormal restriction fragment of 1.8 kb. Both of her parents carry one normal fragment of 2.6 kb and one abnormal fragment of 1.8 kb. Patient LB is homozygous for this mutation. Seven additional ADA-deficient patients (and/or their parents) followed at our institution were screened by Southern analysis in looking for this mutation. Two additional patients from the seven families tested carried this mutation; one (patient B) in addition to LB is homozygous for the mutation, and another (patient BJ) is heterozygous for the mutation. (Data from the normal families are not included.) The homozygous state found in LB and JB can likely be explained by their parents being related. By combining data on eight families followed at our institution with data on five other families reported in the literature, we established that five of 13 patients (seven of 22 alleles) with known or suspected point mutations have this defect. This mutation was found to be associated with three different ADA haplotypes. FUNCTIONAL: B lymphoblastoid cell lines were established from Ficoll-Hypaque-purified peripheral mononuclear cells by Epstein-Barr virus transformation. Enzymatic studies have confirmed the patients' lack of ADA enzymatic activity (Markert et al. 1987a). HLA typing was used to confirm the identity of the cell lines. SM: So 3 families with 3 affecteds. LB and JB are homs and the parents were hets. BJ was het for this variant and father not available for testing, unclear what the second variant is in this individual.

Transfected cells had ADA mRNAs of approximately 1.6 kb, the same size as the endogenous message. However, ADA message levels were 15-25-fold higher in cells transfected with these vectors than in cells transfected with plasmids that did not contain ADA sequences. The predominant ADA mRNA species in cells transfected with pADA-del4 was only about 1.4 kb. The ADA message of 1.4 kb could only have been transcribed from the transfected vector and not from the endogenous gene. (HERE STARTS THE ODD LOGIC) Since the intensity of the 1.4-kb band is approximately equivalent to the intensity of the 1.6-kb band for cells transfected with the other ADA vectors, the increased ADA message levels must be derived from the transfected vectors and not the endogenous gene. Thus, the failure of the mutant ADA constructions to show increased expression of ADA activity is a reflection of the effect of the mutations on protein stability and/or catalytic activity and not the level of transcription or stability of the mRNA.

We identified a point mutation in each allele of the ADA-deficient cell line GM2756. In one allele, amino acid 329 is changed from alanine to valine. In the second allele, amino acid 211 is changed from arginine to histidine. cDNAs corresponding to poly(A)+ RNAs encoded by both ADA alleles for the cell line GM2756 were cloned and sequenced . Each allele has a single point mutation affecting the amino acid sequence and several point mutations not affecting the amino acid sequence. Compared to the consensus ADA cDNA sequence, clone 2756-13b has a base change at position 1081 (GCG to GTG), which results in an amino acid change of alanine to valine at amino acid 329. Clone 2825A-10 represents the other ADA allele of this cell line. It has only one point mutation that alters an amino acid. This mutation at base 1081 (GCG to GTG) changes amino acid 329 from alanine to valine. While this change is identical to the one seen in clone 2756-13b, these clones do not represent the same ADA allele. Each has another distinct mutation that does not alter the amino acid sequence. The immunoprecipitable ADA protein in GM2825A is <5% of that in normal cells despite normal levels of translatable mRNAs, suggesting that that ADA encoded by the full-length mRNA species represented by clone 2825A-10 is also unstable. It is likely that the defect in this allele, a point mutation altering alanine-329 to valine, affects ADA protein stability. SM: bleh this is confusing and it doesn't appear that any of these cell lines or clones contain ONLY the A329V variant (they all have additional variants), will include in writeup, but no points			True	2018-05-01 00:39:34.192111+00:00	pmn	EV0024|EV0027	Experimental: Protein function disrupted, weak evidence|Experimental: Splicing defect, weak evidence	functional_experiments

By Northern blot analysis a novel beta-globin RNA species, 1500 nucleotides in length, was detected in erythroid RNA. Nuclease protection studies of erythroid RNA, as well as RNA generated upon transient expression of the cloned mutant gene in HeLa cells, located the 3' terminus of this novel, polyadenylated RNA 900 nucleotides downstream of the normal poly(A) addition site, within 15 nucleotides of the first AATAAA in the 3' -flanking region of the 3- globin gene. These findings define the in vivo terminus of an elongated RNA and establish that human 3-globin transcription may extend at least 900 nucleotides 3' of the normal polyadenylation site.
